850068 i chose to show up for those professionals who brought me energy by connecting with me touching me gently and appropriately making direct eye contact with me and speaking calmly i responded positively to positive treatment the professionals who did not connect with me sapped my energy so i protected myself by ignoring their requests

850097 reasons not to use technology and my refutations 1 the legal issues are scary what if a student writes inappropriate content online um have you ever seen the desktop at the back of the classroom it covers vocab no teacher dares to mention 2 the teacher education and support necessary to train teachers is scary do it anyway teachers need to be on the forefront of curriculum not in its wake 3 adding more to a teachers plate is scary of course it is but take something off rather than put more on have an administrator cover yard duty so that you can actually focus on teaching instruction and practice for your next class 4 kids knowing more than the teachers is scary to some teachers or it can be a very powerful tool regardless of your philosophies the gap ever widens as we ignore its existence 5 some students dont have access to technology at home so how can we expect them to do it well many homes dont have libraries either so its a schools job to step up and provide even though some students may not have access to a computer at home the school needs to see its role in equalizing the differences between those who have it and those who do not technology is the great information equalizer

850152 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
850153 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness says the monk who resides in a monastery of the order of friars minor capuchin in stalowa wola southern poland
850154 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
850155 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
850156 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
850157 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
850158 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
850159 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist

850165 the netherlands newest rudolf steiner school is to be built in kralingen rotterdam
850166 almost the entire building has been constructed with a green fa ade and roof that makes the transition passage to what lies behind as gentle as possible
850167 underneath are gardens outside spaces that can also be used as secluded nooks for teachers to retreat for reflection and relaxation here a space arises as if among cultivated foliage seeping through the entwined branches

850183 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
850184 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
850185 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
850186 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
850187 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
850188 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
850189 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things

850254 the proposed final rules are intended to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts and practices in mortgage lending while keeping credit available to qualified borrowers and supporting sustainable homeownership
850255 importantly the new rules will apply to all mortgage lenders not just those supervised and examined by the federal reserve besides offering broader protection for consumers a uniform set of rules will level the playing field for lenders and increase competition in the mortgage market to the ultimate benefit of borrowers
850256 these changes have made for better rules that will go far in protecting consumers from unfair practices and restoring confidence in our mortgage system

850271 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
850272 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
850273 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on

850449 i played a bit more aggressive and served a little bit smarter than i had in the past and obviously it worked
850450 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
850451 with this waiting list well have a list of applicants who want to move to the court targeted areas
850452 its the first time since 2004 that people have a new opportunity to sign up for the settlement vouchers to be used in predominately white areas
850453 this is a small number of vouchers issued for victims of past discrimination
850454 first and foremost he was a gentleman of the old school one of the most gracious human beings youd ever meet
850455 he wasnt one to sing his own praises so well have to do it for him he was like a second father to me im missing him already
850456 it just seemed natural to combine surfing with moviemaking and to record my hobby i didnt think too much of it at the time not as a way of making a living
850457 but i got more awards and praise the last few years than when i was making films
850458 bruce brown suggested we team up and i said can we do that i called him up and in 15 minutes he was down at our office because he could get out to the surf he shot some things that were mindblowing
850459 he certainly had a much wider influence than people just watching his films
850460 his films captured the free spirted nature and they were more reflective of this zany life of surfing and because he made more films and had a longer career he was definately the icon that led to quiksilver and billabong and what people call the industry today but he would be the last person to say that he just made films he didnt have any larger goals
850461 when he put together a film it wasnt just about the surfing it was about the lifestyle
850462 he was a little different maybe it was because he was older than the people he was dealing with but he always had a wonderful sense of humor in how he documented that time
850463 that is just amazing no its not amazing its wonderful the respect meter just goes up big time
850464 a time that has come and gone when we look at it now we realiz how precious it was we try to emulate it now but it will never be the same

850467 when including base salary average overtime and night shift differential holiday pay and uniform allowance a new police officer will earn over 40 000 on average in the first year and 82 000 on average after 5 1 2 years of service
850468 its all cool i make too much money as it is anyway
850469 doing another get out of town alive budget would do nothing to help this state but rather would endanger californians standard of living and economic future
850470 major borrowing is not part of the democratic budget plan and we dont believe it should be part of the final solution our proposal balances the budget with a mix of billions of dollars in difficult spending cuts and new revenues similar to those proposed by a previous republican governor its gimmick free and honest it closes our budget gap in a straight forward manner and eliminates out year deficits
850471 not surprisingly those who have benefited from both federal and state tax breaks in the past namely wealthy californians and major corporations have the most to contribute in these difficult times
850472 legislative democrats are proud to present our conference committee budget proposal for california s 2008 2009 fiscal year
850473 i think this is their way of looking at it and im sure they have their reasons
850474 and i think this is what makes the world go around people have different ideas for how to solve a problem

850544 and the way we run the ball here you have to block everybody you cant be shy or you wont play
850545 i believe more and more that the game has gotten to the point where wide receivers are big strong physical players and i want to make sure we take that approach
850546 that we buy into it that we believe it whenever you see the plus 20 yard gain its because theyve caught the ball and gone vertical
850547 let it wear for a month or so and then see what adjustments it needs
850548 in parts of the south its taken very seriously and in other parts of the country theyre looked at with near disbelief

850578 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
850579 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
850580 we have seen more than one million black bearded wildebeests migrate from serengeti to mara this is the climax of this years tourism in the mara
850581 the uniqueness of the area and the preservation it provides to so many species living in harmony
850582 more than one million wildebeests half a million gazelles and 200 000 zebras constantly on the move theyre all in search of fresh grass and water welcome to the serengeti and the masai mara plains in the heart of east africa the seventh new wonder of the world
850583 its one of the great wonders in terms of animal migrations
850584 serengeti mara ecosystems are considered to be perhaps the last of the ecosystems in which human impact is less than five per cent
850585 if theyre not birthing 300 000 calves in the three week period theyre leaping into rivers for 20 feet up
850586 it would be astonishing and wondrous to watch the migrations go by
850587 they call them the clowns because when you look at a wildebeest he looks like he was made up of the leftovers of all the other animals
850588 they have like a head of a buffalo have tail of a horse they have legs of an antelope they just dont look very balanced
850589 without the migration its harder to conceive serengeti mara being what it is today
850590 they just move and hopefully wherever they are going they can get as much grass and as much water as possible
850591 the wildebeests go for the middle and then the herd beasts like the gazelles go for the lowest part
850592 if the climate changes drastically then this whole equilibrium this whole tune up this whole finely tuned movement is going to be thrown out of phase
850593 we wont be able to expand globally only with koreans
850594 if kyokushuzan batbayar makes a breakthrough mongolia could expect more development assistance from japan which would cement his popularity at home
850595 by offering banking services on cellphones via a network of local merchants who will handle the cash transactions xacbank will make it affordable for mongolians who use only cash today to take advantage of secure financial services
850596 this means farmers and nomadic herders will have a safer place to store their money
850597 we anticipate that the project will provide insights on customer uptake in dispersed areas that are applicable beyond mongolia
850598 mongolia has one of the lowest population densities in the world about one person per square kilometer
850599 so cellphone banking services will have a considerable impact in offering wider access convenience and cost efficiency as well as increased speed and reliability for transactions

850632 when it started there were like 130 artists strictly fine art
850633 ive heard clients say that theyre upset with the number and quality of artists this year
850634 ever since we put the gate up in 2005 the artists havent liked it
850635 but we try to boost attendance and hopefully more people will stop by when theyre walking through
850636 no matter how it happens were trying to build new things
850637 i hope the artists are seeing results i hope they do better

850676 but in that moment i learned that it was kill or be killed
850677 most of these men and women have never spoken about their experiences in great detail
850678 their memories are bottled up and theyre willing to let them go after decades of silence
850679 its a fascinating experience not only for myself but for them as well
850680 theyre really just average citizens who were thrust into these adverse circumstances
850681 i think most veterans just dont like talking about it
850682 i never told war stories until a few years ago
850683 its one of those things that every year the kids at public school would talk about
850684 my daughter aubrie is in 12th grade and i wanted to give her a prom
850685 and you get an education thats tailored to your needs
850686 we get together and its kind of an enrichment program
850687 and we have more time to do work we dont have to wait on anybody
850688 my ap advanced placement students use social networking to stay in touch
850689 well i say who is sitting next to that kid while he takes those classes
850690 youd be surprised at how many homeschool groups are in the area
850691 child safety and child protection easy steps you can take
850692 i dont know what about adolf i mean that name would kind of suck to have
850693 i mean why not just call your kid satan and be done with it
850694 that is like the girliest reason to be a fan of a team
850695 someone somewhere some help me settle what is on my mind
850696 when i look at the heavens the moon and the stars which you have created who is steve that you are mindful of him
850697 i will dwell in the house of the lord forever
850698 we put everything back together again presumably so no harm no foul right
850699 i called taylor and asked to be part of that dream
850700 there were times in my life when i couldnt have afforded a coach so i know how valuable a gift like this is it would have eliminated my having to do it the hard way
850701 the most important point is initially the clients dont know what to expect
850702 they think im just going to give them a set of goals i try to give us a chance to get to know and trust each other i get them to trust me so they can learn what coaching is all about
850703 i was at a crossroad and gail asked me for my story
850704 i had dated a superior at work and the relationship didnt work out soon afterwards i was fired i had to sell my house and the only job i could find paid about a third of what i had made before i began to ask myself a lot of questions about what i would do for the rest of my life
850705 gail showed me how to take responsibility for my own behavior and set boundaries with people she taught me about envisioning what you want instead of just getting career coaching i ended up learning life skills
850706 she was willing to do everything we talked about that made all the difference we could have come up with all kinds of ideas but without her follow through nothing would have happened
850707 some of the clients have extreme challenges and its hard to avoid getting pulled into the drama
850708 coaches need to watch the boundaries between therapy and coaching its not easy to not get pulled into the drama
850709 i coached a woman who had a problem with drug addition and during our time together she fell off the wagon
850710 our sessions were disrupted and she started missing appointments i recognized that she needed professional support for her problem i told her to contact me if i could help her later and i detached with love
850711 i like the sense that im giving something back and helping other women you can see the results from week to week championing these women
850712 when i first started getting coaching i hated my job for me the shift was my gaining a sense of purpose it became a challenge to see how well i could do the job
850713 now i look forward to going to work and i enjoy the people i work with
850714 we teach women the skills theyll need in the workforce
850715 thats where a hand up coaching comes in it opens doors so that women see what they can do with their lives
850716 the profound effect coaching had on their outlook overwhelmed us
850717 we saw their increased self esteem and motivation it was like the cinderellas transformation from a kitchen drudge to a princess
850718 if they can each help one person its made a difference

850721 doesnt he know that if he did that to the wrong person he could get dragged down an alley by his hair and capped in the head

850723 you fucking psycho dont even talk about my son like that
850724 hey be cool shes obviously got some serious issues let me help you get off at the next stop
850725 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
850726 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
850727 work with the dncc to estimate the conventions carbon footprint
850728 it looks as though the population believes climate change is serious and there seems to be momentum behind the issue and there are some people who dont like that
850729 there are still plenty of creationists around and there are people who believe tobacco is not linked to serious health effects and so there are still people who choose to ignore or doubt the amount of evidence for climate change
850730 we would kill literally kill for a good paper that proved the science on global warming was wrong
850731 then i could retire and accept my chair at harvard unfortunately thats not going to happen and theres vast amounts of evidence why
850732 in essence the models we use to predict climate have been proven right
850733 the conclusion of the conference is that there is only limited scope for reducing

850743 afflictions mix of former pride and ufc fighters may have struck a chord with this hardcore audience

850745 im a great believer in making things as simple as possible ive always contended that good communicators take something complicated and make it simple
850746 was a turning point it gave him strength and courage he had not had before
850747 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat

850811 they can re apply to the provincial board but they have to go back to the lower council the barangay and the municipal all the requirements of the committee must be properly addressed as well
850812 but we were informing the proponents in the last committee meeting that their efforts would be of no use because they still have to show the kind consideration that they have followed the requirements of the committee

850860 this is paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds
850861 the book um what book this book didnt exist in book form for at least 10 years after mohammeds death heres how it went down mohammed would appoint scribes to write his verses down on something anything parchment flat stones bits of leather leaves tree bark and even the shoulder blade bones of animals anything with a flat enough surface to write on was fair game
850862 send down to us a book that we could read
850863 i dont think the vast majority of muslims even know about all the pervy shit in the quran and hadith i think muslim apologetics help soften the blow when they do learn about these things i mean the first time i learned aisha was 9 when mohammed fucked her i took to the internets and what did i find the documents had accidentally dropped the 1 from her age she was really 19 shit like that

850870 wow it looks like dna has convicted him jan i know it probably was contaminated lol
850871 the dna linked the anthrax used in the mailing to a flask used in bruce ivins lab at the u s army medical institute of infectious diseases said the source who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case
850872 authorities were looking at whether ivins released anthrax as a way to test a vaccine he was working on another official said
850873 using new genome technology researchers looked at samples of cells from the victims to identify the kind of anthrax ames strain that killed them the scientist said
850874 still the scientist said some researchers will probably note the dna does not alone give the government a smoking gun or other surefire case closer
850875 the fbi recruited top genome researchers from across the country and encouraged them to do groundbreaking work to identify and isolate the type of anthrax in the attacks at least 10 million was spent on the research in what the scientist called the fbis most expensive and scientifically compelling case to date

850917 my impression is that iblis is an angel and satan is someone else
850918 nobody really even knows whether iblis is a jinn or an angel and the quran seems to say hes both fucked up
850919 iblis used to do what the angels did and resembled them in their devotion and worship so he was included when they were addressed but he disobeyed and went against what he was told to do
850920 im gonna punch that fucker in the face the next time i see him no enemy of mine is going to marry me and get away with it

850923 iblis is an angel hes several thousand years old and is being told hes worth less than new coke no wonder iblis gave god the double bird
850924 i kinda wondered if its because many dogs practically worship their owners
850925 god told the angels to bow before adam satan said no god demanded an explanation satans reply was that he loved god and could only follow gods commandments and god had said to have no others before him
850926 6 who verily knows and who can here declare it whence it was born and whence comes this creation the gods are later than this worlds production who knows then whence it first came into being 7 he the first origin of this creation whether he formed it all or did not form it whose eye controls this world in highest heaven he verily knows it or perhaps he knows not
850927 inclusive monotheism admitting multiple deities as manifestations of a single being
850928 interesting i kind of got the feeling that you guys were trying to somehow separate hinduism from all the other religions hold it to a higher standard not sure how i feel about that one
850929 if a logically sound proposition comes even from a boy or a parrot accept it if a logically unsound proposition comes even from an elderly person or an authority like sage shuka reject it
850930 ponder deeply over what i revealed then act as u think fit
850931 if a logically sound proposition comes even from a boy or a parrot accept it if a logically unsound proposition comes even from an elderly person or an authority like sage shuka reject it
850932 how does a society go from valuing free thinking to this
850933 my name is satyakama i am the son of jabala a prostitute therefore i am satyakama jabala my father is unknown please enrol me and impart knowledge
850934 mmm a la madre ya mero me sal a no me vuelve a pasar ya mero llego si aguanto
850935 chingada madre como eres pendejo ponte trucha ya casi llegas
850936 with so many guys out we wanted to make sure to maintain the discipline work hard and make sure that everybody put defending first
850937 we defended as a team we did well not pushing too many guys forward
850938 hes a hard worker he knows when to get back hes always been a pretty good defender no matter what position hes played
850939 he combines well already he had one short practice with the team
850940 we played clyde and joe one would step up and one would stay behind
850941 we worked on outside defending and just leaving jaime and luci up top to do the offense jaime and luci are pretty much all you really need on a team to create goals and thats what they did tonight
850942 its getting it over the first guy and kind of aiming it for the goal just to put pressure on the goalie coming out
850943 when you make decisions on guys to bring in you try to see them in your environment
850944 we received offers from multiple international clubs for kenny cooper during this transfer window but we elected to decline them all
850945 the international interest is a credit to kenny fc dallas and the ever increasing talent level in major league soccer
850946 weve actually had visitors who stumble on crab fest who have no connection to louisbourg who now come back every year for the event
850947 its become the unofficial come home weekend for louisbourg and area
850948 the end result was that they got provincial approval to open the first rural high school in nova scotia the iona federated high school
850949 the tenth priest fr hughie macneil was one of our co celebrants today at the mass
850950 the big switch there was that rankin was going to cover all grades from primary to 12
850951 hopefully it will be held the last full weekend of july of next year
850952 we were really sluggish we didnt play with a lot of energy
850953 the second half we were better had more energy pushing forward we could have easily got a goal in the box but for some reason we were not getting any goals
850954 the kid has matured a lot in the last three weeks and has built confidence
850955 hes a goal scorer hes always looking around and can make plays because hes also a good passer he got himself in two good spots tonight the first was taken away from him and the second he was calm enough to put away
850956 it always feels good to get that first goal in we got the win with that and that makes it twice as good
850957 this team is made of great players i wish to definitely make an impact
850958 from day one ive said weve got 28 good players
850959 our coaching staff believes in every player these young guys continue to help us when we need them
850960 every point is valuable especially at this time in the season and to come and get three points at home is big for us
850961 if it wasnt for the european traffic wed be dead
850962 it raises awareness it makes you busy for that period of time but it creates a short space of time when everyone wants to be in your inn or in your town
850963 im getting what weve got online and the ones who making advance reservations are coming
850964 if everybody is not filling all their rooms we dont get the overflow which is a factor because were off the beaten path
850965 i think the media really did us in in telling people theyre not going to travel they planted that seed and people said look maybe we should just stay closer to home
850966 there wasnt much for me to do its tough to mark us on set pieces there wasnt a whole lot of traction going off his waibels head and i was just in the right place and i did what i needed to do to put it away
850967 it always feels good to score a player like myself doesnt score a lot coming into this game i wanted to bounce back from last year because i felt like i let the team down this year i wanted to help the team out obviously tonight in the semi finals against pachuca i came out and was fortunate to get the goal
850968 it was a difficult game all games against the dynamo are difficult our only complaint was against the referee who did a poor job of controlling the game i think pachuca was very superior to the dynamo in spite of the fact that they scored two goals and won they were more effective and thats how they won the game
850969 its always like that when theyre losing at the end of the game its always going to be little brawls here and there its good though to play teams from other leagues so you know where you stand as a footballer
850970 the goal we scored was perfectly fine and it was taken away this is the same referee that we had to face a few months ago in the concacaf champions cup with the same tendency of damaging us this game had the same bad disposition because it wasnt only a goal that was called off but there were a lot of fouls that he didnt call in our favor this is not only against pachuca this is against all mexican teams
850971 it was an excellent win my players played well and worked hard it was a good way to win we knew tonight was going to be a difficult night but we scored some great goals and the crowd definitely enjoyed it as well
850972 this is huge for me because pachuca i definitely wanted to beat because they are a great team and now we have to look forward to the final
850973 hes going to win his share of the ball and that takes a lot of pressure off me hes better than me at doing that so i try to play off of him hopefully we can keep scoring goals
850974 he looks better i think he left and went to some soccer camp and came back hes a different player hes bigger stronger and a little bit more powerful i think he himself has brought that swagger back to our team we needed a bit of a jump and he provided that to us
850975 you know rogers ekpo there were a lot of guys missing tonight i think what hurt us the most actually was losing marshall and losing evans to injuries that dictates what you can do tactically then you cant make some changes that we want to make we wanted to bring ezra in during the game as an outside back so we could get some attacking from him obviously we couldnt make that change anymore then with evans he was a guy we thought could go 90 minutes for us tonight then we could make some other changes offensively
850976 in fairness to houston good teams finish those opportunities thats what makes good players and thats what makes good teams thats something where were in our adolescence thats what i keep telling our team you look at houston theres like eight guys that have played together now for the last four or five years as a unit and that makes a big difference were still a team thats getting to that point weve got to be a little more cold blooded and that will happen as we mature
850977 theres no shame in coming here and losing obviously this is a quality side the discouraging thing is that at times we had our chances to score some goals we were dangerous enough to score some goals we didnt take advantage of the opportunities you create and you get punished in the back youre going to lose
850978 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
850979 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
850980 the members have either climbed the himalayas or have gone through some hard training
850981 if you find me short in things impute that to my love of brevity if you find me besides the truth in anything impute that to my infirmity but if you find anything here that serves to your furtherance and joy of the faith impute that to the mercy of god bestowed on you and me yours to serve you with what little i have
850982 in the cross of christ as in a splendid theater the incomparable goodness of god is set before the whole world the glory of god shines indeed in all creatures on high and below but never more brightly than in the cross in which there was a wonderful change of things the condemnation of all men was manifested sin blotted out salvation restored to men in short the whole world was renewed and all things restored to order
850983 young womens breasts are dense and if they get mammograms their breasts show up very white on mammograms and cancer shows up as white
850984 but as women get older their breasts are less dense and show up gray on a mammogram which makes it easy to identify the white cancer if there is a family history and women are worried they can start earlier and in this case a digital mammography may work better than a traditional mammography
850985 in fact most of the women who get mastectomies dont need them
850986 and for women to lose their breasts in addition to the normal emotional turmoil that they go through having breast cancer is harmful emotionally and physically
850987 women with early stage breast cancer usually do not need a mastectomy and will benefit from chemotherapy almost always
850988 women who get a lumpectomy will need radiation and thats the difference women who get a mastectomy will not need radiation but with a lumpectomy you always need radiation
850989 breast cancer in women younger than 30 is so rare and this is one of the things that concerns me
850990 i think the media focuses on young women because its so shocking when someone in their 20s gets cancer but what you end up with are women in their 20s and 30s who are terrified that theyre going to get cancer and women in their 50s who think they dont need to worry about it when the opposite is true
850991 its still a significant number but when you compare it to the overall number of women who get breast cancer its a small percentage
850992 what makes it fatal is if it goes into other parts of the body and gets into the lymph nodes lungs and other organs
850993 also if it gets into the blood or the bones it can kill a person thats the risk of metastasized cancer that means it has spread and once it hits the lymph nodes it can become out of control
850994 the collingwood football club is not only embarrassed by the situation we are absolutely furious
850995 there is no excuse were sick and tired of of this sort of behaviour from players
850996 coach mick malthouse gets belted week in week out as the coach and its time that these guys grew up and took responsibility for their actions
850997 i think the message has got through to lots and lots of players we havent had an incident this year that i can think of
850998 when you are talking four weeks out from finals i am sure anyone from the collingwood football club would be extremely disappointed this morning
850999 asciano continues to assess a range of options and consider a range of factors in determining the optimum financing strategy for future growth
851000 there is no other explanation asciano has for the price change in asciano securities
851001 i shall tell you we have killed him you and i we are his murderers but how have we done this how were we able to drink up the sea who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon what did we do when we unchained the earth from its sun whither is it moving now whither are we moving now away from all suns are we not perpetually falling backward sideward forward in all directions is there any up or down left are we not straying as through an infinite nothing do we not feel the breath of empty space has it not become colder is it not more and more night coming on all the time must not lanterns be lit in the morning do we not hear anything yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying god do we not smell anything yet of gods decomposition gods too decompose god is dead god remains dead and we have killed him how shall we murderers of all murderers console ourselves that which was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us with what water could we purify ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we need to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it there has never been a greater deed and whosoever shall be born after us for the sake of this deed he shall be part of a higher history than all history hitherto
851002 kalau ada ayah suapan pertama hendaklah dimulakan oleh ayah kalau tidak ada ayah emak dulu rahsia di sebaliknya bila dikekalkan begitu selama tiga bulan akan tumbuh di hati anak rasa hormat kepada yang lebih tua walaupun di luar pandangan kita jadi kalau kita hendak tahu macam mana anak kita di luar pandangan kita tengok waktu makan
851003 anak kita tidak akan sanggup untuk memasukkan makanan ke mulut atau memegang sesuatu yang bukan haknya yang biasa dia ambil masuk ke mulut dengan nama allah dan biasa memegang yang halal dengan tangan kanan melalui amalan yang mudah ini roh kita dimonitor oleh syariat amalan ini tak perlu pada tenaga dan wang ringgit yang banyak tapi perlu pada kesabaran dan istiqamah
851004 bagi cubitan lauk yang pertama ambil yang paling dekat kenapa
851005 kalau ayah atau ibu hendak membina sifat penyayang ambil lauk yang pertama letak di pinggan anak memang anak akan rasa lain kalau dia tak mahu lauk itu tak mengapa tapi kita memberi tu yang mustahak kalau kita buat macam itu dia juga akan jadi macam itu pada orang lain kita sudah bina masyarakat penyayang di dalam rumah kita malah untuk latih anak cinta pada saudaranya yang lain itulah waktunya
851006 bila ambil makanan untuk suap ke mulut jangan diangkat suapan seterusnya selagi di dalam mulut itu belum ditelan sesudah ditelan baru angkat suapan seterusnya masuk ke mulut untuk apa melatih jangan tamak dan bersifat qanaah mencukupi apa yang ada atau lebih tepat melatih syukur terhadap apa yang allah kurniakan
851007 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
851008 those who once made a fortune from adsense and the losers who never did
851009 as i thought we got ourselves a gen u wine adsense loser
851010 i betcha tweaked fiddled adjusted and trimmed till your fingers were raw to the bone but you never made more than nickel and cents aint that right loser
851011 is there really any truth to the rumors that where you place those google adsense ads can actually improve response
851012 to give away a goal like we did late in the game and to react the way they did just makes me incredibly proud to be leading this group but also to feel like i am part of this group
851013 i think this group is just going to continue to move forward and continue to get better
851014 again its another game where we felt we had something and then poor defending shoots ourselves in the foot it seems to be the story of our life at the moment especially on the road
851015 i think the team is coming along like we want it to we played well on the road the last few games and weve done what we needed to do here at home
851016 going on this break were definitely confident in our game and when we get back were going to get back to working hard
851017 i picked a couple of new ideas lets hope i can now surf ha ha
851018 content is very useful and great to have a local product
851019 some people put these huge prices out for the publicity and that publicity gets them buyers and then it goes for 30 percent less
851020 theres cachet in being the owner of the most expensive apartment
851021 what theyre not telling anybody is what theyre willing to take
851022 when youre dealing with such a rare commodity just like a piece of art the comps dont exist in the global market the price is in line
851023 if theyre good candidates and will have no problem getting a mortgage you cant let them go
851024 when we were first looking last year sales offices were packed
851025 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
851026 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
851027 my prime minister went to annapolis and all we got is this lousy tee shirt
851028 airplane mode is not powered off thats airplane mode you have to turn the power off until 10 minutes into the flight

851033 irenke be embracin de shadow but de spirits dey be sayin dat this be sumtin she can do
851034 yes i crawled out of the grave wearing these robes thank you very much
851035 you find a lot of rehashed titles the gaming experience is poor and its hard to discover the games
851036 we want to be the definitive publisher of games for the iphone we think there is a tremendous opportunity
851037 you have a ds and you have a telephone why not buy just one
851038 the iphone has excellent hardware in it it is as capable as the ds or psp
851039 the games that you currently have are very appealing but that doesnt last for long
851040 a lot of people still have an affinity for john mccain
851041 they voted for him once and he might be able to take advantage of that
851042 some jobs that have left michigan are not coming back
851043 are really moderate republicans theyre pro choice their hairstylists are gay they dont get worked up about teaching evolution
851044 obama will have to go in himself and build his own machine
851045 i welcome the growing consensus in the united states and iraq for a timeline
851046 i dont want to make promises not knowing what the situation is on the ground
851047 i cannot conceive of a more disastrous president than one who did not change his policy positions to reflect changes in reality
851048 it would not be a blessing for the american people to have a president who kept every campaign promise it would be a curse
851049 i cannot in good conscience support this escalation it is a policy which has already been tried and a policy which has failed
851050 i will drastically reduce our presence there i believe we should have all of our troops out by 2013 but i dont want to make promises not knowing what the situations going to be three or four years out
851051 i have consistently said that as a consequence of us putting more troops in and the awakening in the anbar province where sunnis turned against al qaeda violence is significantly down and that there is a significant improvement in iraq but what i have also consistently said is that moving forward what we have to focus on is the need for political reconciliation thats whats going to make the ultimate difference
851052 we need troops in the numbers required to do the job in place for as long as it takes to complete their mission it would be far better to have too many reinforcements in iraq than to suffer once again the tragic results in insufficient force levels
851053 timetables was the buzzword for those that wanted to get out
851054 i really feel like i enjoy swimming now more than i ever have i enjoy competing more than i ever have
851055 i had literally just breast fed my daughter got on the blocks and got ready to swim
851056 i didnt know what to expect so i was pleasantly surprised
851057 i couldnt count the number of people who came up to me at that meet and said it would be great to see someone our age at the olympics
851058 whos going to believe me if im just getting a urine test
851059 she showed up without a lawyer without an agent without a coach
851060 and withstood probably the worst cross examination of any of the other athletes
851061 the science is not at the stage where we can give a 100 guarantee to any athlete that they are clean
851062 but if they arent clean then they would have to be a fool or a huge risk taker to do a program like this
851063 the guy who invented them is great friends with my coach who is also german
851064 after talking to him and learning more about them why not take a product where you know the person who made it and know exactly what is in the product why take a chance with something on the market where you dont know if its tainted or not
851065 because it helps my recovery and its not illegal so why not
851066 so in the water its not about power but more about making my stroke more efficient
851067 i decided to become an open book and asked to be tested in any way they want to show im clean
851068 i understand if i just sat there and said i passed my tests that people wouldnt believe me ive gone beyond the call of duty to prove im clean but you are guilty until proven innocent in this day and age so what else can i do its a real bummer
851069 i feel like i have so many middle aged women who look up to me i want them to feel proud and feel like they can do what they set out to do
851070 we have been pulling out our staff on a gradual basis anyway in preparation for a prolonging of this dispute
851071 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mount kumgang and the area under military control from now on
851072 the members have either climbed the himalayas or have gone through some hard training
851073 zimbabweans are looking at the current talks with cautious optimism they are very weary of the likely outcome from these negotiations as you are aware in 1987 there were negotiations between the zanu pf and zapu zimbabwe african peoples union and the negotiations came up with a unity agreement that basically failed to address the core issues basically the agreement led to the annihilation of the opposition in matabeleland
851074 zimbabweans are quite weary that for the mdc to go and negotiate with the zanu pf such a scenario like the previous talks might come out of those negotiations the second thing is that zimbabweans are quite cognizant that whatever negotiations take place their will or their decision in march 29 is non negotiable which means that the decision that they made that the mdc is the government they would want to be in place needs to be respected in any negotiation process
851075 the fact that the sadc southern african development community and the au african union are monitoring the peace process does not give zimbabweans confidence based on the fact that the two bodies have had their credibility eroded to a large extent the aus acceptance of robert mugabe to go to the au summit after the african union and pan african parliament and sadc had all declared that the election in june were not an expression of the free will of the people of zimbabwe was an indictment on the au it was a sign that the au body is complicit with mugabe in terms of subverting the will of the people of zimbabwe
851076 so there is some hesitance on the part of zimbabweans to say there is no guarantee that the au will protect their vote more importantly that it was exacerbated by the resolutions that came out advocating for a government of national unity
851077 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
851078 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
851079 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
851080 they have a lot of very big challenges but one of the things is working with the other institutions including the army and the intelligence service
851081 they need to get everybody lined up in the same direction if they are going to tackle the terrorist problem
851082 the speech will be a formality about the u s engagement with asia especially on security and economic engagement
851083 america has three key words promote democracy security and the economy in asia protocol wise he cannot declare any significant policies since this is his last speech
851084 stop interfering in chinas internal affairs under the pretext of human rights and religious issues and avoid damage to china u s relations
851085 despite my claims that i had given up online dating for good i currently have a crush on another stupid internetboy probably i shouldnt email him because probably he is a douche but probably i will email him and probably it will end badly resulting in new material for the fashionable young ladies book of letters
851086 taking into consideration the market scenario and the advice of the merchant bankers to defer the issue
851087 we can jump back straight to the promised land we can live like poets and i can write in your hand we can live to tell it all
851088 be content with what you have and may you find serenity and tranquillity in a world that you may not understand
851089 the highest national interest is the eu membership and we will not give it up but this does not mean that the government will agree to any blackmail
851090 if someone thinks that this pro european government will give up on defending national interests for the sake of european perspectives they are wrong
851091 the shebab young boys were looking for a place to escape to because they were stuck between the fence and barbed wire
851092 meanwhile the jeep was getting closer and closer we started running away but the younger children couldnt run as fast they were still near the fence then the driver of the jeep got out and shot three live bullets we heard the bullets and then we saw a young boy on the ground
851093 i said dont go you are young he said no im going just give me the onions
851094 present their ideas in front of an audience of creators evangelists and adopters of cutting edge technologies who will provide feedback in real time and decide the winner
851095 if google really wanted to deliver a knockout punch to microsoft it would integrate openoffice with google docs
851096 and while jruby and groovy will probably spend the next few months one upping each other weve both proven something far more important the jvm is an excellent platform for dynamic languages dont let anyone tell you its not

851220 last week i spent some time with dennis varganyi country manager canada a guy with a long term experience in web analytics who showed me what xiti has to offer

851224 the basic premise of measurement is that you want to measure something so you can improve it
851225 its not about the numbers its about the story you can tell about them
851226 continuously formed and reformed through our everyday interactions and experiences in turn this affects the way in which we continue to interact and make sense of our ongoing experiences it also gives us our sense of identity our perceived place in the world and so on in other words identity is socially constructed and relational in nature it does not exist separately from the roles that we each play or from the diverse relationships that we are each part of
851227 this conception of the self as emerging in the social process which is the interaction of selves is very different to the notion of the autonomous individual or indeed any notion of an innate self instead of being given by inheritance or given in any other way selves are formed in social interaction at the same time as they form this interaction this paradox of forming and being formed by is thus at the heart of the emergence of self and society both the self and the social are the same process with the only distinction being that the former is a private role play or silent conversation while the latter is a public game and vocal communication

851237 the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes
851238 essentially a time machine which synchronizes into one present a great number of divergent time spans
851239 still tends towards the making of plans for something we will decide to do in the future this may be a very entertaining exercise but it is a futile one
851240 the question is not what we should do tomorrow it is what do we have to do today my emphasis to be ready for an uncertain tomorrow the question is not what will happen in the future it is what futurity do we have to factor into our present thinking and doing what time spans do we have to consider and how do we converge them into a simultaneous decision in the present
851241 we can make decisions only in the present the rest are pious intentions and yet we cannot make decisions for the present alone the most expedient most opportunist decision let alone the decision not to decide may commit us on a long range basis if not permanently and irrevocably
851242 the past is not factually given because it is reconstructed in the present as the basis for action to be taken in the present the past is what we re member the future is also in the present in the form of anticipation and expectation it too forms the basis of action in the present furthermore what we are anticipating affects what we remember and what we remember affects what we expect in a circular fashion in this way the movement of the living present is experience having a circular time structure that arises simply because humans have the capacity for knowing what they are doing
851243 the future as expectation and anticipation is in the detail of actual interactions taking place now as is the past as reconstructions in this process of memory
851244 any attempt to do so is foolish human beings can neither predict nor control the future
851245 all managers are active participants with each other in the interactive processes that are the organisation the emphasis shifts from the manager focusing on how to make a choice in and about the future to focusing on the quality of participation in self organising conversations from which such choices and the responses to them emerge in the living present

851333 kami harus mencari properti untuk pemotretan dengan tema pedesaan saya harus cari topi caping dan kaus oblong kaus oblongnya pun harus merek tertentu soalnya warnanya lebih kena
851334 dulu rumah orangtua saya dekat sawah jadi saya malah serasa kembali ke masa kecil beda dengan indy yang besar di jakarta
851335 kami sudah siap sejak sebelum matahari terbit kata orang orang di sana tidak setiap saat matahari muncul kami termasuk beruntung karena akhirnya matahari nongol bagus banget
851336 waktu itu kami memang ingin foto foto pre wedding dengan konsep pantai setelah berdiskusi akhirnya pilihan jatuh ke pulau bidadari soalnya dekat cuma 30 menit dari ancol
851337 waktu itu cuaca sedang tidak menentu pokoknya tidak mendukung untuk menyeberang ke pulau bidadari ombak masih tinggi
851338 takut juga sih tapi mbak lili rajin mengontak pihak pulau bidadari untuk mengetahui apakah cuaca sudah memungkinkan kita berangkat ke sana

851609 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
851610 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
851611 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
851612 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
851613 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
851614 i have the highest regard for him as person sportsman and leader it is a great loss for world cricket
851615 its extremely disappointing its disappointing for the collingwood football club
851616 its disappointing for heath shaw given he is a senior player at the club
851617 when youre talking about this four weeks out from finals im sure anyone associated with the collingwood football club would be extremely disappointed
851618 anybody in society it doesnt matter if it is heath shaw anybody who continues to drink and drive is stupid
851619 thats the message that the state government all state governments around the country and the federal government are saying
851620 theres millions and millions of us dollars spent on public awareness to educate people about drink driving
851621 there are still people on weekends and nights who are still getting caught drink driving and whats disappointing about all that is it not only puts themselves at risk but others at risk
851622 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine
851623 the only sign i saw of her was of somebody being pretty positive about life
851624 its hard dealing with something thats happened 15 months ago
851625 i find it hard to believe shes just gone off on a jaunt
851626 if she is out there the further effort will locate her
851627 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
851628 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
851629 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
851630 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
851631 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
851632 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
851633 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
851634 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
851635 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
851636 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today
851637 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
851638 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
851639 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
851640 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
851641 i played a bit more aggressive and served a little bit smarter than i had in the past and obviously it worked
851642 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
851643 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
851644 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
851645 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
851646 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
851647 using force is ugly but if you dont do that youll have a violent felon running around
851648 we do things people in an office or store or hospital dont have to do
851649 at this stage hell play the season out unless he believes he cant contribute
851650 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
851651 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
851652 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
851653 hes probably been under pressure more so this year than ever before with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
851654 the defence has been under more pressure than ever so i think those two things combined have probably put darren under a lot of pressure and its probably showing his injury to be worse than it probably is
851655 it was less efficient than having the planes electronic transmission locator working but more efficient than not having any information
851656 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff
851657 as far as what happened we cant say we have no idea at this point why
851658 the problem is not that some costs will rise but that at the moment there is no discussion of the need to compensate the state and territory governments
851659 nearly one and a half billion us dollars per year could employ more than 15 000 teachers or nurses
851660 the commonwealth has said that it will compensate households and polluters but it looks to us as though the state governments have got a much stronger case for compensation than the big emitters
851661 unless the commonwealth puts compensating the states ahead of compensating the polluters then those who rely most heavily on government services will miss out the most
851662 that reflects a concern in the community in australia for us to act
851663 but i also would say to you that i think at the moment that just as many australians are yet to fully understand what an emissions trading scheme actually is how it operates and what its going to do
851664 i respect the view in the community that people are concerned about climate change they want australia to act but i equally think its fair to say that most australians in fact an equal proportion still dont understand that its going to mean a tax that will wash through every part of australian life every household every small business
851665 people have got to understand exactly what we are going into an emissions trading scheme is in plain language a tax t a x
851666 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
851667 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
851668 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
851669 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
851670 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
851671 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020
851672 ive started taking fewer trips out to see him but i stay for longer periods of time
851673 and when he comes here next month hell be here for 10 11 days
851674 spending more time together on each visit means we spend time as a couple not as two people who are dating
851675 if airfares were still low i probably would still be making lots of short trips

851694 how does this passage reveal more clearly the overall theme of the bible

851697 is part of our effort to shine a stronger spotlight on an area with important financial and managerial implications for every level of government in new york state
851698 personnel costs are a major element in new yorks sky high taxes yet new yorkers are often unaware of important developments on the government labor relations front
851699 the goal of the payroll watch website is to inform the public by illuminating the issue
851700 im rich but im not going to brag about it
851701 la coyuntura es id nea para que haya reacomodo de los congresistas en determinadas bancadas pero en eso seremos bastante selectivos no queremos incorporar a algunos topos
851702 podemos luchar por el scudetto solo el inter y el milan son m s fuertes
851703 esta escuadra se ha reforzado hay jugadores muy buenos debemos trabajar con humildad y llegaremos alto en un campeonato con tantos equipos fuertes adem s del inter y el milan somos todos iguales la roma equipo contra el que debutar en la serie a es fuerte en italia pero nosotros somos j venes y podemos hacerlo bien depende de nosotros he encontrado jugadores importantes pero debemos trabajar mucho
851704 quiero jugar no s qu decidir el t cnico esta semana entrenar luego veremos el slavia praga es un equipo muy fuerte al que respeto y contra el que har lo mejor posible si juego
851705 im going to beijing at a time thats historic and this is an extreme experience
851706 he cant stop talking about food he lives to create food and to eat it
851707 he is super talented and has a great palate and keen eye which makes him the perfect candidate for catering
851708 theyll put 20 different flavors on something and you eat it and have no idea what youre eating it drives me insane
851709 i hope this will be the most amazing experience of my life
851710 ive had several conversations with al about this in the past weeks
851711 make no mistake about it the dolan family does not want murdoch or zuckerman staking out camp in melville
851712 he doesnt want to drag this out after all he and rupert have already reached an agreement in principle for newsday
851713 already the owner of the vigorous new york post murdoch could bring decades of newspaper experience to bear together with the ability to create a joint operating agreement between the two paper
851714 exploring large scale renewable projects but i need to balance those desires with the economic impacts such projects would have on our ratepayers
851715 we are going to develop a comprehensive vision plan that would make sense from an environmental housing and economic development perspective
851716 by taking this comprehensive approach we can get more people on board
851717 in the past we looked at that station as an attractor for customers
851718 this would be the one place on long island that would have a north south mass transit connection
851719 we will be studying whether to have a dedicated lane for the buses and studying the cost
851720 the real beauty of this project is that it is not one of these sprawling developments where we would need to bankrupt ourselves to buy gas getting there
851721 as oil prices continue to climb such developments are all the more important
851722 once we develop a bioscience cluster it will spill over into the general business community along the route 110 corridor and we will need housing for them
851723 were going to get one affordable housing bill passed and were going to move the process forward
851724 this has to happen before any other progress is made on workforce housing on long island
851725 you have in place a bipartisan consensus that this problem is real and it needs to be solved urgently
851726 the concern is that this will perpetuate patterns of racial and class housing segregation
851727 wealthier villages could get around the law by negotiating a deal with less wealthy villages to literally sell off their housing obligation there are quite a few loopholes
851728 the inclusionary bill is a good symbolic message but would ultimately only get you about 100 to 200 units a year being built
851729 were going to get one passed and were going to move the process forward
851730 without opportunity to be heard and without any semblance of due process the office of the new york state comptroller has unilaterally determined that my 36 years of continuous tier 1 membership in the new york state employees retirement system is to be rescinded on grounds contrary to the new york state constitution and the comptrollers very own regulations
851731 contractual relationship the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired
851732 this is wrong as to me and wrong as to others
851733 therefore i am going forward with the lawsuit the constitution is very clear
851734 these two particular individuals swergold and evola were pointed out in an audit of this office in 2005 so we followed up to see if corrective action had been taken as the audit recommended and it had not
851735 we are convinced that bill cullen did nothing wrong and was fully entitled to service credit in the retirement system
851736 had a myriad of duties and responsibilities with each of these entities
851737 we would like to see a meshing of that project with our community
851738 we want transportation in and out available for people who work and live in uniondale too we want uniondale businesses to be helped not replaced
851739 high gas prices have a negative multiplier effect driving up the cost of everyday goods
851740 the fastest way to put the brakes on rising fuel food and other commodity costs is by instituting a much needed holiday from the state fuel taxes for motorists and businesses
851741 republicans are trying to hide from the failures of the bush administration
851742 i believe that oil companies will simply raise their prices to eliminate any cost savings
851743 is a convicted felon entitled to greater protection than nat swergold
851744 bill cullen is fully entitled to the service credits and we will be fighting this
851745 the state would be enhancing inequities between wealthy and poor schools by not having a cap
851746 we should be looking more seriously at a circuit breaker which will help the people who need tax relief the most
851747 a circuit breaker protects taxpayers from a property tax overload just like an electric circuit breaker by essentially capping an individual households property taxes as a percentage of their income
851748 a circuit breaker doesnt get to the core problem of controlling local spending its not a solution
851749 but it depends on whats going on there it has to really be extreme circumstances
851750 the community was very nervous about what will happen with the motel such as section 8 coming in
851751 and we also wanted to make sure that they were removing all the homeless
851752 we felt that from our vantage point it was a very positive and productive meeting
851753 i believe the meeting was called because of the future use of the motor inn
851754 there were rumblings that we would turn it into a homeless shelter even though we never had any intentions of doing that
851755 i believe social services is doing its best to get them out of the motel i feel that social services is telling the truth taking the correct measures to put homeless people in the safest and most positive environment something a motel is not
851756 it has a bad reputation for a history of drugs sex and violence
851757 but it depends on whats going on there it has to really be extreme circumstances
851758 we hope that whatever happens there is something that the people in the community can live with
851759 were hearing that the place has been a problem for a long time
851760 meanwhile the owner is trying to make a living but when you hear about the motel it tends to be about drugs or violence or something very negative and the neighbors want it shut down
851761 if a number of crimes are committed there and if that is in fact the reality we have to take measures to stop it one should not live with that in their backyard
851762 a lot of island park people are really coming together
851763 we want our community back and our quality of life back and this is a start
851764 music fell by the largest margin 5 5 to 125 million from 132 million in 2006
851765 i appreciate that you may cherish a different kind of music purchasing experience but i just want to get my record out to a mass audience with as much marketing and as cheaply to you the fan as possible i care less about your music buying experience than in your buying my music experience wal mart delivers the best value to you on that front
851766 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance

851773 some individuals are more sensitive to bites so they notice them more
851774 some people produce more cues than others they give off more carbon dioxide anyone who is really active or has a naturally high metabolism its more than carbon dioxide though or mosquitoes would waste a lot of time chasing cars
851775 the overall message is that people should not underestimate mosquitoes

851790 god understood theistically is no longer operative in our belief systems no matter how hard we try to hold on to this premodern deity
851791 that they were reduced to a sense of themselves as almost totally insignificant
851792 to get to heaven where god dwelt one simply had to rise as jesus did in the ascension story into the sky but when copernicus and galileo challenged the accuracy of the three tiered universe they rendered this possibility null and void
851793 the reality of the god experience overwhelms me every day of my life

851822 i have been doing the yummy mummy turbulence training 4 week fitness routine and it is wonderful i havent had this much energy since way before i had my two children after i had them i gained about 10 extra pounds that i couldnt seem to shake i have tried many other exercise routines but they never yeilded any real results since i started this work out which is really quick and easy to do even with a 2 year old and a 4 year old i feel great and after only 3 weeks i have to say i look great my whole body is toned my stomach is flatter than it was when i got married 8 years ago my love handles have mysteriously melted away my husband cant keep his hands off i will definately be recommending this to all my mommy friends thanks again for helping me get my body back if i knew it was going to be this easy i would have started a long time ago
851823 dear craig so i did join your tt lifestyle and am very glad that i did i learn a lot from it started with great success to do my shopping only on perimeters of all stores eat mostly row and fresh veggies and fruits i am so glad on your point of view on eating fresh fruits i started with intermediate workout and already see results beside loosing 7 lbs i also lost one inch from my chest and hips and two inches from my waist i think its just great i missed last tt transformation contest but will keep an eye on maybe next one i also really enjoy your support on line your newsletters and pictures of your cute dog and your abs i need to mention to you that i am not a youngster i am 61 years young quite fit and happy with positive outlook on life so your program is just great for me thank you for your great motivation
851824 i have been using turbulence training for about 3 months now and am ecstatic with the results as a full time graduate student i spend long hours in the lab and many of those hours involve stationary work and sitting hunched over a desk at a computer i was in a rut physically and needed something to get me back in shape and give me some more energy luckily in my off hours i researched fat loss methods i stumbled across craigs tt program which was exactly what i was looking for short yet very effective workouts that can fit into anyones schedule based on methods proven in scientific studies can be useful to anyone regardless of fitness level as craig says if the workouts dont seem hard enough than you are probably not using enough weight but you can even start at the bodyweight level if you have not worked out in awhile plus the workouts require minimal equipment you get great nutrition information and you get access to the online forum which is invaluable being able to actually communicate on almost a daily basis with the person who created the program is one of the best parts of tt click here for the tt forum and there are plenty of other people on the site with tons of useful information who may have gone through similar experiences since starting the tt program i have dropped 15 lbs more than 5 bodyfat and over 3 from my waist i feel great and my energy levels are through the roof i even feel this extra energy spilling over into other aspects of my life and making them better as well all i can say is thanks cb not just for the fitness change but a great lifestyle change
851825 it was dec 31 2007 and i saw in the mirror the effects of holiday indulgences on my waistline i wasnt significantly overweight compared to the average american which is not a standard to be proud of but i was at an all time high weight for me of 169 pounds on a 5 foot 6 inch frame i subscribe to mens health magazine where i noticed the belly off program designed by craig i signed up that day my goals were 1 a waist to hip ratio of 0 92 2 a body mass index of 25 and 3 body fat of 12 percent bodyweight 500 belly off program and was astonished at the results in all my years of regular exercise ive never experienced a change in fitness like this i lost 11 pounds in eight weeks most of the weight was shed from my mid section which is just what i wanted my arms and chest became better defined and i started to see abs on a 47 year old guy i was psyched to continue the progress since completing the belly off program ive continued with the diet and ive used workouts from craigs turbulence training program changing the routines every month im now down to 152 pounds for a total weight loss of 17 pounds and have achieved my body mass index goal i lost 3 5 inches on my waist and 2 75 inches in my hips im not quite at my waist to hip ratio goal but thats okay because ive lost inches in my hips i dont have a reliable measure of my body fat percent but my pants are loose enough to satisfy me that ive made great progress there too i cant believe how successful craigs programs has been for me its the best decision ive made for my fitness since i committed to regular exercise two decades ago thanks craig

852175 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
852176 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
852177 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
852178 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
852179 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things

852330 the psalms can and should be part of the constant practice of the presence of god regularly read from beginning to end they lead us again and again to consider aspects of life and of gods will that we might not otherwise choose to remember or confront let alone to embody in our living memorized in chunks the psalms can provide ready response to the pressing realities of our days when i have wakened in a panic in the darkness of the early morning hours submerged in fear self pity or self doubt the psalms have often provided the assurance that my anxieties are known by god who enlightens my dark places so i encourage you to make the psalms your constant companion keep a copy at hand and keep their words in your mind and heart and on your lips as you meet the challenges of your days and nights

852541 hes doing a great job in dallas and im sure he would come in here and do a good job
852542 hes passionate about winning thats his main concern putting a winning product out there plus hes a lot of fun he really gets into it hes not just a guy who throws his money in and is hands off hes hands on and involved so i think it would be a lot of fun
852543 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
852544 although i hadnt won i was confident i was going to win
852545 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
852546 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
852547 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
852548 i said just cozy it down there if it goes in fine dont leave yourself a 4 footer and i left myself a 4 footer
852549 ive been practicing 4 and 5 footers all week last week and at the end of the day it pays off
852550 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
852551 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
852552 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
852553 it puts me in a really good frame of mind going into next week and the rest of the season
852554 it is one of the most popular sites in the state department other than getting your pay information
852555 there are plenty of ways to commit career suicide wikis are just the newest one
852556 people will say i have something i want to post i want to check before i do it and we say no no put it up

852560 when you go to google youll end up with a lot of search results and you need to sieve through them
852561 itll be good to have something that gets you what you need
852562 there are a lot of resources out there but there has to be quality control
852563 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
852564 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
852565 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
852566 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
852567 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher
852568 we talk a lot about remedial and enrichment work and it takes a lot of time not only for the teacher but also for students
852569 digitalisation is changing the way students learn and we have to accept that
852570 i guess well only know how much easier when it comes into use
852571 with that protective barrier removed out of state same sex couples who marry here will sue to seek recognition in their home states creating a flood of costly lawsuits and further eroding the peoples right to define marriage democratically
852572 it also puts so called gay divorce in question as same sex couples face a legal limbo when seeking to dissolve their massachusetts marriages in their home states which have not recognized them
852573 this is a clarion call to the rest of the nation about the dangers of this radical social experiment coming out of massachusetts and the audacity of this state to try to mandate this to the other 48 states
852574 it substantiates the urgent need for a federal marriage amendment the other states need to see that what is happening in massachusetts will come upon them unless they take action
852575 massachusetts legislators voted to abolish a ban on interracial marriage in 1843 a full 70 years before the 1913 law was written
852576 race was not a factor if it were i would support this repeal
852577 no marriage shall be contracted in this commonwealth by a party residing and intending to continue to reside in another jurisdiction if such marriage would be void if contracted in such other jurisdiction and every marriage contracted in this commonwealth in violation hereof shall be null and void

852579 i will shake all nations and the desired of all nations will come and i will fill this house with glory says the lord almighty the silver is mine and the gold is mine declares the lord almighty the glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house says the lord almighty and in this place i will grant peace declares the lord almighty
852580 if we have not silver and gold we must honour him with such as we have and he will accept us

852587 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
852588 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
852589 there were rumours of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
852590 we need more medicines and blood but we are trying to do our best with what we have
852591 there were too many rumours we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand

852597 that was some of the best basketball ive ever seen in my lifetime

852630 once upon a time i had to deal with a company who sell flash charting components their component had a bug that i needed fixing so i emailed them about it asking when itd be fixed
852631 i could learn flash and actionscript and write my own charting component release it as open source host it on sourceforge and build up a community of helpful coders faster than they can fix a single bug

852633 this one of the core reasons why most dashboards are crappy i e they are data pukes that provide little in terms of context and even less in terms of actionable value
852634 the best way to condense a broad spectrum of information to fit onto a dashboard is in the form of summaries and exceptions given the purpose of a dashboard to help people monitor whats going on much of the information it presents is necessary only when something unusual is happening something that falls outside the realm of normality into the realm of problems and opportunities why make someone wade through hundreds of values when only one or two require attention we call these critical values exceptions

852638 the only reason did i mention only to use a chart in a presentation is to make a point if you want to prove some deep insight or give people textured data to draw their own conclusions dont put it in a presentation
852639 if the facts demand nuance dont use a graph because you wont get nuance youll get confusion
852640 i think tufte is completely out of his gourd and totally wrong i think this is one of the worst graphs ever made to make me take 15 minutes to study it doesnt make sense
852641 is that they should either be line area charts when graphing a change over time like unemployment rates or they should be a simple pie chart
852642 i stepped on the toes of many data presentation purists 2 yesterday so let me reiterate my point to make it crystal clear in a presentation to non scientists or to bored scientists the purpose of a chart or graph is to make one point vividly tell a story and move on if you cant be both vivid and truthful it doesnt belong in your presentation
852643 in a presentation to non scientists or to bored scientists the purpose of a chart or graph is to make one point vividly

852646 there was no shortage of warnings about the electrical dangers in iraq just a shortage of will to do right by our troops
852647 i came on so quickly there was no time for any of us to prepare for it to spend the money for the trip to athens i had my teammates and i talked to my parents on the phone every day but the story sounded like i was all alone and it almost turned people against my parents when they had done nothing wrong
852648 it made it seem like we had abandoned our child a lot of people misunderstood
852649 there werent a lot of positives about the last olympics for katie except it being part of a maturing process for her
852650 my confidence was pretty down after the olympics and i wanted to prove to myself and the world i wasnt a one hit wonder it was a turning point in my career
852651 by the 2004 olympics i had coached her about 740 days and one day out of those 740 she wasnt herself
852652 i had no doubt she was going to do real well in her next big meet katie is a stud
852653 michael cleared the way for swimmers to do multiple events at major international meets
852654 five or six years ago it would gave seemed ridiculous to try it
852655 not because of my own nostalgic feelings for the program but because i feel it is still such a special nurturing voice in the lives of children
852656 it was mister rogers who taught me how to begin to deal with my feelings i think he taught my parents a lot too i know im still learning from him
852657 a sophistical rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity
852658 freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved all are not free
852659 the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands
852660 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
852661 he better run harder than he ran today at the goal line
852662 im sure they were he has to run harder not over analyze understand what that drills about its about hitting downhill and hopefully next time out hell be better
852663 i think i was more concerned with running the play instead of getting into the end zone i was trying to read the blocks and get in there but theres so much going on and coming so fast you just have to get in there
852664 everybody out heres a beast theyre so athletic and everybodys a competitor
852665 i dont think you find too many college guys looking like that
852666 i only had two touchdowns last year so i really have to take heed of my opportunity there
852667 he gets his pads down and he finishes downhill thats one of his distinguishing characteristics he has value in that regard
852668 the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased
852669 she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me
852670 the grab the jerk and restrain the hold twist and turn the takedown and the tackle
852671 i think sometimes officials just get carried away with the play they get emotional about the game
852672 there were a couple last year that should have been called and they really came at a bad time
852673 when they explain holding to you on the field they always say youve got to fight to get off
852674 i dont think they miss it that much i think they just choose not to call it
852675 lets face it the games been turned into an offensive game they want to protect the quarterback and they dont want people like me running around out there killing him
852676 i dont think they get caught up in the game and stop watching what theyre supposed to be watching but i think games get to a certain point where everyone just kind of agrees like lets play
852677 they dont want to be the ones deciding the game and really the fans dont want them to decide the game so they just let you play
852678 but thats just not the way the players the fans or the officials want the game officiated
852679 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
852680 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
852681 the reason medical help and a helicopter showed up so quickly after the accident may be partly because dr mosesso provided an inside number to a helpful samaritan rescuer who called on a cell phone
852682 be fruitful and increase in number fill the earth and subdue it
852683 were just waiting on a piece of protective equipment and then we can march forward with him
852684 no question i can play but its on the head coach its his decision whenever he wants me to come back ill come back and be ready to go
852685 he and i met today and well continue to move forward but hes not where we want him yet
852686 no coach just said when he wants me to come back hell let me come back hey man i just work here man ill just do what they tell me to do and when he tells me to come back if its a day next week a month from now ill be ready to go
852687 practice i love to play football i love competing i love being out there but i dont think you can find too many linemen who like banging every day on two a days i think it does save me a little bit but from that standpoint the coaches i guess they want me to be out there
852688 i can run and do all these things defensive back drills
852689 but theres a difference between doing the drills and jogging and actually going out and competing
852690 i was able to do the conditioning test and all the running things but its tough to have the transition speed that really explosive speed
852691 it could be three days it could be a week
852692 you work hard in the offseason and something small like this happens its just something we have to deal with i tried to come back a couple days before and came back too early and aggravated it this time im taking a little more time off
852693 i told my kids im going to iraq to play army
852694 i felt like a piece of me had gone missing it was like i was split in two
852695 i was kind of stuck in a repetitive thinking about the suffering that she went through in the last month of her life and the last few weeks
852696 i just kept reliving that over and over again in my mind
852697 i think it has very important implications for how grief is conceptualized and how it is treated
852698 this shows that theres actually a difference in the brains of people who have the syndrome compared to the ones who dont
852699 some people are still confused by the fact that it does resemble regular grief
852700 i wanted to know if there is something different in the brain when people are processing their grief in those who are adapting well and those who are not adapting well
852701 the question was are their brains processing their grief differently
852702 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
852703 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
852704 even back in the old days there was a screening process for people who work in those laboratories
852705 there are time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
852706 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
852707 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
852708 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing

852713 the heart of an authentic america is less in the big picture or larger philosophies than in the specific sites of vivid human experience
852714 again i ask that we reconsider the historical sacagawea and give her credit for who she was for example although in popular culture she is celebrated as a guide we do not celebrate her greater genius which would seem to be her memory for landscapes her ability to translate between highly different languages and worldviews and her understanding of harvesting foods and moccasin reading in modern times she might have been an engineer or a crime scene investigator or a foreign correspondent with those skills in her world landmarks told stories and because of that they stayed fixed in her mind think of beaverhead rock she remembered those places because as a young child she would travel there with her people looking for bison and roots these travels were based on the seasons and the stories associated with the places they went the landmarks told stories and sacagawea must have been a very good listener
852715 she was a good and the best woman of the fort

852724 instructions take days to get to people and they get horribly distorted as theyre passed along
852725 in mature western societies life tends to be predictable and safe so you have to go to movies if you want to experience life with its full intensity drama and unpredictability but in asia normal life is like that life is like the movies

852727 you said it was idiotic to pay for bottled tap water mr smartypants columnist but you are wrong
852728 it is very very stupid but not idiotic what is idiotic is to pay for canned air
852729 he sprays canned air at his computer keyboard and it blows the dust into the air it swirls and then settles and then he sprays it again
852730 it is possible to purchase fresh devon welsh and mancunian varieties

852756 the state does not have the property tax to fall back on like the city does
852757 this cash cow could be in for a period of decline
852758 this is not the old crying wolf kind of stuff
852759 it is time for new york and other governments to cut up our credit cards the era of buy now and pay later and later is over

852769 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
852770 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
852771 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow

852777 and all the strings that tied you up are binding
852778 weve been talking about this for a couple of years because we knew the time would come when wed have to hang it up
852779 i took on the whole ball of wax that year
852780 its close and you dont have to drive very far to buy other stuff too
852781 they provided really nice service like if you had an emergency theyd open up for you
852782 it sure helps to have a wife like rose to go down there and run it for the time she did but it just got to be too much
852783 when you get called at night you go down there
852784 there was a year or two when it was tight and we had to dig into our savings
852785 but the rest of them have all been good years but owning your own business can be that way feast or famine
852786 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
852787 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
852788 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
852789 children who are abducted have experienced traumatic disruption and a loss of faith and sense of security in the adult world the world that is supposed to protect them
852790 the abduction of a child even by their own parent is a traumatic event because they are not expecting it the child feels that people who should be trusted cannot be trusted
852791 the child is definitely going to have trust issues and is going to remember the abduction for life
852792 they will certainly experience increased levels of anxiety and fearfulness in future they may also suffer sleeplessness
852793 if the child was expecting to visit the father and go home with the mother then fearfulness and mistrust of the father will occur
852794 shes a pretty well grounded little kid shes very bright much wiser than her years im not fearing for her emotional condition down the road
852795 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go
852796 you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
852797 i think hell talk a little bit about how much this election means to him and i think it will have a message about barack obama and about health care
852798 living in this dream world that he owned this yacht
852799 they said can we have agents come in here were doing a little stakeout
852800 i talked to a lot of guys who did that last year and they really enjoyed it and said that it benefited them
852801 so its something ill look into when the time approaches
852802 remember he hasnt even played a full season at triple a
852803 i feel like ive been here three weeks not three days
852804 there was a lot of tension coming into the trade deadline
852805 we didnt know what was going to happen so weve moved on and were moving forward
852806 the slider is one of my go to pitches and if i can have that slider i had out there today more consistently it would certainly make it a lot easier to pitch
852807 weve put names to men whove burned their fingerprints off to elude identification this suspect will be no different
852808 the case is far from over in many ways it has just begun
852809 the way he operates im sure he wouldve started a new life in high society circles and probably become an upstanding baltimore citzen
852810 hes been frequently in the baltimore delaware area for quite some time
852811 we handled it from the get go as if this childs life was in danger because we didnt know who he was and what hed done in the past
852812 thats one of the key things were working at is trying to find his true identity
852813 coming in here last year and not knowing what to expect i remember our kids walked off the field and it seemed like there were 5 000 people high fiving them and these kids felt like they were in the big leagues for the day
852814 last year we got here about halfway through the lowell game and we thought the stands were going to be about half full
852815 then we got in here and it was kind of a shock to see it sold out i think its great because it can give someone a taste of what its like to play here
852816 they sell out every game and they get into the game whether were winning by 10 runs or losing by 10 runs before i went there id never played before more than 1 500 so the futures game is going to top it all off i cant want to step out on the field and take batting practice because theres so much history i cant wait
852817 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base
852818 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
852819 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play
852820 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail puling issue for us
852821 weve been doing this for years and this is definitely our biggest turnout so far
852822 its great to see how something like this can unite so many people
852823 in order to cope with soaring food prices supply must adjust to demand for this to happen trade will help
852824 this was good in the short run but disastrous in the long term
852825 european and american farm subsidies are partly responsible for the current high food prices because they undermine farming in developing countries
852826 if the egyptians had to produce all the cereals they eat which today is very expensive there wouldnt be a drop of water in the nile so trade from time to time is a way to use natural resources where they are most readily available
852827 22 countries which had been identified as the most vulnerable to the food price crisis by the united nations food and agricultural organisation were among the worlds least trade integrated economies in agriculture
852828 jag oroar mig f r hur det blir om vi f r barn
852829 every meal they keep lecturing us about healthy foods fruit and grains and all that stuff and then we come out here and have to smell that oh man pure torture
852830 they are taking a much more conservative allocation decreasing their focus to equities but they are not putting on the brakes
852831 in the wealth management business you have to take a very long term perspective we are investing for the next decade or so
852832 i am happy to take a second place in race two because in the first race my rear tyre choice was not so good and i was disappointed with that in the second race i just changed the rear tyre and i had a good feeling with that one i had a good battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places then i would catch him up congratulations to kiyo and also my team because they made a good job to allow me to finish second
852833 race two was better than the first race we made some changes to the tyre choice and the bike and they worked well i just could not run the pace of the guys at the front because they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took a bit of time for me to get past him but i am content with third im out there trying to win races but podiums will have to do for now
852834 we did not get what we expected in the first race but we did a really good second race as a team with both riders on the podium we made the wrong tyre choice for both riders on the first one so in race two one rider went softer and the other one harder obviously each choice was a good one it was a difficult first race because of the weather delay but we made up for it well in race two well done to everyone in the team
852835 i think these guys should earn their money if you cant trade them let them stay at home were in some situations here where the same people continue to get in trouble we have to deal with it well deal with it the way we think is appropriate
852836 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
852837 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
852838 one percent of the nation owns a third of the wealth the rest of the wealth is distributed in such a way as to turn those in the 99 percent against one another small property owners against the propertyless black against white native born against foreign born intellectuals and professionals against the uneducated and unskilled these groups have resented one another and warred against one another with such vehemence and violence as to obscure their common position as sharers of leftovers in a very wealthy country
852839 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
852840 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
852841 hes tough hes got a lot of heart and an iron chin
852842 im going to have a shootout with a cowboy or with razor rob again
852843 boat owners will benefit not only will there be smooth sailing through the formerly bothersome ice of the northwest passage but each summer cruise ships will be able to run tourists straight up bourbon street in new orleans

852846 so reality is reality and the created is created reject your created nature that you may become him and he you in respect to reality
852847 it was the best of times and it was the worst of times
852848 first our inner world needs to be at peace if only our minds eyes ears and hands could genuinely understand and feel the sorrow and pain of others how many suicides could have been prevented how many conflicts in the name of money fame and position could have been avoided
852849 the first step in developing compassion is to treat all objects we regard as inanimate such as stones sand rocks and wood with love and respect
852850 never trust a man whose god is in the sky
852851 endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute a new government
852852 the cause of america is in a great measure the cause of all mankind the laying of a country with fire and sword declaring war against the natural rights of all mankind is the concern of every man to whom nature hath given the power of feeling

852854 what a magnificent challenge it would be to run without stopping all of the way around big bear lake
852855 god kind of grabbed my heart just one day when i was driving around this lake right here and he really just put it on my heart to run around it its 15 miles around the lake and i was 14 years old its not something that most 14 year olds try and do or have a desire to do he really put it on my heart to give it a shot and it was that day that i decided i wanted to act on this vision that god had given me thats what hooked me and ive been running ever since
852856 ever since i was a little kid i wanted to be an olympian what does it take to be an olympian i was dreaming about the olympics i was dreaming about competing against the best guys in the world i was just a dreamer i had big aspirations going into college
852857 i was really frustrated with the way running was going
852858 im sitting there in church and the guy who is speaking calls me up tells me to stand up and gives me this bible verse it comes from psalms 20 and it says that he will give you the desires of your heart and that we will sing for joy about your victory and that we will wave our banners high so hes giving me this prophecy at the very worst moment in my running and my training its hard to have the faith to believe that was actually going to happen
852859 what unfolded on november third at the olympic trials blew my mind away i just felt amazing during that race i just felt like i was floating out there the best way for me to describe it is when david danced before the lord with all his might unashamedly thats kind of what i was doing out there i was just praising god it was a very special moment for me one that ill always remember more so because i know what god took me through to get me to that time
852860 i know that i can live without a gold medal but at the same time it would be very exciting to win the gold medal and my goal is simply to praise god with every step i take god says my grace is sufficient for you my power is made perfect in your weakness
852861 what ive experienced is that he gives me enough strength to get me through each and every race ive competed in and to get me through those tough moments when youre hurting one of my favorite verses comes from proverbs it says though a righteous man falls seven times he rises again that describes my journey just falling and getting back up its a big part of marathon running its a big part of our spiritual walk its a big part of life just learning to get back up
852862 aim at heaven you get earth thrown in aim at earth and you get neither
852863 best thing that ever happened to those who create really good content
852864 i told her how important the color pink was and solely due to the photo on their website was the reason i choose this bouquet
852865 free fish amp fries or chicken amp fries at captain ds
852866 rearranges the old material in a manner never seen before
852867 the company and the partner florist involved have taken measures to ensure that such an episode doesn t happen again
852868 i would sooner bury my own mother with daisies from the back yard than have to deal with this company again
852869 on the backside of the lovely note that i had written was an ad for 15 off when you join the fresh rewards club since when is it a good practice to advertise on the back of a gift card
852870 we have lost those special customer relations that made shopping a personal experience

852872 consumers are entitled to know with whom they are doing business and companies who deliberately attempt to conceal their true identity or location have no business operating in our state

852876 i cant do sex but i can give you a stickjob
852877 they know my cars model number its colour and when the insurance expires its as if a hidden camera is capturing my movements
852878 you cant go to jail for data theft in india most corporates dont even bother to file cases
852879 he might have felt that by murdering students the ashram would close down and his desire to leave the ashram would be fulfiled
852880 my son has been made a scapegoat in the episode
852881 we suspect even the wood used to make the crates for planting the assembled improvised explosive devices ieds was procured from local sources as the particular kind of low quality wood used here is mainly used to make fruit crates and is freely available here
852882 defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
852883 we need to establish a broader set of space mission interests and requirements based on overall national goals not just those perceived by the nasa and carefully identify the existing and planned space program capabilities that could relate to this unified need we also need to establish independent advisory and review teams that could help to ensure that the national plan reflects a sound basis for achieving national goals and which is not swayed by regional and shortsighted special interest groups
852884 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside
852885 we do not carry out demonstrations or political activity of any kind as we have no political agenda our agenda is to protect jews wherever and whenever necessary and by any means needed
852886 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
852887 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
852888 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
852889 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
852890 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
852891 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020
852892 ive started taking fewer trips out to see him but i stay for longer periods of time
852893 and when he comes here next month hell be here for 10 11 days
852894 spending more time together on each visit means we spend time as a couple not as two people who are dating
852895 if airfares were still low i probably would still be making lots of short trips
852896 as people drink less beer than they used to they also look for better more flavoured beers people are turning back to ales now
852897 in a year that saw the british beer market suffer such hefty decline fullers actually grew its volume last year
852898 we are seeing a resurgence of english ales and english cask ales because people are looking for more personality and character in their beer
852899 people were enamoured of this new beer style that was sold in flashy cans it was served colder you never had a bad pint but you never had a good pint so people flocked to it
852900 and maybe women saw it as more glamorous than a pint of real ale
852901 sales are falling because four global breweries have more than 80 percent of the uk beer market and all they seem to produce these days are global beer brands that youll find anywhere in the world so its very boring
852902 the only breweries that seem to be brewing more beer now than before that are seeing their sales rise are the smallest breweries
852903 there are 600 microbreweries in the uk and 35 family brewers this sector of the market is very active
852904 the reality is that there are so many other sanctions on north korea because of its other behaviors that theres really no practical effect on taking them off the terrorist list

852910 we are absolutely and totally shocked hes been on a number of expeditions with me
852911 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
852912 were still discussing the possibilities of an operation because the altitude where the accident occured is very high
852913 we can take a helicopter up there to drop medicines and supplies but carrying out any operation is very difficult
852914 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
852915 our liason officer at the base camp confirmed death of five
852916 when the world record is broken it is a concern for him liu
852917 i believe at least five guys can win in beijing but liu is the favourite he is the guy to beat
852918 the biggest threat for me are the younger competitors like robles from cuba and american david oliver
852919 in the last two years these guys have really improved and oliver has broken the 13 second barrier
852920 in athens i was among the younger hurdlers so i had to fight for a good result
852921 at that time i was fighting against others but this time other hurdlers are aiming at me so i will need a very high level result beijing olympics but i will have the home field advantage
852922 we have been pulling out our staff on a gradual basis anyway in preparation for a prolonging of this dispute
852923 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mount kumgang and the area under military control from now on
852924 during the past twenty five years not a year passed that i did not pick a passage or two of gibran to teach
852925 gibran carried a message of peace crossing the boundaries of race religion and language
852926 gibran was influenced by islamic sufism and the idea of religious unity
852927 if you study gibran you cannot miss his position towards islam
852928 to muslims from a christian poet i am a christian and proud of that but i love the arab prophet and love the glory of islam and i fear for it i respect the koran but disdain those who use it as a means against the cause of muslims as i disrespect those who use the bible as a means to control christians take it from me o muslims a message from a christian jesus lives in one half of my heart while mohammed resides in the other
852929 though gibran loved his country he saw his loyalty to the whole of humanity
852930 all of earth is my homeland and humanity is my tribe
852931 gibran believed in human rights acceptance of the other mutual respect and unity in diversity
852932 sales of the prophet between 1980 and 1990 reached eight million copies and the book was translated to many languages
852933 it became the second best selling book in the us after the bible his words were not just for a certain generation in the us but the whole of humanity
852934 the members have either climbed the himalayas or have gone through some hard training
852935 it will send a positive signal to everyone that the country is heading towards free and fair polls in the third week of december this year the voting also gives us the chance to see how the digital voter list works
852936 at least two candidates have been arrested for paying money to voters
852937 despite all the government talk of finding new leaders and clean candidates the polls have become a showdown between the two main parties and their disgruntled leaders
852938 the government has managed to clean up the electoral process by framing new rules and compiling digital voter lists but it has failed to create conditions for relatively clean efficient and visionary candidates
852939 you start doing the math and thats what keeps me up at night
852940 team usa will be hard pressed to maintain its supremacy at the in beijing
852941 in terms of its gold medal progression since 1996 16 in 1996 28 in 2000 and 32 in 2004 china is clearly poised to overtake team usa in 2008
852942 this is all the more plausible given the united states gold medal regression over this same period 44 in 96 38 in 00 and 36 in 04
852943 then there would have been no trace no one would have found me out
852944 it was me who made sure she was taken to hospital
852945 in sum the french revolution did many things unleashed new forces destroyed old ideas offered new promises not the revolution itself of course but the people who made it
852946 fully 40 percent of private sector workers surveyed report that in the space of just one year a change occurred at work that required them to learn new job skills

852948 what does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today

852983 were going to be in the spotlight too if we end up getting some big hits

853039 we are disappointed in our q2 results it feels like we were hit by the perfect storm in the quarter during the period we heard concerns from customers for the first time regarding the economic enviroment and saw a strong marketing campaign from a competitor we also experienced continued delivery shifts in our backlog and had concerns related to our japanese distributor individually any one of these would likely not materially impact our business but combined they significantly affected our results

853190 young womens breasts are dense and if they get mammograms their breasts show up very white on mammograms and cancer shows up as white
853191 but as women get older their breasts are less dense and show up gray on a mammogram which makes it easy to identify the white cancer if there is a family history and women are worried they can start earlier and in this case a digital mammography may work better than a traditional mammography
853192 in fact most of the women who get mastectomies dont need them
853193 and for women to lose their breasts in addition to the normal emotional turmoil that they go through having breast cancer is harmful emotionally and physically
853194 women with early stage breast cancer usually do not need a mastectomy and will benefit from chemotherapy almost always
853195 women who get a lumpectomy will need radiation and thats the difference women who get a mastectomy will not need radiation but with a lumpectomy you always need radiation
853196 breast cancer in women younger than 30 is so rare and this is one of the things that concerns me
853197 i think the media focuses on young women because its so shocking when someone in their 20s gets cancer but what you end up with are women in their 20s and 30s who are terrified that theyre going to get cancer and women in their 50s who think they dont need to worry about it when the opposite is true
853198 its still a significant number but when you compare it to the overall number of women who get breast cancer its a small percentage
853199 what makes it fatal is if it goes into other parts of the body and gets into the lymph nodes lungs and other organs
853200 also if it gets into the blood or the bones it can kill a person thats the risk of metastasized cancer that means it has spread and once it hits the lymph nodes it can become out of control

853389 that shaban is a month between rajab and ramadan which is neglected by many people and it is a month in which an account of the deeds of human beings is presented before the lord of the universe so i wish that my deeds be presented at a time when i am in a state of fasting

853391 this is the middle night of shaban allah frees in it a large number of the people from fire more than the number of the hair growing on the sheep of the tribe kalb but he does not even look at a person who associates partners with allah or at a person who nourishes malice in his heart against someone or at a person who cuts off the ties of kinship or at a man who leaves his clothes extending beyond his ankles as a sign of pride or at a person who disobeys his parents or at a person who has a habit of drinking wine

853407 this is one of the slickest little utilities i have run across and ive tried a lot of them i never realized how handy it would be to keep all your bookmarks organized until i did it i love it
853408 linkstash is a wonderful tool for managing the bookmarks for all important browsers of today downloading the setup program is easy and fast and the installation is also fast and easy to understand the installation wizard explains everything the user needs to know when working with this software for the first time i was able to easily import my bookmarks of netscape navigator and internet explorer also a great feature of this software is the possibility to export the bookmarks for netscape and ie so it is quite easy to synchronize the bookmarks favorites of these both browsers
853409 as a satisfied user of clipcache i jumped at the opportunity to try out linkstash this is the product ive been looking for to manage my bookmarks a manager that is independent of the browser i use i routinely switch among opera internet explorer and netscape the interface is adaptable and well thought out including the ability to switch between files save and create backups and extremely stable xrayz software have spent a lot of time and energy thinking about the design of this software and it shows its a quality product in the same tradition as clipcache and i am proud to own them both
853410 as manager of several large websites and portals i have a collection of 10000 bookmarks and favorites across several browsers i find the favorites facility in explorer completely unusable and had used the old navigator 3 browser because of its far superior bookmarks manager given the age of nav 3 though this was becoming unworkable i had tried many 3rd party managers and found some had hopeless interfaces others just couldnt cope with the volume i was importing or lacked features that i needed linkstash solved all of my problems bringing my netscape bookmarks and explorer favorites together allowing me to group categorise and delete duplicates thanks linkstash for transforming what was quickly becoming a nightmare into a dream
853411 i easily imported my ie favorites and was quickly using linkstash in my browsing it is far superior to the favorites tool in ie there are no setup problems with linkstash and filing new urls in the folder where you want them is a breeze i have a very large favorites list with lots of folders with a list this size i found linkstashs tool for eliminating duplicate urls especially helpful
853412 since i switched to using internet explorer i really missed my old netscape bookmarks folder then i discovered linkstash this is ten times better now i can organize all my bookmarks in one small file synch it easily between my desktop and laptop and share it with friends and all the options for comments highlighting and customizing my bookmarks makes this a must have for surfing the net
853413 this seems to happen most often with the dead link check tool im running on xp sp2 with all updates in place this machine has been rock solid for years so i dont believe the problem is with my system kevin im surprised to hear ls is unstable on your system ive been banging on it hard for several days and its been 100 stable for me forum shows one crash report in 2008 march which was fixed in the next version i even contemplated making another glowing post about stability and blazing performance i have over 2919 bookmarks and ls returns search results in approx one second i tend to get enthusiastic about software especially if its taken me a long time to find something i like anyway when i saw your post i decided to run dead link check against all 2919 favorites up to then i only checked a few folders for fear it would take forever well not only did ls remain stable but it surprised me by finishing in just a few minutes hi mike the crashes did not occur when actually running the link check but when working with the results i dont know the exact steps to reproduce the crash but it happened at least 4 times within 1 hour even after a reboot just in case i have just over 1 500 links in firefox and they are well organized so this product wasnt critical for me but it would have been nice for the most part i love it but there are a couple of flies in my soup when exporting to html it doesnt export tags or the extended notes doesnt seem to be any way to import powermarks bookmark files and manual import is out of the question got thousands upon thousands of the little critters with keywords and notes plus ratings and color coding etc pm reached end of life a few months ago so im sure im not the only one scrambling to replace it before it quits working any idea if and when youre gonna swat these flies i am trying this out and i like it however since favicons are missing i find myself always going back to using my old bookmarks as it is so much faster to find what im looking for the fact that folks have been waiting five years for favicons to be added doesnt augur well the next release either tony setti we will certainly be enhancing the import export to support more formats please dont forget that if you buy through this offer you still get all future 2 x upgrades versions for free does not match

853416 this king is a great magician he exerts authority even over the minds of his subjects he makes them think what he wants
853417 you must not be amazed at what i tell you about this prince there is another magician stronger than he this magician is called the pope he will make the king believe that three are only one or else that the bread one eats is not bread or that the wine one drinks is not wine and a thousand other things of the same kind
853418 although the flag is seen by some southerners simply as a symbol of southern pride it is often used by racists to represent white domination of african americans
853419 if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that
853420 i am not now nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social or political equality of the white and black races i am not now nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor of intermarriages with white people there is a physical difference between the white and the black races which will forever forbid the two races living together on social or political equality there must be a position of superior and inferior and i am in favor of assigning the superior position to the white man
853421 its better for us to be separated for the good of mankind

853432 we all tried to get down from the hill many screamed and cried the situation was dramatic ive never experienced anything similar
853433 changing the date merely to create three day weekends has undermined the very meaning of the day no doubt this has contributed greatly to the general publics nonchalant observance of memorial day
853434 i have to confess that its crossed my mind that you could not be a republican and a christian
853435 if i didnt kick his ass every day he wouldnt be worth anything
853436 im not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers we are the president
853437 this vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president
853438 were saying that for america to get back on track were probably going to cut that short and not give it to you were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
853439 i think the country could be spared a lot of agony and the government could worry about inflation and a lot of other problems if nixon would go on and resign there is no question that an admission of making false statements to government officials and interfering with the fbi and the cia is an impeachable offense
853440 i did not have sexual relations with that woman ms lewinsky
853441 indeed i did have a relationship with miss lewinsky that was not appropriate in fact it was wrong
853442 i dont know whether its the finest public housing in america or the crown jewel of the american penal system
853443 last year the vice president launched a new effort to help make communities more liberal
853444 the purpose of government is to rein in the rights of the people
853445 you know the one thing thats wrong with this country everyone gets a chance to have their fair say
853446 it depends on what the meaning of the word is is
853447 ill tell you the whole story about that budget probably there are people in this room still mad at me at that budget because you think i raised your taxes too much it might surprise you to know that i think i raised them too much too
853448 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
853449 the president has kept all of the promises he intended to keep
853450 drag a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park you never know what youll find
853451 there is no one in the country presently studying this issue in a comprehensive manner as this institute is targeted to do
853452 we wont find a cure for pediatric trauma you are always going to have injuries despite our desire to prevent them and some cant be fixed
853453 but for the kids who do get hurt wed like to find a better way to help them and reduce their disability i think we can make the most difference here
853454 my main focus is how can we make sure the public has faith in our investigations
853455 were going to tell them the public what we can and theyre going to a have a little more confidence in our ability to investigate
853456 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
853457 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees

853459 my guess is that the last man to corner the soybean market whoever he was put at least as much time and creative energy into the cornering of it as say norman mailer put into his latest novel and produced something far more bearable better a rise in the price of soybeans than why are we in vietnam
853460 i would like to take you seriously but to do so would affront your intelligence
853461 i would like to electrocute everyone who uses the word
853462 the best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry
853463 back in the thirties we were told we must collectivize the nation because the people were so poor now we are told we must collectivize the nation because the people are so rich
853464 id rather entrust the government of the united states to the first 400 people listed in the boston telephone directory than to the faculty of harvard university

853477 ive been a lawyer for 20 years im not going to diminish anybodys legal work but im ready to hit the ground running on day one thats why jay nixon tapped me to defend bob holden over collective bargaining
853478 if hes running for greene county or jackson county prosecutor its probably relevant if hes saying jay nixons not been effective because hes tried one case in 16 years id disagree with him on that
853479 we think if he can take second in st louis and second in kansas city and then win in the rural areas he can win it
853480 make no mistake there are great democrats in southwest missouri and i will take that message everywhere

853491 im an avid fan of doctor who and its great to see him running the liberal party
853492 to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
853493 youve reached the tardis the doctors not here at the moment as hes off saving the universe again with a bit of a help from his friends press 1 if you have a missing planet press 2 if youre offering banana daiquiris press 3 if youre returning from a parallel universe have a brilliant day
853494 the information is somewhere on the sci fi com website i read it in one of their email newsletters there will only be four episodes next season followed by a full season of 12 episodes in 2010
853495 all praise and glory honor and power might and dominion be unto him who is lord of lords king of kings and the head of the church
853496 and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world
853497 i thank god when i call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you which dwelt first in your mother
853498 by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another
853499 when he had led them out to the vicinity of bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them while he was blessing them he left them and was carried up into heaven

853506 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away
853507 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
853508 we are committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
853509 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
853510 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
853511 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
853512 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
853513 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
853514 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking

853522 each of us has a body clock which has a trough at certain times of day and at other times a peak for the average person the trough is about 4am and the peak around 7pm or 8pm a lark would get up about an hour earlier than average be the life and soul of the breakfast table and then start flaking as the day progresses an owl probably gets up an hour later than average and starts to feel better later in the day going to bed an hour or two later than average
853523 they tend to be more larkish as children becoming much more owlish throughout adolescence and at their most owlish in their early twenties in old age they become more of a lark again so its down to age and habit and to a lesser extent genes
853524 we found that people with a long version of period 3 were much more likely to be morning types and those with the short version were likely to be evening types
853525 its simply that there tended to be more morning people who had the long version
853526 and thats early nights however good the party you have to leave im in bed at 9pm come hell or high water
853527 in summer when the suns already up i open the windows wide and do a bit of yoga
853528 i like waking up to the nice scottish burr of rhod sharp on radio 5 live
853529 they showed signs of being much more tired and also showed a dramatic fall in cognitive performance
853530 the owl is more adaptable and more able to be a lark larks are more rigid in behaviour
853531 if flowers on your nightstand make you want to sing a song then great but this is more a behavioural phenomenon than a physiological one you might be an owl at 20 but when you have children youll be forced into being a lark basically youve just got to do it

853535 if a malicious app or hacker has already obtained access to the file system or some other entity then you have bigger problems to worry about

853537 ability to continue to play their important role in financing mortgages and in our capital markets more broadly
853538 that men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history
853539 why do people hate investment bankers so much because there really is no noble cause to what they do unlike doctors teachers etc its about money money money money is their drive and to get more of it is the goal
853540 ibanking captivates everyone because anyone can do the jobs an ibanker does at the analyst level
853541 ibanking especially in the lower levels require little or no natural skill and even a chinese confucian history major can be a ibanking analyst nothing against chinese confucian history majors
853542 the bankers and lawyers are usually the conspiracy theory guys
853543 i bankers make horrible poker players since they tend to overanalyze and are slower decision makers
853544 though law ibankng are not as exciting as playing markets they do provide a great outlet to learn to eventually do so
853545 if you prefer to work like a dog over useless things like pitchbooks and slaving over excel spreadsheets than maybe you are cut for the ibd m amp a is what most people go to
853546 if a person wants to get some solid finance experience coming out of undergrad its hard to beat a traditional i banking analyst position in terms of flexibility in career path i e post analyst options mba private equity vcs etc
853547 for a lot of folks out there who want to get comprehensive exposure to the world of finance in the shortest possible time with a certain degree of structure training relative safety and maximum flexibility post 2 years i banking is still a great choice
853548 most investment bankers cannot and do not become traders trading and banking just involve totally different skill sets and personality types
853549 bankers are way more risk averse bankers also tend to over analyze things
853550 the cream of the crop goes to i banking and i bankers are usually a lot smarter and quicker on their feet than anyone on the trading floor
853551 most ex bankers that ive seen come to hedge funds do not trade but rather work in some support advisory position
853552 in investment banking a relatively small number of highly skilled individuals maybe capable of the lions share of the really profitable deals
853553 at first glance ibanking seems like something anyone could do well im not sure it is something anyone could do
853554 my uncle told me to be an investment banker instead of a astrophysicist because they make incredible amounts of money
853555 i am seeing the pay for being an investment banker to be 100k starting why isnt everyone an investment banker then is there something big i missed
853556 investment bankers particularly junior ones can be expected to work up to 70 hours a week that is 12 hours every weekday and 5 hours on weekends if you work out the hourly rate for working in investment banking it may be lower than the hourly rate youll get in another college educated position where you only work 40 50 hours a week

853561 credit ratings on some aaa pieces were cut to junk levels
853562 thats half of where prices are today and gas prices would reflect that
853563 prices will reflect closer the marginal cost of producing oil
853564 surely demand and supply cannot explain what has happened over the last 12 months
853565 oil prices were 70 a barrel in august 2007 and how is it that theyve doubled when there has been no dramatic change in demand

853581 the allegations were made by activists from the anti whaling organisation greenpeace japan who themselves allegedly stole whale meat from the aomori branch of seino transportation ltd
853582 the greenpeace activists claimed that the meat they stole was proof of large scale whale meat thefts
853583 kyodo senpaku and the icr have conducted a thorough investigation of the claims by greenpeace and found that all of their allegations are false
853584 the seafarers involved have been cleared of all claims made against them
853585 for many years i have watched with horror and dismay as the whaling ships leave port and head towards the southern ocean sanctuary in pursuit of whales a shiver runs down my spine when i recall the deeply disturbing images of the hunt of the harpooned whale thrashing in the water as it slowly dies red blood in the blue water tortured death throws lasting up to an hour i am deeply disturbed by these events and i am not alone around the world hundreds of thousands of people are horrified by these brutal actions but they have found no single voice to speak of their feelings i would like this sculpture to become their voice

853598 to operate on its own either directly or through a subsidiary entity or license to others tourism related activities including games amusements recreational and sports facilities such as horse racing dog racing gambling casinos golf courses and others under priorities and standards set by the ceza
853599 i know for a fact that the cyber gambling operations there port irene have operations outside of ceza they have facilities at rcbc plaza in makati
853600 it gives them an unfair advantage over their rivals i think the senate should include ceza gambling in the hearings and ask why this is not included under pagcors jurisdiction

853611 unfortunately injuries happen in sport the team gathers itself and moves on its a setback for her we are going to try and use it within the team to try and be better
853612 with the increased amount of time playing and training it has recurred she couldnt continue
853613 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
853614 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
853615 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
853616 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
853617 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
853618 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
853619 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
853620 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
853621 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
853622 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
853623 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
853624 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
853625 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

853627 and to some extent you have to credit the literary works of alexander solzhenitsyn with helping to bring down the last empire on earth
853628 the last remaining prophet in the abandoned temple of absolute truth
853629 during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written
853630 we all know that an artists work cannot be contained within the wretched dimension of politics
853631 for this dimension cannot hold the whole of our life and we must not restrain our social consciousness within its bounds
853632 in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
853633 it is as if just having survived the heaviest case of cholera to immediately upon recuperation get the plague
853634 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
853635 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
853636 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
853637 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
853638 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia
853639 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
853640 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
853641 we hope this trial will be viewed as timely and beneficial research in an area where there is clearly a demonstrated need for safe and effective products to treat cold and flu in children who suffer from these ailments much more than adults
853642 these results are promising and support the development of a childrens formulation
853643 current estimates suggest that 41 to 45 of children in canada and the united states use nhps
853644 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
853645 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
853646 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
853647 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming
853648 my nose was broken in about ten place and i fractured my cheek bone and i sprained my neck
853649 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
853650 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
853651 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
853652 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
853653 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
853654 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
853655 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
853656 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
853657 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
853658 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
853659 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials
853660 by gathering ideas from the community we can continue to improve the services our dedicated staff members provide to the residents of galveston county
853661 community input will allow staff to meet goals that were established in a strategic health plan adopted in 2004
853662 the plan approved by the galveston county united board of health is designed to make measurable improvements in the health of galveston county
853663 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
853664 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
853665 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
853666 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation
853667 logan is new englands largest airport and we have the most traffic and the most variety of traffic so its a natural fit to have it established here
853668 we see this as a model that could increase economic opportunities for people in developing countries
853669 if you just know how to type that can be the difference between earning 1 an hour instead of 1 a day
853670 my generation all had apple iis that we learned to type and play games on
853671 if we can get buy in from programmers we can develop these devices and give third world schools apple ii computer labs like the ones i grew up with
853672 the idea of getting people from all of these different backgrounds together to create new technologies is just stunning
853673 were creating an environment thats rife with possibilities for innovation and invention
853674 so many babies in developing countries are dying because theyre premature and dont have a good environment
853675 if we can provide good conditions all of the babies survive
853676 one of the things were trying to do is help people become innovators and creators so that theyre not just waiting for external people to come solve their problems
853677 if you have my copy of box office poison please give it back

853682 it was a bit of a mixed bag today even if near the end of the first race we were riding around in the rain it wasnt really a good race but that second one was a lot better i didnt really have the pace to match the front guys and i had a little problem with my front brake i adjusted it and started to catch them back up and then i saw craig crash right in front of me going into the straight it was not a good day at the office really
853683 i felt really good out there but i had a vague feeling from the front end it was the same in the first half of the race and i actually preferred that setting we went with an sc1 front tyre but it didnt feel that good at all im gutted to have fallen but i was running up the front in my first wss racing for a few years
853684 technically we didnt have a lot of problems in the race karl tried to do his best and he was doing a lot under braking to keep up with the guys but finally he went out in the first race they should have flagged it three laps before and broc had more rain on his visor than he would have liked to see so he lost two seconds to the guy who won the first heat he was there with the group but he had some difficulties everybody was sliding about a bit to be honest the final result is very disappointing
853685 i took some time to get started in both the first and second legs of the race but when i did get up to speed the bike and everything was ok but by that time the leading group was gone so i could not catch them up
853686 oh youre blood test says your hearing voices so well just fix you right up
853687 this is your great grandfathers and he has had to do his share of mercy killing to
853688 i rented maybe 7 or 8 fairchilds and on a blind test on a christina aguilera vocal i liked this plug in better i didnt know what was what this plug in is all over her latest album stripped rca 2002 the screen shot shows the setting that i used
853689 its the first plug in that allows you to take a chorus a flanger a wah a delay and a reverb and combine them into one effect and its very efficient in its use of dsp the distortion is great for vocals guitars and keyboards its my new favorite effect its so new that we havent had a chance to use on any records yet i like it because its finally a plug in that really gives you your moneys worth its not just a half assed chorus or a half assed distortion it has world class versions of all of those things i think that plug in sets the precedent for the future in terms of what you get for your money
853690 the mcdsp e series filter bank plug in is my favorite neve eq emulator the setting shown here is a good neve vocal sound the problem that i have with a lot of old neve eqs is that theyve all been modified so much that you never know what youre getting you can quote me on this who the hell can remember the differences between a 1081 a 1073 a 10 this a 10 that they all have their little quirks and idiosyncrasies what i like more about the filter bank version than the original version is that im not limited to certain clicks or certain presets like the original has but i can get in between the cracks im not limited to just a 1073 or 83 but i can do shades and variations of the two you can get some 21 st century brightness out of this plug in that you cant get out of the original and then the low end without phase shift is just real sweet
853691 this is a great example that i really want people to understand
853692 to me of all the equalizers you could use on a vocal i like this best but youre saying thats not an equalizer thats a compressor the way i set it up its set up as a dynamic equalizer in other words what im doing is im telling the compressor to only compress the frequency that ive set it for im telling the compressor that whenever the frequency gets above a certain threshold knock it down but youre saying why cant you do that with an equalizer well you can but its just not as smooth for some reason if you listen to christina aguilera she sings her verses smooth and powerful and round and the compressor if you could actually watch it is actually doing nothing on those verses but when she gets to the high notes she gets a lot of 2 khz in her vocal and the compressor automatically pulls that down and makes the vocals sound less harsh and less piercing and you can control the amount you want to leave in christina actually likes a little bit of that in her vocal so i cant pull too much out but the compressor does it automatically this setting is useful on just about everything if you move the frequency to 8 khz or 10 khz then youve automatically got a de esser the only thing youve got to be aware of is that it will automatically add about a 340 sample delay to your sound so just highlight the waveform and shift it to the left 340 samples and youll be okay of all the plug ins that i use its the most utilitarian the setting shown here is my setting of all the secrets im giving away that could potentially be the most useful
853693 this plug in points out waves philosophy to not just make plug ins that emulate whats in the real world but to actually transcend whats in the real world
853694 the l1 is my favorite limiter its got a lot of the attributes of an la 2a but none of the negatives i really think that 40 years from now the l1 will be looked at as a classic just like the fairchild compressor is looked at as a classic today people fawning over software the way they do great analog compressors of today the l1 i used on all of christina aguileras lead vocals on her last album i use it last in the chain and the setting that you see in this screen shot is straight off the song dirty from christinas last album
853695 its a real versatile transparent compressor that wasnt intentionally designed to emulate any one compressor but to emulate the best components of all the compressors

853712 even if its only the handful of people i meet in the streets or in my home i can still protect them with one sword

853720 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
853721 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
853722 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
853723 hes probably been under pressure more so this year than ever before with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
853724 the defence has been under more pressure than ever so i think those two things combined have probably put darren under a lot of pressure and its probably showing his injury to be worse than it probably is get the best of foxtel

853798 the ministries that continue not to cooperate appear to be heeding the advice of attorneys who are not familiar with congressional oversight in general and specifically the finance committees oversight and legislative work in the area of tax exempt organizations over the last seven years

853801 religious conservatives like ourselves believe this to be an unfortunate development but if donors do not insist on even greater levels of ministry cooperation with donor advocate organizations unneeded government regulation is sure to follow
853802 it has been donors willingness to ignore the clear warning signs from a relatively few questionable ministries that will partly cause any increased government oversight
853803 the ministry communitys unwillingness to call out those who are simultaneously abusing donors the word of god and current government regulations through meaningful self policing also is to blame for any burdensome new regulations

853821 they tell stories that gays eat faeces and have up to 2 000 sexual partners a year
853822 once he started talking about jesus at christmas and went into a complete tirade against gay people claiming that gays were trying to get rid of christmas
853823 they are very much aware of the fact that they would breach vilification laws
853824 the homosexuals are trying to convince themselves and others that their perverted sexual dealings are very satisfying thats why they call themselves gay as if they are in perpetual bliss and are free
853825 we believe that a focus on removal of regulatory obstacles to efficient real time price signals and demand response at the federal and state levels can be an important step toward appropriate efficient reliance on conventional price mechanisms to handle scarcity and guide investment
853826 the public should not expect economic benefits to result from the package
853827 policy makers confronting pressures to undo the restructuring of the electricity industry would be well advised to base their decisions on the longer term benefits that will flow from properly implementing competitive markets
853828 i felt very isolated and singled out somehow as though i was the only one with alzheimers
853829 it allows them to inspire each other they find a new confidence in themselves which keeps them strong now jim is very open about his illness and doesnt hide the fact that he has it our family including five grandchildren and close friends are all supportive
853830 i grew up on the croft that i live on today i have a fishery that i enjoy spending time at as well as a horse that i look after im never bored
853831 i feel i can relax around the other couples as we are all in the same boat we have met so many new friends through jims group
853832 do you know how can i get the mtv neck tag
853833 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
853834 ngalor ngidul wetan ngulon ngumba moto ngalor ngidul wetan ngulon cuci mata
853835 wah tp ini mall terbesar di indo ya kok di bandung ga ada yang segede ini ya
853836 obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight 3 of the falcon 1
853837 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
853838 released with some initial success a couple of months ago and we did see some of our players leave to try the game however weve seen about 40 percent of those players return to world of warcraft
853839 on my old computer with tiger when i made a new folder it automaticly highlighted so you could get started remaming the folder immediately
853840 about my folder problem well i let it rest a couple of days and it magicly dissapeared it just acts normal now well well probably never now what happened
853841 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
853842 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
853843 its gonna shock me a lot too sad cause its unbelievable that my brother could do that
853844 yeah it was shock my daughter said yeah he was taken away in handcuffs
853845 i was wondering how come his van was smashed in the front
853846 i thought he banged someone from the back because one side of the front was all pushed in
853847 the van still has some damage on it that corroborate the fact that it most likely is the van that was involved in that collision
853848 i think if you do hit somebody then the proper thing is tend to them its not right you dont do things like that
853849 sometimes we put out a description of a vehicle it may not be correct it may be correct
853850 it was a stupid prank that scared the airport staff but no law has been broken
853851 the purpose of the program is not to poke fun at people of short stature it is about twisted and extreme situations which are entertaining
853852 our mission as game developers is to create games where we can share the joy and experience of our world with those of our non gaming friends
853853 do it right and it will make you rich too
853854 its easier for our software to compete with linux when theres piracy than when theres not
853855 are you kidding you can get the real thing and you get the same price
853856 we start changing the perception that microsoft is the company coming just to do antipiracy and sue people we changed the companys image were the company that has the long term vision if a foreign companys strategy matches with the governments development agenda the government will support you even if they dont like you
853857 there was synergy which we formalized between the need of the chinese economy to have local software capability and our need for an ecosystem of companies around us using our technology and platform
853858 making the talent search more difficult is the fact that the more experienced managers are in short supply and command high salaries
853859 for multinationals it is now a challenge not only to recruit the best people but also to develop and retain them
853860 a lot of young chinese managers bear this burden and will readily move between employers in order to get a bigger salary more status and more opportunities this is one of the reasons why staff turnover rates are often very high in china
853861 it is an approach that should be mutually beneficial because it allows students to be trained in a way that is useful to the multinational
853862 those students then have a fast track into a job with that multinational when they graduate
853863 teamwork and creativity are qualities still in short supply among chinese managers
853864 we created public service messages announcements and warnings for the government on aids and slowly we began to have more access to the real story
853865 extend your arm bear the pain of a needle then flex your arm 50 yuan is earned
853866 a feeling of malaise with a bitof insecurity that china and india is fast on the heels of both the us and the eu
853867 no es necesario q expliquen de nuevo cuales son los requisitos
853868 i dont think it would take that much more work on their part to make a much easier way to navigate through their catalog perhaps by just adding a few more well selected categories to their list on the left half of the screen
853869 the carlton welcomes you to its plastic world square lenses surrounded by a particular transparent brown color with arms to keep the balance you need strong glasses for the ones with a strong personality
853870 you should also be able to get your pd from your previous eyeglass supplier this figure does not expire with age they have to give it to you by federal law as well as your full prescription it is your property
853871 just because i use a pupilometer that doesnt mean that i cant use a ruler
853872 i use the pupilometer to measure adults but i still dot the pupil then i have something to compare i am usually within 5 mm each eye
853873 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
853874 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
853875 the same people who sell them today at 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
853876 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments
853877 so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication
853878 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
853879 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
853880 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
853881 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
853882 info nugget would popup at times during the video to show amusing facts and comments
853883 i tell people you havent lived until youre dancing spontaneously in a park
853884 wed make lamps and other things and wed say what are we going to do with this stuff
853885 she decided to open a shop in parkville where artists could sell their work
853886 she worked really hard and expected other people to work hard too she would meet people see what their strengths were and pull it out of them and there was never any slacking off
853887 she was the reason that town came back to life
853888 jan brought downtown together she opened a business before the town could actually support the business and she was generous she would open her door and point out to her customers all the other stores where they could go
853889 she brought us up so she didnt even have to say of course you can do it
853890 she had three daughters who were all very different girls but she gave each something of her own they are just wonderful women
853891 using her terms but shed never use them on herself she was fearless industrious drop dead gorgeous and above all gutsy
853892 a igreja cat lica sempre impregnou na cabe a das pessoas que riqueza coisa do mal e que pobreza boa
853893 como voc s sabem os governadores dos povos pag os t m autoridade sobre eles e mandam neles mas entre voc s n o pode ser assim pelo contr rio quem quiser ser importante que sirva os outros e quem quiser ser o primeiro que seja o escravo de todos porque at o filho do homem n o veio para ser servido mas para servir e dar a sua vida para salvar muita gente
853894 and that means high price equals luxury asians need a modern set of symbols to define who they are which means you are what you wear
853895 our concept of a party is to eat and drink sitting around circular tables
853896 if you dont help him order his glasses soon im going to leave you
853897 why dont you ever want to do anything around the house
853898 if you use one of your children to save the life of another are you being a good mother or a very bad one
853899 im telling you if aliens landed on earth today and took a good hard look at why babies get born theyd conclude that most people have children by accident or because they drink too much on a certain night or because birth control isnt one hundred percent or for a thousand other reasons that really arent very flattering
853900 note that alter table doesnt work so hot when you want to add a field in the middle of others and there are a plethora of constraints on the table
853901 i would have refused in any event a request for a second recount as the election team had carried out a thorough recount of your votes and it was very unlikely that any additional votes would have been found in your name i also took into consideration the fact that even had a second bundle been found that this would have made no difference whatsoever to the outcome of your election nor indeed on you losing your deposit i concluded that it would be unreasonable to delay the declaration any longer given that it was already fast approaching 3 00am on friday morning
853902 under conditions in which there were 26 candidates on the ballot paper it meant that the sep would have achieved the tenth highest vote rather than fourteenth
853903 would involve a tract called k18 near the kurdish city of erbil a consortium founded by turkish company ak group international is seeking rights to drill there the documents say potential backers include two turkish companies as well as kazakhstan according to individuals involved
853904 a washington consultant and adviser to the government of kazakhstan
853905 even if we cannot prove to the standards that we enjoy in our own civil society that they were involved we do know for example that saddam hussein has ties to osama bin laden
853906 i dont think a vaccine specialist could do it this is aerosol physics not biology there are very few people who have their feet in both camps
853907 i really dont think hes the guy i say to the fbi show me your evidence
853908 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
853909 mourns the loss of dr bruce ivins who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist
853910 that seems like an unusual thing to say if you believe one of your employees had something to do with an anthrax attack
853911 it now remains incumbent on the fbi to reveal what information it had linking ivins to the attacks given the federal governments record on the anthrax investigation and the national security interests involved ivins death should not be used as an excuse for the case to be closed without a full public airing
853912 the family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the fbi has accumulated that theyre not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat
853913 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
853914 dozens of other researchers in ivins lab also had access to the type of ames strain used in the attacks the scientist said meaning the dna alone is not enough to prove his guilt
853915 the fbi owes it to the country to provide some accounting of their investigation and their expectations for a successful conclusion
853916 its been frustrating that the fbi has essentially shut out congress throughout its seven year investigation now seems to be the opportune time for the bureau to brief congress about whether the case is to be closed and justice will be served in the meantime we should remember that a rush to judgment can be dangerous and expensive for everyone the last person the fbi had in its sights in this case suffered for six years and just collected a 6 million settlement
853917 he was surprised by the question and although he said hed been speaking with reporters all day none of the other reporters not one of them had asked him about his brothers political affiliations leanings or beliefs
853918 this exercise will be conducted under a scenario that an imaginary enemy force infiltrates the territorial waters of dokdo
853919 increasing military tensions would do no good in the goal of strengthening bilateral relations
853920 have thoroughly studied the depth temperatures and tidal streams of all the seas and channels around japan and in every season
853921 there is a danger that china and taiwan could form an anti japan alliance over their common territorial claim over the senkaku islands
853922 its like when your friend who has sided however tacitly with you on an issue suddenly declares neutrality you cant help but feel betrayed
853923 there is also a danger of massive anti us protests over the beef and dokdo issues during bushs visit which could overshadow attempts to mend the alliance
853924 the us has expressed a neutral stance toward dokdo but china has showed its utmost concern over the double standards the japanese side has repeatedly applied to its territorial disputes
853925 the uk regulators were fully aware for a decade that equitable life was effectively insolvent yet they allowed the society to suck in another 20 billion in pension contributions from more than one million new investors
853926 principally the society was the author of its own misfortunes regulatory failures were secondary factors
853927 building false expectations of regulators can lead to a destruction of public confidence
853928 those responsible for undertaking financial regulation should act in a way that is compatible with the duties and powers which parliament has conferred upon them those responsible for the prudential regulation of equitable life failed to do so throughout the period covered in my report
853929 misleading and unbalanced with assurances being provided that the society was solvent when that was in considerable doubt and was not the view of always held within the fsa
853930 secondly there is a public interest in encouraging people to make long term financial provision for themselves so that an aging population looks less to the state for its pensions
853931 by mid 2003 virtually every insurance company in the uk was technically bankrupt and receiving waivers from the fsa
853932 ok the first thing thats very important to understand is that if you do not have control of who is seeing you and choosing you
853933 the slowdown was inevitable what has been shocking is the speed at which it has hit
853934 this looks pretty bad but when once considers the unemployment rate usually falls in the second quarter by an average of 0 6 percentage points in the last five years the figure looks truly terrible
853935 we make enormous efforts and huge sacrifices especially at the financial level to fight the flow of illegal migrants
853936 putting the accent on respect for the identities of the member states
853937 to obey the laws to learn the language and to respect spanish customs
853938 for the time being all we see is a fledgling effort to harmonise policies and build a common eu immigration policy the latter started in 2005 largely through pressure from spain it is often forgotten that when we began the process of normalisation that european framework did not exist and that spain was the main driving force behind it
853939 its not a positive solution the government has been trying to reactivate the labour market but these are people who have been working up until now they should be treated the same as spaniards no one is telling a worker in madrid from zaragoza that he has to go back to zaragoza just because hes out of work
853940 under no circumstances do i want this to turn into a tool for segregation
853941 this eliminates the notion of integration from within the education system what needs to be done is to reinforce existing resources in schools and hire more teachers if necessary
853942 significant wage competition is beginning to emerge at the lowest wage levels forcing spanish men to be more flexible when it comes to accepting pay cuts
853943 unfortunately the behaviour of the housing market in the us leads us to believe that the worst case scenario might not be too far away from the most likely scenario
853944 we have no direct exposure to us sub prime we have no exposure to us sub prime or mortgage related cdos collateralised debt obligations in fact our total exposure to cdos is 5 5 million
853945 we also have to expect further volatility and further stress in the international credit markets in terms of funding costs and we will have to continue to pass that on
853946 australian bulls like to believe life is different down under the commodity boom and full employment the argument goes offer a buffer against defaults by extension lending banks are sitting pretty once you erase the toxic made in the us paper but the australian consumer does not look that robust household debt to income ratios at 177 percent are higher than in the us according to morgan stanley houses are every bit as over valued as elsewhere if not more so the average house price ratio is 5 5 times
853947 well placed to withstand the fallout swan revealed that he and prime minister kevin rudd had held an urgent weekend meeting to discuss the situation with the reserve bank and the australian prudential regulation authority apra which is meant to monitor the banks
853948 its higher interest rates from the major banks higher costs of living its the credit squeeze its the uncertainty in household wealth and falling share markets which are making people stay away from the shops
853949 there is no doubt that the australian market will see more foreclosures repossessions and bankruptcies over the coming years
853950 there are probably millions of australians who have never seen their fund statement show the end balance less than the opening balance
853951 under socialism all this will of course be altered there will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags and bringing up unhealthy hunger pinched children in the midst of impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings socialism communism or whatever one chooses to call it by converting private property into public wealth and substituting co operation for competition will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism and ensure the material well being of each member of the community
853952 let no one believe however that the cultivated englishman openly brags with his egotism
853953 duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in
853954 the old solution the old way was to think that public money alone could end these problems
853955 we have more will than wallet but will is what we need we will make the hard choices
853956 the corporation believes that volunteering is not just nice to do but a necessary aspect of meeting the most pressing needs facing our nation including poverty illiteracy care for the elderly disaster response and youth in need of mentors to help them succeed in life
853957 citizen involvement volunteerism in public health public safety and disaster relief
853958 mas vale que no me pidan mas cosas hasta las 12 loco al final ac el nico que labura soy yo
853959 voy a sportivo a jugar unos pooles por guita y chau
853960 c e r r a d o p o r q u e h o y n o t e n g o g a n a s d e a b r i r
853961 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
853962 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
853963 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
853964 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
853965 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
853966 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
853967 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
853968 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
853969 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
853970 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
853971 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
853972 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
853973 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
853974 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
853975 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
853976 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
853977 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
853978 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil
853979 reduction of dependence on foreign oil and concerns over prices
853980 i do believe that the rise in cost is primarily due to futures speculation and much less to do with supply demand
853981 this pov has actually nothing to do with e mc2 and pre supposes that humans the american variety in this case cannot adapt to changing economic conditions
853982 what im saying here is that the political argument that the path to us energy independence is primarily through the reduction of us dependence on
853983 the united states more than anyone has the technology money and ability to embrace energy conservation renewable resources and alternative energy technologies
853984 i do believe that the rise in cost is primarily due to futures speculation and much less to do with supply demand
853985 this pov has actually nothing to do with e mc2 and pre supposes that humans the american variety in this case cannot adapt to changing economic conditions
853986 what im saying here is that the political argument that the path to us energy independence is primarily through the reduction of us dependence on
853987 the united states more than anyone has the technology money and ability to embrace energy conservation renewable resources and alternative energy technologies
853988 weve figured out how to break them in as little as 30 seconds
853989 medeco wont admit it though they still believe in security through obscurity
853990 through an inquiry to the national crime information center and obtained nonpublic information from the state driver vehicle system regarding a minnesota license plate number
853991 give us a written estimate and well get back to you
853992 during one of the past few days i had occasion to visit the u
853993 read that book before it was a new york times best seller
853994 everything you wanted to know but were afraid of asking
853995 anyway was this debate supposed to be about whether or not the stories of jesus and or horus were true or whether or not the two figures are similar
853996 how sweet are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth
853997 ok im supposed to say the strawberry sunshine but personally i think the mango hurricane or brazilian thunder are the best
853998 frankly there was a lot of dispute at the time it was granted to them
853999 circumstances have changed with oil at these levels we dont think that manufacturers credit is necessary to encourage them to explore and produce oil and gas
854000 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
854001 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
854002 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore
854003 its only a logical extension of whats happening in the gulf right now plus that area has been identified as an area where resources are available right now
854004 if anybody wants to drill off florida theyll have a fight on their hands
854005 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
854006 it doesnt make a whole lot of sense just to open everything up right now and think that were going to have a rush by the folks who do the exploration to go all over america
854007 take a look at it and see if theres aspects of it that we could embrace
854008 when we come back we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
854009 pinky was my greyhound romeos favorite toy he had picked it out himself at the pet store they had had a loving relationship until simon came along simon is our foster greyhound i had hid pinky from him cause simon loves stuffies a little too much he found poor pinky and that is all that is left of him

854018 overall the jobs data did give the us dollar some support he said from singapore
854019 the jobless numbers were not as big as the market had expected and thats helping the us dollar hold its gains
854020 the economy is slowing and the rba may have to cut rates sooner rather than later mr lee said
854021 act declared to be a statute by crown and parliament recognition act 1689 c
854022 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to oppose the private members bill exempting westminster from the foi act 2000
854023 the freedom of information amendment bill from david maclean mp a member of the house of commons commission which runs the house of commons plans to exempt the uk parliament entirely from its own foi act it seems to have informal support from some ministers and has passed its early stages with virtually no discussion or opposition foi would still apply to all the devolved parliaments assemblies what is so different about westminster is it because mps dont like us knowing about their expenses or other activities in detail westminster operates on our behalf and should remain fully accountable to us just as it expects other public bodies to be accountable to it and to us

854055 what my baby wants my baby gets you know that
854056 i know i asked for 12 but you should have read my mind and known that i wanted 436
854057 wait what ummm ok i m sorry do you think you can work with 12 for tonight
854058 yeah fine of course you always expect me to fix everything and make it all work this is just like the time you went out with your friends and came home late
854059 what how is this anything like that you told me that i could go do you remember that you re the one who said it was okay
854060 you are such a jerk leave me alone i need some time to myself
854061 ummmm do you really need time to yourself or is this just a test where i m supposed to read into that and instead of giving you space you want me to comfort you
854062 when you go to google youll end up with a lot of search results and you need to sieve through them
854063 itll be good to have something that gets you what you need
854064 there are a lot of resources out there but there has to be quality control
854065 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
854066 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
854067 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
854068 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
854069 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher
854070 we talk a lot about remedial and enrichment work and it takes a lot of time not only for the teacher but also for students
854071 digitalisation is changing the way students learn and we have to accept that
854072 i guess well only know how much easier when it comes into use
854073 my favorite moment of the tour so far was after the show
854074 walking out and seeing everybody for the first time lined up outside the crowd of people was throwing down notes and posters that was the first time i really felt like that love
854075 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
854076 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chapstick
854077 i have no idea wait who sings this song is she pretty
854078 well i think guys like it when two hot pretty girls kiss each other because its just doubling things that we like its a two for one special id like a big mac but two big macs are always better even if im not hungry i can save it for later

854084 a conservation assessment of the terrestrial ecoregions of latin america and the caribbean
854085 guys i have to level with you there are people in my party who would like to change the law and it may likely happen in a couple of years that we are going to be like michigan or france in our labor environment
854086 the choice by volkswagen does not come without reciprocal help in the form of incentives from the state and local levels those incentives need to be fully revealed to tennesseans although volkswagen officials say the incentives were not the driving force behind the move and state officials are either being coy or genuinely dont know the full package yet to give details on incentives
854087 are we stagnating and unnaturally suffocating the transformations that must naturally occur in order for a system to sustain itself are we thinking too small with agile and are we afraid to allow and support the natural progression agiles usefulness and sustainability
854088 what does an agile transition look like when it comes as a mandate from the top
854089 how to turn resistance from a frustration into a resource whatever else it may be resistance is information about the people we are asking to change about the environment in which the change will happen about the changes we recommend and about ourselves
854090 the facilitators hope that participants will gain a deeper understanding of why people resist change possibly even why they themselves resist change based on an improved appreciation for different perspectives and different priorities we also hope participants will be able to return to their own organizations with a toolkit of effective and practical methods to overcome resistance to change
854091 nobuaki katayama chief engineer of lexus sc and is talked to software engineers about process principles and practices of new car development in toyota at developers summit 2008 in tokyo on feb 13 2008
854092 in this session we will discuss how i embrace the agile principles of simple design low tech tools and evolutionary development to teach java in a test first manner giving students a foundation in unit testing and refactoring while learning the java language
854093 provides ideas and approaches on how to promote a culture of continuous improvement and perpetual learning among teams of software developers in a corporate setting it provides specific examples of approaches that have been successful at large companies such as travelers insurance and google focusing not only on how to spread knowledge but also on how to evaluate progress and measure success
854094 why should i pay for two to do the job of one
854095 why should i pay for unit testing get it right the first time
854096 in the recording industry producers help guide production by balancing creativity with costs quality and schedules the great producers value and nurture the uniqueness of each project the producer helps the players and others complete the project while providing a time and space for improvisation sustainable agility often starts with an agile coach helping a community find its unique groove like the music producer the coach needs to help the individuals as well as the community innovate and deliver
854097 narrative testing leverages script based testing tools and dstls to express story tests in the users own language developers and customers cooperate to create customer readable scripts based on user stories which are executed interactively against the application ui through narrative testing customers are able to view the executing test and to experientially tie steps in the test to changes in the application state increasing customer confidence in testing
854098 this 90 minute presentation exposes the weaknesses of trying to use formal project management on emergent endeavours and outlines the leadership and collaboration based alternatives using humour analogy and case studies the limitations of a command and control management along with carrot and stick motivation approaches for software projects are examined and leadership empowered teams based options introduced
854099 in this session we define a framework for agile managers with eight competency areas then springboard into a highly interactive discovery session with breakouts by competency participants will leave with tools and best practices they can use immediately to help the manager in their life competency areas include organizational change management value stream amp internal partner management agile portfolio management and performance management
854100 when individuals become a members of a group behavior changes the group becomes focal and the individuals become background the group behaves as a system and exhibits system level behavior groups as a system exhibit primitive emotional behaviors that can derail the group from its stated primary task
854101 what does agile want to be when it grows up
854102 is a developer practice that involves automatically running tests after every change even so much as a single statement this session will cover the history theory practice and daily application of ct to real world projects
854103 by cleanly standing outside the team we help reveal the system to itself leading to greater team self awareness higher cohesion and more conscious self organization moving beyond the right and wrong of individual issues we facilitate long term persistent changes which benefit the whole system we will demonstrate three techniques with the audience as participants to demonstrate this exciting new approach
854104 after presentation of key tps concepts small groups will explore commonalities between agile and tps by developing mind maps and then exchange the results
854105 with their cookbook of agile for the 21st century executive chef in this upbeat real life experiences presentation we offer the recipes that succeed how they succeeded and what the amazing results were additionally we intend to arm you with warning signs that your recipes for agile adoption may produce very unsatisfactory results and even flop
854106 in this client organization agile methods were not producing expected improvements primarily because the stakeholders could not agree on priorities of the work the team decided to use extremely short iterations to expose the problems caused by a lack of prioritization
854107 this tutorial presents an approach utilizing leading edge research and techniques from social complexity science and team dynamics to change the dynamics of a team with the aim of optimizing their work together
854108 working in teams students participate in hands on exercises that go from business case through to a first production release
854109 in this workshop we will offer a toolbox of strategies to help deal with different contracting scenarios and promote agile practices protect the development organization and provide value and protection to the contracting organization
854110 perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but when there is nothing left to take away
854111 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
854112 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
854113 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
854114 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
854115 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
854116 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
854117 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
854118 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
854119 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
854120 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
854121 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
854122 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
854123 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
854124 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
854125 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
854126 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
854127 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
854128 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil
854129 reduction of dependence on foreign oil and concerns over prices
854130 i do believe that the rise in cost is primarily due to futures speculation and much less to do with supply demand
854131 this pov has actually nothing to do with e mc2 and pre supposes that humans the american variety in this case cannot adapt to changing economic conditions
854132 what im saying here is that the political argument that the path to us energy independence is primarily through the reduction of us dependence on
854133 the united states more than anyone has the technology money and ability to embrace energy conservation renewable resources and alternative energy technologies
854134 i do believe that the rise in cost is primarily due to futures speculation and much less to do with supply demand
854135 this pov has actually nothing to do with e mc2 and pre supposes that humans the american variety in this case cannot adapt to changing economic conditions
854136 what im saying here is that the political argument that the path to us energy independence is primarily through the reduction of us dependence on
854137 the united states more than anyone has the technology money and ability to embrace energy conservation renewable resources and alternative energy technologies
854138 if you cant say anything nice then dont say anything at all
854139 we started off with a head of steam but pricing has come back into line with the performance of both equity and commodity markets on friday mr halliday said
854140 todos somos extensiones del campo universal de energ a distintos puntos de vista de una nica entidad esto implica ver todas las cosas del mundo a todas las personas del mundo y darnos cuenta de que estamos mirando otra versi n de nosotros mismos t y yo somos lo mismo todo es lo mismo todos somos espejos de los dem s y debemos aprender a vernos en el reflejo de las dem s personas a esto se llama espejo de las relaciones a trav s del espejo de una relaci n descubro mi yo no circunscrito por esta raz n el desarrollo de las relaciones es la actividad m s importante de mi vida todo lo que veo a mi alrededor es una expresi n de m mismo las relaciones son una herramienta para la evoluci n espiritual cuya meta ltima es la unidad en la conciencia todos somos inevitablemente parte de la misma conciencia universal pero los verdaderos avances tienen lugar cuando empezamos a reconocer esa conexi n en nuestra vida cotidiana las relaciones son una de las maneras m s efectivas para alcanzar la unidad en la conciencia porque siempre estamos envueltos en relaciones piensa en la red de relaciones que mantienes padres hijos amigos compa eros de trabajo relaciones amorosas todas son en esencia cuando est s enamorado rom ntica y profundamente enamorado tienes una sensaci n de intemporalidad en ese momento est s en paz con la incertidumbre te sientes de maravilla pero vulnerable sientes cercan a pero tambi n desprotecci n est s transform ndote cambiando pero sin miedo te sientes maravillado sa es una experiencia espiritual a trav s del espejo de las relaciones de cada una de ellas descubrimos estados prolongados de conciencia tanto aquellos a quienes amamos como aquellos por quienes sentimos rechazo son espejos de nosotros hacia qui nes nos sentimos atra dos hacia las personas que tienen caracter sticas similares a las nuestras pero eso no es todo queremos estar en su compa a porque subconscientemente sentimos que al hacerlo nosotros podemos manifestar m s de esas caracter sticas del mismo modo sentimos rechazo hacia las personas que nos reflejan las caracter sticas que negamos en nosotros si sientes una fuerte reacci n negativa hacia alguien puedes estar seguro de que t y esa persona tienen caracter sticas en com n caracter sticas que no est s dispuesto a aceptar si las aceptaras no te molestar an cuando reconocemos que podemos vernos en los dem s cada relaci n se convierte en una herramienta para evoluci n de nuestra conciencia gracias a esta evoluci n experimentamos estados extendidos de conciencia la pr xima vez que te sientas atra do por alguien preg ntate qu te atrajo su belleza gracia elegancia autoridad poder o inteligencia cualquier cosa que haya sido s consciente de que esa caracter stica tambi n florece en ti si prestas atenci n a esos sentimientos podr s iniciar el proceso de convertirte en ti m s plenamente lo mismo se aplica a las personas hacia las que sientes rechazo al adoptar m s plenamente tu verdadero yo debes comprender y aceptar tus caracter sticas menos atractivas la naturaleza esencial del universo es la coexistencia de valores opuestos no puedes ser valeroso si no tienes a un cobarde en tu interior no puedes ser generoso si no tienes a un taca o no puedes ser virtuoso si no tienes la capacidad para actuar con maldad gastamos gran parte de nuestras vidas negando este lado oscuro y terminamos proyectando esas caracter sticas oscuras en quienes nos rodean has conocido personas que atraigan sistem ticamente a su vida a los sujetos equivocados normalmente aqu llas no comprenden por qu les sucede esto una y otra vez a o tras a o no es que atraigan esa oscuridad es que no est n dispuestas a aprobarlas en sus propias vidas un encuentro con una persona que no te agrada es una oportunidad para aceptar la paradoja de la coexistencia de los opuestos de descubrir una nueva faceta de ti es otro paso a favor del desarrollo de tu ser espiritual las personas m s esclarecidas del mundo aceptan todo su potencial de luz y oscuridad cuando est s con alguien que reconoce y aprueba sus rasgos negativos nunca te sientes juzgado esto s lo ocurre cuando las personas ven el bien y el mal lo correcto y lo incorrecto como caracter sticas externas cuando estamos dispuestos a aceptar los lados luminoso y oscuro de nuestro ser podemos empezar a curarnos y a curar nuestras relaciones todos somos multidimensionales omnidimensionales todo lo que existe en alg n lugar del mundo tambi n existe en nosotros cuando aceptamos esos distintos aspectos de nuestro ser reconocemos nuestra conexi n con la conciencia universal y expandimos nuestra conciencia personal las caracter sticas que distinguimos m s claramente en los dem s est n presentes en nosotros cuando seamos capaces de ver en el espejo de las relaciones podremos empezar a ver nuestro ser completo para esto es necesario estar en paz con nuestra ambig edad aceptar todos los aspectos de nosotros necesitamos reconocer en un nivel profundo que tener caracter sticas negativas no significa que seamos imperfectos nadie tiene exclusivamente caracter sticas positivas la presencia de caracter sticas negativas s lo significa que estamos completos gracias a esa totalidad podemos acceder m s f cilmente a nuestro ser universal no circunscrito una vez que puedas verte en los dem s ser mucho m s f cil establecer contacto con ellos y a trav s de esa conexi n descubrir la conciencia de la unidad ste es el poder del espejo de las relaciones
854141 there werent any lives he john mark touched that werent made better by his influence
854142 when i woke up the nurses were standing over me and putting smelling salts in front of me
854143 i guess it was the shock we cried a bushel of tears
854144 my cereal is soggy its bushs fault for lowering the standards on whole wheat extraction techniques
854145 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
854146 as a team you watch film on sunday and then you kind of the let the game go
854147 but then i guess going through film in the summer time you kind of realize again just how many stupid little plays here and there could have changed the outcome its really a game of a few plays
854148 what weve got to do is understand that its a 60 minute game and weve got to finish opponents
854149 our kids competed extremely hard last season but we werent good enough to win in the fourth quarter
854150 being able to seize the moment and excel on those plays thats whats going to determine if you win or lose
854151 we didnt do that last year thats what were looking forward to doing this year
854152 i love you boy at the end up this fucked up run we call life i hope that you at least get that out of it that i love you i know im well i know im not the best there is i wish you would have been dealt a better hand really but this is what you got and i hope youre able to do something with it god knows i hope you do better with yours than i did with mine

854157 guys i have to level with you there are people in my party who would like to change the law and it may likely happen in a couple of years that we are going to be like michigan or france in our labor environment
854158 the choice by volkswagen does not come without reciprocal help in the form of incentives from the state and local levels those incentives need to be fully revealed to tennesseans although volkswagen officials say the incentives were not the driving force behind the move and state officials are either being coy or genuinely dont know the full package yet to give details on incentives

854160 se han convertido en un objetivo importante y c modo para los servicios de inteligencia en su b squeda de informaciones
854161 tienes c ncer y te va a llegar r pidamente al cerebro si no nos ayudas
854162 quer an informaciones sobre mi familia y mis vecinos y me dijeron que si no les contaba nada no me dejar an
854163 toda personas que entra en israel debe ser interrogado sobre sus motivaciones y en particular si pertenece a una organizaci n terrorista
854164 si una persona decide entrar en una organizaci n terrorista no tenemos por qu hacerla entrar en israel para un tratamiento m dico hamas tom el poder debe atender a esas personas
854165 estas personas no pueden ayudarnos porque en cuanto entran en gaza son sospechosas de colaboraci n
854166 es como una estrella de rock no tiene sustancia y me asusta es demasiado de izquierdas los asesores de ted kennedy y de jimmy carter le est n llevando la campa a
854167 por qu obama se convirti al cristianismo justo antes de entrar en pol tica en este pa s si eres musulm n no puedes ser presidente
854168 podemos hacer discursos y declaraciones pero lo importante es dialogar con el pueblo americano y obama lo ha rechazado
854169 responder a vuestras preguntas y comentarios e incluso a vuestros insultos bromea para eso estamos
854170 no trabajo para un partido ni para un grupo de inter s trabajo para vosotros y para el pa s al que amo
854171 quiere aumentar el tama o del gobierno y subir los impuestos
854172 si me eleg s presidente mi pa s siempre ser prioritario
854173 this is a small market and there is a larger percent of this country that will never tap into this market
854174 there is no way in the world anyones cut of internet revenue even the studios is going to make up for money lost from the strike
854175 traditional media is not dead and its not going to die any time soon
854176 marketers are looking for more than just the web and we are bringing them back to tv and leveraging online with tv
854177 we have hundreds of local sales experts in media and we are working with them and empowering them with tools and training to learn how to sell this medium
854178 we have 90 brands on our network for the four years we have been doing this
854179 and it takes a lot of work and a lot of trust to get them to write a 50 000 check a 100 000 check and now they are at the stage where they deliver 1 million checks but that is because we have been there with them all along
854180 i think joss whedon could go out and get money but for most people looking at making money content is a bad bet unless you are part of a media company who can diversify its portfolio
854181 video is really one of the key pillars of the investments we are making at msn to improve the online portal experience and we are investing heavily in the platform and technology like silverlight to enable rich video experiences
854182 this is an opportunity for them to showcase key features
854183 it will certainly put silverlight on the map with tens of millions of downloads because of the olympics
854184 while microsoft has validated our message we remain uniquely positioned in our commitment to cross platform technology and focus on user experience
854185 more important than microsofts online video is the fact that four of the largest tech leaders apple adobe microsoft and google are going head to head to grab the video market this arms race will benefit both video producers and consumers immensely
854186 it is important to develop something like this with a lot of consumer insight and feedback
854187 for a long time at verizon we made it clear we were interested in giving customers freedom and flexibility to enjoy exciting content anywhere anytime and on any device
854188 our goal is to reach people in as many places as we can
854189 given how excited consumers seem to be it made sense to try
854190 its hard to know which one will move the needle
854191 we want the public to feel that they can take a stand against this disease we want to move and educate and inspire people to recognize that they have a stake in this issue
854192 everyone whos been through cancer knows you cant get through it without laughter
854193 we said lets all join forces and do it together
854194 if anything else attacked this country and killed 1 500 people a day we wouldnt rest for one minute
854195 youve got a program element that is dominating the airwaves for 18 days it is who we are for that period of time
854196 it makes it worth our while to present the best local and most market oriented coverage we can so were doing it
854197 we will book right up to and through the olympics
854198 it is selling maybe not as fast as it might have been in a less tight economy but its selling well above what regular inventory is doing
854199 las medidas adoptadas por el gobierno se realizan despu s de haber subido en dos ocasiones el precio de la electricidad concretamente en los meses de enero y julio del presente a o por lo que se acumula una subida del 11 y no se descartan nuevos incrementos en el precio para el ltimo trimestre del a o

854205 fox is very lucky to have televisions preeminent performance competitions in american idol and so you think you can dance
854206 its no coincidence that creator and executive producer simon fuller and executive producer and judge nigel lythgoe have been a part of both these successes
854207 this is the 1980s show ben silverman needs to bring back
854208 personally i havent been able to translate the research into communication with my wife or my daughters
854209 we wanted to position ourselves as experts on women in the same way that mtv is expert among the young or nickelodeon is expert among kids
854210 its not like one study to understand the consumer you cant do dipstick research and do one big study a year anymore or even one a quarter so this is kind of a combination we pulled from everything that we do
854211 i think you just have to be constantly in communication with the audience to make sure that youre contemporary and relevant
854212 i think thats the most important thing as we put more shows on the air
854213 i found it to be very useful given the depth of the research that theyve done
854214 if you dont show that you have a certain insight into the target youre not going to be at the top of the list to be included in a media plan
854215 lifetime has to prove continually that theyre relevant and that they are the experts in women because while its their heritage everything is under so much scrutiny now for them to have a study like that shows they are committed to continuing to understand who their core target audience is and developing programming that speaks to those people
854216 i dont think were looking to get the hills younger i dont think were ever going to get 22 year old younger but were going in the right direction
854217 i think we want to portray and attract what the modern woman of today looks like
854218 if you ask them why they dont just give up some of the things theyre doing they look at you like you have three heads being busy is a badge of honor to them
854219 they feel like it makes them a better mom or better executive or a better wife because theyre taking care of themselves
854220 its not about changing the person just changing the way you carry yourself changing the way you feel about yourself
854221 they believe in some combination of getting off the couch not smoking and so on but in the end theres a real paradox they can be overweight but they can feel healthy because they havent eaten fast food in a long time
854222 we have a few shows in development that are trying to get at that
854223 our result relies on dividend income more than the movement in the stock prices he said
854224 of course its been a pretty robust economy in australia while its slowing our results in the bag
854225 were hopeful that there wont be too many cuts but you certainly wont see the sort of growth that youve had in recent years he said
854226 thats our challenge to get around that to work our way through that
854227 were hopeful the banks will just be able to scrape through with steady divs rather than cuts he said
854228 the market is so volatile we are spending bits and pieces but we havent got the confidence to go fully invested given the volatility he said
854229 we still need to get to the bottom of this global credit crisis
854230 while thats the case i think its wise to have a good pool of cash
854231 we accept tibet as part of the peoples republic of china
854232 for the future of tibet i have decided to find a solution within the framework of the peoples republic of china
854233 genuine spiritual and cultural autonomy and a degree of political space
854234 there is no reason to believe that a violent uprising in tibet will succeed

854242 anti americanism has always been a topic of discussion in western europe even a common one especially among the intelligentsia but the reign of george w bush gave a patina of legitimacy to european prejudices and brought into line the attitudes of intellectuals politicians and the masses against the united states and made ridiculing bush a habit in cafes and eateries in the bush era the american century plumbed its lowest depths and anti americanism became the new global religion

854253 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
854254 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
854255 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness says the monk who resides in a monastery of the order of friars minor capuchin in stalowa wola southern poland
854256 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life

854267 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench

854281 perhaps most importantly however the report highlighted the role that every aspect of society law enforcement the private sector business community educators parents kids and the general public have in combating crimes involving the internet said bill hutchison chair of kinsa the very foundation of kinsa a charity we founded in the spirit of public and private collaboration to combat the sexual exploitation of children on the internet is one that seeks to bring all these groups together
854282 this report cannot be left on a shelf to collect dust it should serve as a clarion call to governments at all levels across canada as well as to the private sector that action is needed to address these crimes
854283 the report is written as an action plan kinsa will continue to do its part as a not for profit advocate and as a group who can break down public private or international boundaries faster and more effectively than government can we hope that were joined in these efforts

854539 i particularly love this recipe because of the wonderful memory this recipe evokes my daughter mei picked the thyme from her own little herb garden and we made the recipe together she may be only 18 months old but to see her enjoy the activity means the world to a first time dad i think adding fresh herbs like thyme is a quick way to transform meals not only does it help with adding flavor it allows me to cut back on flavor enhancing ingredients like salt fat and sugar take some thyme pun intended to cook with thyme

854635 in essence bets on which way the oil price will move
854636 neither index funds nor other speculators ever buy any physical oil
854637 instead they buy futures and options which they settle with a cash payment when they the options contracts fall due since the real currency of such contracts is cash rather than barrels of crude there is no limit to the number of bets that can be made and since no oil is ever held back from the market these bets do not affect the price of oil any more than bets on a football match affect the result
854638 despite their dismal reputation oil speculators provide a vital service they help airlines and other big oil consumers to hedge against rising prices and so to reduce risk a massive boon amid the economic turmoil

854643 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
854644 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
854645 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
854646 im excited its good to have him back in the house
854647 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
854648 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
854649 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
854650 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
854651 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
854652 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

854677 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
854678 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
854679 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
854680 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organising committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver

854700 as people drink less beer than they used to they also look for better more flavoured beers people are turning back to ales now
854701 in a year that saw the british beer market suffer such hefty decline fullers actually grew its volume last year
854702 we are seeing a resurgence of english ales and english cask ales because people are looking for more personality and character in their beer
854703 people were enamoured of this new beer style that was sold in flashy cans it was served colder you never had a bad pint but you never had a good pint so people flocked to it
854704 and maybe women saw it as more glamorous than a pint of real ale
854705 sales are falling because four global breweries have more than 80 percent of the uk beer market and all they seem to produce these days are global beer brands that youll find anywhere in the world so its very boring
854706 the only breweries that seem to be brewing more beer now than before that are seeing their sales rise are the smallest breweries
854707 there are 600 microbreweries in the uk and 35 family brewers this sector of the market is very active

854713 please screen the most active newsgroup discussions before you feature them after reading the thread about multiple body tags i am very wary of ever asking a question that one of those mvps might want to tell me is stupid
854714 no one ever did bother to ask what dawg found valuable about being able to have multiple body tags regardless of the fact that frontpage is not designed to allow it assuming that there was an alternative solution without checking with him what he really wanted to do the resulting incivility was unpleasant to watch
854715 this is a sample for changing the text on the status bar
854716 the da needs to prosecute this little whore but they wont because in every das office throughout the country it is filled with man hating short hair dykes this is true just walk into any das office and see who works there many men get falsely accused of things they never did because little sluts want to get even it costs innocent guys time and money to deal with this men need to get organized to force these wothless das to do something and avoid little sluts who play the victim
854717 we all recognise that this is a legitimate artform we know that its a big business we know that there are a whole variety of different games that are played by a whole variety of different people of different ages but when you talk to some sections of the community and certainly when you talk to a lot of politicians they kind of dont get it
854718 we really are in a bit of a fight for legitimacy at present so it is very often the case that we have to be explaining what this industry is and really kind of dealing with a whole lot of stereotypes about videogames and about the people that play videogames so thats definitely a priority and yeah its a bit of a battle
854719 this cultural argument is the only thing that the film industry has left to cling to
854720 any person with any kind of interest in videogames must have looked at the abcs
854721 dont think for a second that politicians dont read web forums and opinion pieces

854736 there is a detainee review process in place which judges security risk so that at any point in that process detainees can be retained or released
854737 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
854738 i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
854739 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
854740 i dont even want to dignify that with a response the police always had enormous respect for my privacy they understood it was very difficult for me to live in a house with four strangers it is an obscenity to suggest that i asked people to leave the room so that i could have sex with my girlfriend i will not have that said about me
854741 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action

854760 it suddenly opened my eyes to the fundamentalism that is getting entrenched in christianity across the world in brazil south korea africa and also in india
854761 chennai is today considered the fastest growing hub of christianity in south asia
854762 fundamentalism as a counter culture protestants in urban south india
854763 belong to a global umma and harbour real and perhaps imagined longings directed towards making all of gods people christian
854764 christianity in india and begin going to the media more
854765 politics of mis recognition certainly applies to christian broadcasting in india
854766 in india itself there are more than 500 000 villages that have never heard about jesus there is neither a church nor has any missionary been in these parts our responsibility as the chosen one of god is to make an opportunity for these people so that they too can hear the word of god
854767 new meaning for religion and politics simultaneously mixing the religious with business and finance creating spectacular events and media personalities
854768 liberal christians along with many others in india certainly have serious misgivings about this kind of aggressive proselytisation
854769 the traditional church is however reluctant to admit it and take action against this especially in the face of rising hindu and islamic fundamentalism
854770 t he governor is sovereign ex officio holder of the power who acts on his own personal satisfaction and not on the aid and advice of the council of ministers the member of the legislative council may be explained that he does not enjoy the powers to question the decisions of the body
854771 the yearning for moksha salvation can move the devotees to the challenging heights of kashmir and will be a fitting gesture of solidarity with our valiant soldiers who have been fighting the enemy to defend our borders
854772 the yatris during their amarnath yatra do not only defecate on the banks of the lidder river but throw tonnes of non degradable items like polythene plastic items directly into the river this has resulted in the deterioration of its water quality
854773 t he chemical oxygen demand of the lidder has been recorded between 17 and 92 mg l which is beyond the permissible level such enriched waters with hazardous chemicals ranges can no way be recommended for potable purposes it has crossed all permissible limits due to flow of sewage and open defecation lidder has been turned into a cesspool
854774 the population of india will increase we will have to consider further extension of the yatra period
854775 look nothing happened to us and nothing will happen to us you be aware of our strength
854776 we will not allow madhya pradesh to become another gujarat
854777 the matter complained of must be read as a whole one cannot rely on strongly worded and isolated passages for proving the charge nor indeed can one take a sentence here and a sentence there and connect them by a meticulous process of inferential reasoning
854778 it is the sole responsibility of the state to make positive efforts to resolve every possible conflict between any of the communities castes or religions within the state and try every possible way to establish peace and harmony within the state under every and all circumstances
854779 as a dangerous piece of legislation and has been impolitic among other reasons by necessitating government to side with or to appear to side with one party as against another in my humble judgment it will only accentuate the evil which it is meant to remove far from healing the differences which still linger or which now and then come to the surface it would widen the gap by encouraging insidious men to do mischief in stealth
854780 we get many cases where couples inform us they are getting married but it is not possible that plainclothes policemen would visit their house
854781 in the past the bombay high court has had to extend a helping hand to newly married couples of an inter community marriage when they were harassed by partisan and prejudiced government officers
854782 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
854783 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
854784 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
854785 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
854786 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
854787 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
854788 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
854789 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
854790 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
854791 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

854806 you have been asking for an official solution to the peripheral crisis where makeshift devices such as tupperware have failed to provide solutions that replicate the wii s perfect design we have devised a device that will not only enhance the wii itself but provide a non obtrusive design fit for gamers across all ages
854807 we feel the wiibox solution will enhance the satisfaction our consumers get out of our system
854808 it highlights the concern we have for our consumers and our ability to provide such a solution to them that is not directly related to playing games like wiisports or wiiresort
854809 with the average american family having roughly two children this can quickly add up to a number of wii periperhals

855108 it is strange that reliance has recorded a lower growth in refinery margins it is much below the markets expectations
855109 refineries with lower complexity like the state owned refineries cannot sustain the high margins it is bound to moderate to around 10 per barrel in the rest of the year
855110 the higher inventory gains for the state owned refineries could be a result of them having more term contracts where the price of the oil is fixed but the price of petroleum products the refineries sell rise in line with international prices reliance has fewer term contracts
855111 we had to tighten the borrowing norms due to rising delinquency rates recently
855112 we are entering a difficult period where finance availability has become a problem
855113 we had raised prices during the first quarter april june which had saved our margins we will have to look at more price hikes to balance the rise in input costs

855122 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
855123 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
855124 the scientific community is really going to run with this
855125 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
855126 it is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense not only in proportion to their revenue but something more than in that proportion

855128 as several sightings were made in and around washington dc of dragonflies hovering low in the air at political events government agencies were denying that they had released any tiny surveilance robots according to a washington post investigation
855129 but these are not insects and ive never seen them before another antiwar activist says they look like dragonflies but dont move like them and says he has seen them at three rallies in a row but nowhere else many more claim to have seen them always at antiwar rallies but havent elaborated several agencies admit to having tried to develop such devices mostly in relation to terrorist cells and illicit drugs but deny having gotten any off the ground
855130 i heard someone say oh my god look at those
855131 i look up and im like what the hell is that they looked kind of like dragonflies or little helicopters but i mean those are not insects
855132 you cant make a conventional robot of metal and ball bearings and just shrink the design down
855133 you might recall that gandalf the friendly wizard in the recent classic lord of the rings used a moth to call in air support

855141 i dont want people to get paranoid but what can i say
855142 cellphone cameras are already everywhere its not that much different
855143 we start with a system that works delfly i but which on has only forward flight and make it smaller and better delfly ii is smaller and more robust has longer flight time is able to hover take off and land vertically can even fly backwards it can fly against the ceiling and walls without crashing all this with a camera on board so it is a useful platform
855144 developing the electronics battery camera controls thats the hardest part
855145 flying outdoors is no problem if the wind is higher than the max forward velocity you float with the wind like insects do to go from one spot to the other delfly ii is a inherent stable platform so flying outdoors with gusts is no problem if you stop steering delfly ii will simply assume a stable position
855146 democrats refuse to even leave the lights on for debating offshore drilling despite 70 of americans supporting the measure
855147 also even with the ever increasing price of crude it still is not cost effective to drill for oil in some places to complicate matters further because of a lack of supply and a rapidly growing demand there is not enough equipment available for all the potential drilling sites energy experts also acknowledge that some oil companies hold onto leases to prevent competitors from drilling on them
855148 the difference being your union cant fire you if you dont vote their way
855149 the union is like having herpes it doesnt kill you but its unpleasant and inconvenient and it stops a lot of people from becoming your lover unions as they evolved in the united states became very adversarial untrusting and opposed to the success and prosperity of the business this is my major objection to unions today they harm the flourishing of the business for all the stakeholders instead of cooperation between stakeholders they focus on competition between management and labor instead of embracing the notion of the expanding pie vision of capitalism more for everyone or win win they frequently embrace the zero sum philosophy of win lose
855150 yea yea yea just like the codes on any other kind of

855152 the current retransmission agreement between nbc24 wnwo tv and buckeye cable was set to expire at midnight tonight july 31 2008 we continue to negotiate with buckeye on a new agreement it does not appear that an agreement can be reached before the deadline as a courtesy to buckeye subscribers and as a demonstration of good faith in our negotiations nbc24 will extend retransmission consent through the end of the summer olympic games sunday august 24 to allow all viewers to enjoy this historic event it is our hope that we can conclude a new agreement soon

855218 we are moving forward on this and trying to come in on a unified front im very happy that alderman teeboom and myself have been working together on this partnership this to me has been a success story
855219 were making a lot of headway and really getting our arms around this immense project
855220 in my opinion it would be a true disservice to the voters who took the time to carefully consider the pros and cons of the original parkway referendum to move forward based on that vote with a project that doesnt even closely resemble what those voters had initially thought they were voting for
855221 let me state for the record that i am not generally an advocate of referendums but in this case it seems fair to say that the people who voted on the original project are not getting what they voted for
855222 the board of aldermen chose in 1997 to give the citizens a say on this project as such we should stand by that commitment and give citizens a voice on the different plan that sits before us today
855223 and significantly alderman plamondon who is a proponent of building the broad street parkway

855252 our intent is to raise 150 000 pounds of fresh produce on the farm annually and make it available first and foremost locally in the mad river valley and washington county and then also to other food shelves and pantries around the state
855253 its a way for us to sustain a sustainable source of fresh produce for the people we serve often times its the fresh produce that doesnt make its way into the shopping cart of needy vermonters because its unaffordable so they lose access and they lose the nutrient value of produce in their diet
855254 this farm is right on route 100 its got great access for people to see and drive past and its a gateway to the mad river valley
855255 my feeling has always been that were not taking business from local farmers because the pie is getting bigger as people realize the importance of eating locally
855256 its increasingly unaffordable for us to take fresh produce from outside the state so we need to gather as much locally as we can the short term gain is significant and the long term gain is well continue to have the fresh produce and the educational opportunities to better understand the issue of hunger
855257 youre saving on gas youre cutting out the middle man youre producing it as cheaply as possible and itll give you the food you want its a win win win situation
855258 this is well within the realm of the sorts of things weve been supportive of but i just dont know how competitive the next round of funding will be

855295 lebanese officials from the president down had always legitimized hizbullahs resistance as a national cause
855296 this time a vehemently anti hizbullah government led by a majority that has significant western support has put its signature to a clause that allows hizbullah to take actions in the fields listed without seeking government approval
855297 it also puts an end to any dreams of disarming hizbullah it secures hizbullahs armed existence
855298 the right of lebanon its people army and resistance to liberate or recover the occupied shaba farms mount dov kafr shuba hills and the lebanese sector of ghajar village and to defend lebanon against any aggression by all legitimate and available means
855299 the resistance is not the exclusive privilege of the resistance hizbullah but essentially the responsibility of the state

855301 i hope a new version taking into consideration this reservation will be reached before the government adopts the statement
855302 it is ambiguous enough to make everybody feel that they have gained as it can be interpreted in many ways

855313 behold i am the handmaid of the lord let it be done to me according to your word
855314 being obedient she became the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole human race
855315 the knot of eves disobedience was untied by marys obedience what the virgin eve bound through her disbelief mary loosened by her faith
855316 the virgin mary is acknowledged and honored as being truly the mother of god and of the redeemer she is clearly the mother of the members of christ since she has by her charity joined in bringing about the birth of believers in the church who are members of its head
855317 we also see mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the spirit who had already overshadowed her in the annunciation
855318 finally the immaculate virgin preserved free from all stain of original sin when the course of her earthly life was finished was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory and exalted by the lord as queen over all things so that she might be the more fully conformed to her son the lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death
855319 in a wholly singular way she cooperated by her obedience faith hope and burning charity in the saviors work of restoring supernatural life to souls for this reason she is a mother to us in the order of grace
855320 this motherhood of mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation therefore the blessed virgin is invoked in the church under the titles of advocate helper benefactress and mediatrix
855321 marys function as mother of men in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of christ but rather shows its power but the blessed virgins salutary influence on men flows forth from the superabundance of the merits of christ rests on his mediation depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it
855322 no creature could ever be counted along with the incarnate word and redeemer but just as the priesthood of christ is shared in various ways both by his ministers and the faithful and as the one goodness of god is radiated in different ways among his creatures so also the unique mediation of the redeemer does not exclude but rather gives rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one source
855323 the churchs devotion to the blessed virgin is intrinsic to christian worship
855324 the blessed virgin with special devotion from the most ancient times the blessed virgin has been honored with the title of mother of god to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs this very special devotion differs essentially from the adoration which is given to the incarnate word and equally to the father and the holy spirit and greatly fosters this adoration
855325 in the glory of the most holy and undivided trinity

855351 no tienes que ser excelente para empezar pero tienes que empezar para ser excelente

855395 we are helping mondal to tie up with the hero group and are also in touch with the ministry of rural development to roll out his invention
855396 as stewardship of the environment takes on an ever increasing importance for the global community we have seen great promise for such inventions to increase energy efficiency save precious resources and reduce pollution
855397 so that it is not out of place in a metro

855405 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
855406 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
855407 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
855408 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
855409 using force is ugly but if you dont do that youll have a violent felon running around
855410 we do things people in an office or store or hospital dont have to do
855411 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
855412 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
855413 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
855414 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
855415 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
855416 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020
855417 ive started taking fewer trips out to see him but i stay for longer periods of time

855424 were now able to announce ibms branded versions of the filesx technology
855425 there are also some tweaks here and there to improve the integration with tsm
855426 its to improve the ability of tsm to kick off backups for data protection
855427 its an enterprise class product but filesx will push it more into the mid market
855428 filesx has been used by small to medium sized companies primarily and some of their larger customers use them for remote office backups
855429 so this could now be an integrated component of tsm
855430 its almost instant recovery of data for applications used in the windows environment
855431 its going to range from 800 per server to 3000 per server
855432 its at least until the end of their maintenance contracts and then they will be encouraged to move
855433 each of us has a body clock which has a trough at certain times of day and at other times a peak for the average person the trough is about 4am and the peak around 7pm or 8pm a lark would get up about an hour earlier than average be the life and soul of the breakfast table and then start flaking as the day progresses an owl probably gets up an hour later than average and starts to feel better later in the day going to bed an hour or two later than average
855434 they tend to be more larkish as children becoming much more owlish throughout adolescence and at their most owlish in their early twenties in old age they become more of a lark again so its down to age and habit and to a lesser extent genes
855435 we found that people with a long version of period 3 were much more likely to be morning types and those with the short version were likely to be evening types
855436 its simply that there tended to be more morning people who had the long version
855437 and thats early nights however good the party you have to leave im in bed at 9pm come hell or high water
855438 in summer when the suns already up i open the windows wide and do a bit of yoga
855439 i like waking up to the nice scottish burr of rhod sharp on radio 5 live
855440 they showed signs of being much more tired and also showed a dramatic fall in cognitive performance
855441 the owl is more adaptable and more able to be a lark larks are more rigid in behaviour
855442 if flowers on your nightstand make you want to sing a song then great but this is more a behavioural phenomenon than a physiological one you might be an owl at 20 but when you have children youll be forced into being a lark basically youve just got to do it
855443 broad interest events are when we see spikes in traffic which is the perfect time for hackers and cybercriminals to do their bidding
855444 the increasing number of compromised sites during these times presents a greater opportunity of host infection on the client side

855447 if you dont have a web filtering solution this is difficult to enforce
855448 making sure that your security solution is updated and enforcing your acceptable use policy with regards to prevention will help ensure that youre safe
855449 i dont think the online traffic for sporting events is high enough to matter that much to the average firms network performance

855451 i knew i was suffering from arthritis for the past two years but after a thorough checkup i was told i also suffer from osteoporosis
855452 the orthopaedic surgeon told me that bone degeneration was eating into my hip bone
855453 he prescribed medication to slow down the degeneration i will be keeping in touch with the doctor through email about my condition
855454 i am impressed with the high quality and affordable state of the art medical facilities and services i am happy with the service and hope to come back in three months for a follow up check up
855455 mhc can serve as a one stop destination for all medical and tourism related needs for bangladeshis bringing together all related service providers in malaysia on a single platform
855456 we need to promote ourselves aggressively in order to compete with other asean countries most of the patients visiting malaysia come from indonesia and singapore
855457 we have people from some 34 countries visiting our website many of them come to malaysia because of long waiting lists at hospitals in their own countries and because it is more affordable
855458 we act as a one stop centre people find it convenient as they dont have to go through all the hassle the cake is huge if we market our services properly we will be able to attract more foreign patients
855459 i tried taking a step and felt i couldnt put any pressure on it
855460 theres no setback or anything like that the move gets an arm in the bullpen which is the most important thing
855461 we have to establish the run weve just got to
855462 that has to be our goal we have no other choice
855463 coach colletto loves to run it to death and thats what i did in college its the same system we ran in college so im going to keep running as hard as i can for as long as they want me to
855464 ive watched adrian since he was at oklahoma and to me hes an inspiration
855465 hes a different type of back than i would say i am but when i watch him and i see him make moves and do things on that level i have no doubt that i can do that on this level
855466 he had a big college career and me im coming off last years big performance if i did anything but something similar to what he did last year for me it will be a disappointment
855467 we have the means and the will the event continues on schedule and the man will burn on saturday night
855468 the shift in the preference has got a lot to do with the fall of the dollar against major global currencies over the past few years there is also a thrust on moving from low yielding assets to high yielding assets and that would involve diversification of the dollar but the shift could be more towards euro and currencies in the sdr basket than to other currencies however among other currencies there could be an interest in the yuan as china is emerging as a large trading partner for many countries

855480 even though they the sec would never admit it patrick byrne helped instruct them in the danger when the time came they understood the threat
855481 what i dont understand is why the sec is only addressing fannie mae freddie mac and the large investment banks why should those companies be the only ones protected
855482 we know it has been going on and that its been harmful to share prices
855483 one of the big concerns we have is that depositors often can not distinguish the difference between a stock price dropping and the safety of their deposits and soundness of their bank
855484 rather than fixing any of the real problems with the agency and its mission cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short selling it made a big noise but theres no dead bug
855485 byrne has said that the secs politically motivated pandering means that he has won the intellectual argument on naked short selling
855486 but there hasnt been an intellectual argument there has been a campaign of intimidation and personal attacks against critics of his poor management of his company and his naked shorting jihad
855487 what theyre saying is that if he only ran a better liquor store he wouldnt get robbed as much
855488 then she mentioned about how shed read about all the horrible things i was doing and how it appeared like id gone completely off the deep end
855489 as we sat down he said patrick i want you to know that you have become the most hated man ive ever known in all my life here in new york

855495 for what its worth i think that while solzhenitsyn was wrong to excuse and overlook the crimes of czarist russia he was right to emphasize that the oppression of the soviet union was rooted more in communist ideology and institutions than in russian cultural tradition
855496 its probably going to shorten our trip because the kids cant really get on the equipment
855497 it causes so much problems they are unable to walk and their reaction is to fall down and some of them pass out
855498 we see those kids every day especially last week at a significantly higher rate
855499 were going to think twice before going out because its so hot
855500 they contacted him he tried to walk away continued to walk into traffic
855501 they were convinced that he was a danger to himself and others
855502 we want to play our part but in order to have a democratic society you need laws on one hand and law enforcement on the other hand
855503 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
855504 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal

855519 i have frequently seen a poet withdraw having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm while the crusty farmer supposed that he got a few wiled apples only the poet to the farmers farm has fairly impounded it skimmed it and got all the cream leaving the farmer with only the skimmed milk
855520 a formidable swordswoman budding tactician and shrewd critical thinker but still a youngling when she is sent to the front lines to aid anakin skywalker who is leading the clones against an army of droids
855521 george wanted anakin to have a padawan and its just great that weve introduced not only a padawan to anakin but a new female character she is feisty shes got a great personality she has a really strong sense of herself and she challenges anakin to think differently so while she has been put in place to learn from anakin he also learns a lot from her and she is somebody that i think kids and particularly girls can relate to shes a really fantastic mentor type character
855522 in the star wars films theres a tradition of someone being taken on an amazing journey and learning to become a jedi luke was a farm boy swept up in the rebel alliance anakin was a little boy on tatooine in the clone wars anakin is no longer a padawan hes a jedi
855523 we needed a character who could add the dynamic that a student brings to the story and thats when we came up with the idea of ahoska
855524 i had always wanted to explore the idea of a padawan for anakin but didnt have time in the live action movies we bounced back and forth on a lot of ideas about her would she be human or alien male or female we thought a girl would be just more fun to have in the story and ahsoka takes on that role of the younger person who is being taught which is vital to the star wars movies
855525 we come across anakin and obi wan stranded in this big battle without many supplies and all they get sent to them is this young girl
855526 shes a devoted student of the jedi ways headstrong enthusiastic and eager to prove herself to master skywalker but she has yet to learn the finer points of diplomacy and timing
855527 we always felt it was important to have a character whose temperament is somewhere between anakins and
855528 anakin will just jump in anywhere while obi wan wants to think things through before taking action ahsoka appreciates anakins brashness but admires patience and thoughtfulness she has a lot to learn from both of them but is strong and capable in her own right so she sometimes surprises anakin with her approach to the kinds of situations they find themselves in she makes a great counterpoint to anakin visually in her personality her attitude she sort of drives him crazy but he grows very attached to her as youll see in the movie
855529 when princess leia joins luke hes been hanging out with han solo and chewbacca these two roughnecks
855530 she immediately takes charge on the death star saying i dont know who you are or where you come from but from now on you do as i say and then to chewbacca will somebody get this walking carpet out of my way she brought a lot of fun to the movie and for us ahsoka is very similar you can throw her in with obi wan and anakin who think pretty highly of themselves and now they have this young girl in there now who is saying yeah but im going to do things my way its fun to have that sort of banter back in star wars
855531 when we brought on ashley to do the voice of ahsoka she brought such a part of herself to it
855532 shes fantastic she is a lot like ahsoka and the combination of her voice with the visuals just came together beautifully she helped shape the character
855533 ashley naturally nailed it every time and helped make ahsoka a likable interesting and really refreshing young female character

855574 a patient in a gene therapy experiment died on tuesday in what may have been a reaction to a novel treatment for arthritis federal health officials said late yesterday
855575 a doctor cant force anything on a patient who is competent to make medical decisions and refuses care the idea of consent as a patients right goes back at least to 1914 when benjamin cardozo who would later become a supreme court justice ruled in a new york
855576 users of the prescription cholesterol medicine zetia and vytorin received some troubling news from the makers of the drug today although the pills theyre taking lower their cholesterol there is no evidence that they reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes and may in fact be putting them at risk
855577 a national study that included two detroit trauma centers last year is among about 25 no consent studies since the u s food and drug administration began allowing researchers to conduct medical experiments without getting patient permission in 1996 the idea was that some potentially lifesaving research wasnt being done because the patient was unconscious
855578 he felt were in store for years to come caplan responded
855579 technology is moving in biomedicine at an incredibly fast pace on many different fronts ten years ago bioethics was dealing with the last gasp technologies produced by mid 20th century research the icu the blockbuster drug the dialysis machine that is no longer the case investments in genomics the neurosciences bioengineering nanotechnology genetic engineering bioagriculture and imaging technologies are starting to produce it is very clear that the 21st century will be the age of the life sciences where new knowledge of our genes brains and physiology will confront us with incredible choices and challenges
855580 rats and mice get greater protection as research subjects in the united states than do humans
855581 animal research centers have to register with the federal government keep track of subject numbers have unannounced spot inspections and address problems speedily or risk closing none of which is true in human research
855582 because no one collects the data systematically there is no way to tell how safe the nations clinical research is or ever has been
855583 when a bridge collapses in an american city or a mine implodes it does not take long before government gets in motion to figure out what to do about the problem we see the carnage and demand action
855584 allowing northfield laboratories inc to test its blood substitute without the consent of the trauma patients who often are unconscious
855585 the fda beyond all comprehension of a possible rationale approved northfields multi site trial at 31 medical centers in december 2003 under the stewardship of dr mark mcclellan when the agency had knowledge that the product caused heart attacks in patients in a prior unpublished clinical trial whose results have remained concealed ten of 81 patients who received the fake blood suffered a heart attack within seven days and two of those died none of the 71 patients in the trial who received real blood were found to have had a heart attack whats more the fda remained silent as the company continued to hide this vital information from physicians conducting the trial from patients and the public is approaching criminal behavior
855586 blood substitutes made with hemoglobin as a starting point are associated with heart attacks and strokes
855587 after concluding that all the blood substitutes he evaluated were toxic
855588 fdas waiver of informed consent rule was first applied in 1998 by baxter international competitor to northfeld when it conducted a similar trial to test its blood substitute hemassist without informed consent the baxter trial was stopped when 24 of 52 patients given the blood substitute died compared to 8 of 46 who had real blood this lethal experiment demonstrates that waiver of informed consent opens the gate to medical disasters at the same time northfeld was conducting its own abdominal aortic aneurism trial on surgical patients who underwent elective surgery to repair it these patients were able to give informed consent after the suspension of the baxter trial the fda ordered northfeld to expand its trial at 21 medical centers to a voluntary patient base of 600 from 240 in august 2001 that trial was abruptly suspended without the company ever disclosing the results not even to participating trial investigators northfield restricted access to the full data thereby keeping the participating doctors in the dark about the heart attacks and other serious adverse events
855589 these events occurred in 54 of the polyheme patients versus 28 in the control group overall eight polyheme patients died versus four on the conventional therapy
855590 the adverse event profile in the aneurysm trial while significant was not a show stopper
855591 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
855592 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
855593 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
855594 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
855595 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
855596 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
855597 and toby the fearless adventure soldier has in just three minutes climbed the mountain and he has now to find his way through the snow drifts that might hide a bottomless chasm and yes hes done it dodging the sudden avalanche that could have ended his game
855598 again toby has secured the dinghy and is beginning the hazardous journey down the dangerous river oh he was nearly tipped out of the dinghy by that unexpected white water and only just managed to scramble ashore before the waterfall although im not sure this adventure soldiers choice of fire was much use there
855599 now for the most dangerous part of all the jungle hot steamy and full of man eating animals and plants but he soon eliminates the snakes and sees off the tiger oh very clever he sets fire to the huge tooth filled jaws of the plant and another success his score is high at this point
855600 you have got to get around and between some of the rocks and take out the correct ones or youll fail this test there are clues as to the right ones but just as many false leads play it very very carefully tobe
855601 toby the adventure soldier is leading his troops into battle oooh a nasty move there watch out for that marauder ooops five of his granite warriors have successful broken down their defences and its a goal oh sorry wrong game thats right tobe smash them now time is running out and there are still marauders coming from all sides quick toby theres two behind you
855602 i definitely phoned jones services about our little trouble and left a message on their answer phone
855603 i had heard that we arent the only ones belches supermarket chain are having to close the faffingly store until further notice because of you know whats
855604 well thats as may be but we need something done now
855605 youve decided to honour us all with your presence what have we done to deserve it dodd
855606 whatve you done to bernie the hoodie what was there in yer pocket that bit him
855607 becauth of his tongue ith all purple and covered in warths
855608 gerroff yarby its nothing to do with me perhaps bernies caught the plague
855609 poor bernie the purple tongue plague do you think well cath it too
855610 let me think purple tongue yeah ive heard of it
855611 den we thud go and thee a docthur oh denny
855612 what was all that about and whats this purple tongue plague stuff
855613 but supposing a bite from your beetle really is dangerous i mean not a plague but something terrible
855614 kylie looked it up on a web site but couldnt find anything about a blue and black speckled beetle with a long purple tongue
855615 the oldies my parents and matts mum think matts in london
855616 eat up all your carrots and then youll be able to see in the dark
855617 if alf grimley got on a bus three days after he was reported missing then he must still be alive
855618 this could have something to do with matthew disappearing i think we should go right now to wood street
855619 damnedest thing let him out of the house for a tinkle never came back so big
855620 the names rowena spludge i live at number 69 keep your peepers open for him
855621 jonquil jonquil i have a juicy bone for my sweetie pie jonquil come here
855622 matthew mum says youve to come down for your tea
855623 if you dont come out right now im going to tell mum
855624 i dont think there is anything else we can do
855625 its got something to do with that old call centre that burnt down
855626 right well try there there might still be something weve missed
855627 is it something to do with what you told us
855628 are they aliens from outer space wheres their space ship
855629 and you think something happened to matt when we were at that house in wood street last friday
855630 but how did these shadow things get from here to wood street in the first place
855631 alf grimley must have taken them to his house probably without realising what he was doing
855632 he did but it was already too late for him and his wife
855633 i um i found something when i was looking in the grimleys house
855634 ah yes a wannabee detective so what did you find
855635 it got screwed up so i chucked it away so that means
855636 the grimleys havent been murdered or their bodies buried somewhere
855637 the grimleys theyre not here so where are they now
855638 matthew was looking in through the broken window of the grimleys house the other day you all were but i noticed matthew stayed at the window longer than any of you one of the yelloweye wisplurkers and i can imagine it was myers must have attached himself to your brother and was taken back to your home i dont suppose anyone noticed how many shadows matthew had after you left the house
855639 no well i think if you had you might have seen he had two or even more
855640 did he complain of feeling tired or dizzy did he seem different or was he acting strange
855641 yes he went to bed very early and mum thought he was sickening for something
855642 if the wisplurker was attached to matthew or matthews shadow it would start to drain him of his energy and if the creature took your brothers shadow to eat then without it matthew would slowly disappear
855643 thats all im prepared to tell you about their evil but what i can tell you is the name of the redeyes leader he comes from the dark echo and his name is brack hes known as the most feared one and even his followers barely whisper his name except behind closed doors to every wisplurker whether redeye or yelloweye brack is much worse than anything even the dull hes the very devil
855644 shouldnt we go back to the empty house in wood street if these yelloweyes have his shadow and are trapped in there
855645 this is a police matter so i am going back to wood street right now to check a few things out
855646 i want you to all go home and leave this to wicid we know how to deal with this
855647 i know how you must be feeling you want to help your brother but it would be better if you went home if you give me your address and phone number ill call your folks when we know anything
855648 dont ever go near 35 wood street again it could be dangerous for all of you understand
855649 mr private eye toby dodd meet me back here say thursday next after school and well compare notes
855650 dont tell me its parent power youve got to do what they say go where they want do this do that lloydee i dare yer
855651 im going to do some detecting here this is where it all started and im going to have a good look round
855652 where the devil are you never mind get back here doncha know weve got a crisis on
855653 im going out for some juice do you need some
855654 no dont tell me just come on and help your mother and me load up the car
855655 theres at least ten in the kitchen and your mother has just found three in the bathroom or should i say they found her when she was having a shower i think it was her screeches that set them off
855656 no son not a holiday exactly your mother has decided we must get some one in to deal with
855657 the infestation the odd looking cockroaches shes left a message on jones services answer phone so hopefully they can do something in the next couple of days meanwhile were going to stop with your nan
855658 now dont argue well be fine for a few days i know itll be a bit squashed at your nans but
855659 whats happened to my trainers the ones in the bottom of my wardrobe
855660 why you need to keep those old things after we bought you a new pair just last week beats me
855661 have you heard of the wisplurkers the dull and brack the most feared redeye from the dark echo
855662 toby its not another one of those computer games from mr wongs is it
855663 i do think they are a waste of money you soon tire of them and want the next and you have so many games already
855664 the wisplurkers are real and they came from the old call centre you know the one that got fired you know theres the yelloweye they are meant to be quite stupid but they eat human shadows then theres the redeye and theyre not stupid and they kill all the yelloweye wisplurkers they live in dark corners and theyre scared of the dull and brack hes the redeye leader
855665 what an imagination takes after your great uncle archibald the relative no one mentions you know
855666 toby what are you talking about you havent been sniffing something you shouldnt have you
855667 no dad of course not its the truth inspector dalrimple was telling us all about them me matt and lloydee matts disappeared because of the wisplurkers
855668 i blame all these films they show on telly some of them are enough to give you the heebie jeebies
855669 and when a child is as sensitive as our darling toby they can do such terrible harm we are going to have to check what sort of things hes watching from now on jeff
855670 you are not having it whatever it is we spend enough money on your latest must haves
855671 i think somebody has been having you and your friends on this inspector i suppose he was a police inspector he probably spun you a yarn to get you and your friends out of his hair
855672 i hope you checked his warrant card ill not have you talking to strangers what have i told you about that
855673 policemen are busy people toby anyway as for matt jameson disappearing his mother phoned us the other night she thinks he may have gone to stay with his dad whos living in london now and hell be back in time for school tomorrow so lets not hear any more of your fancy tales
855674 we got out before they fastened us in with their planks of wood didnt we
855675 we need their shadows so you know what to do
855676 if the wisplurker was attached to matthew or matthews shadow it would start to drain him of his energy and if the creature took your brothers shadow to eat then without it matthew would slowly disappear
855677 that depends on whether the wisplurker has already eaten his shadow or whether hes keeping it for later some have been known to hoard humans shadows for weeks
855678 how do you know all this and no one else
855679 because wicid has been formed to combat this menace so ive learnt all i can about the wisplurkers i know that if matthews shadow is still intact and it can be attached to the boys clothes in time then its possible he will reappear and be just like he was before hell think he was just asleep and he wont remember anything else
855680 if as this young man has said he found a bus ticket that can prove alf grimley caught a bus days after he supposedly disappeared that means he may or may not be ok ive heard nothing theres been no report of him or his wife being seen recently or my department would have been informed immediately
855681 thousands i suppose however many unanswered calls there were left in the telephone cables although many will have been lost in the fire i have been trying to contain the ones we know about thats why i had jones services board up the windows at the grimleys something tells me the old couplell not want to go back to their place not now
855682 weve got to do something to get his shadow back in time like you said but how do we do that
855683 this is what they call the dull look around there are no shadows being cast when there is no light no sun lamps or even moonlight then there are no shadows if the wisplurkers are caught out in the dull then like your shadows they simply disappear and become non beings
855684 and the second are the yelloweyes main enemies the redeye
855685 its a case of evolution and the survival of the fittest
855686 remember tobe we learnt about that in junior school ages ago
855687 exactly more advanced one step further on the evolution ladder whereas the yelloweyes are an intelligent species the redeyes are quick witted and cleverer they are not just extremely intelligent and inventive but also cunningly wicked they spend their time capturing the lesser yelloweye wisplurkers intending to wipe them all out there is no room in their world for anything that isnt perfect
855688 if these yelloweyes are dangerous to human because they eat our shadows then the redeye are on our side arent they inspector
855689 toby dodd youre horrible you would have to know all the gory details
855690 there are things you shouldnt know i id rather not say too much to you young uns its its too terrible i hope you never meet the really evil redeye from the dark echo
855691 weve got to get out theres no time to waste
855692 quiet theyll hear you do as i say and come to the window
855693 the hoomums are shutting us inside theyll be coming to cover this window next
855694 that geezer told us to make sure no one could get inside
855695 job done marvellous isnt it getting us up at the crack of dawn and on a sunday too just to nail a few boards to the doors and windows of this old house theres nothing inside worth nicking i had a look
855696 see its like i said hes not here theres just his clothes matthews nowhere
855697 you had to go to wood street and investigate if youd gone to school that morning this wouldnt have happened
855698 im going to find that inspector and ask him whats happened to my brother
855699 a footprint or a fingerprint with these private eye toby sherlock dodd had cracked the case
855700 in one of the pockets was an old bus ticket and it was for the number nine bus from the old telephone exchange to the stop at the corner of wood street
855701 the time on the ticket said half past four in the afternoon and it was dated the twentieth
855702 on the telly the milkman said the grimleys hadnt been seen since the seventeenth but if he went on a bus on the twentieth then perhaps they arent missing after all
855703 look at his after a couple of days of waiting i was able to see an orthopedist for approximately 37 3 seconds
855704 i dont want to be here id rather be golfing

855711 actually its just okay the applications crash a lot and its not nearly as fast as id hoped it would be sometimes it just hangs for like 10 seconds but at least its pretty

855726 on the one hand alzheimers disease is a complex pathologic process and that is daunting
855727 but now we are beginning to segregate out different therapeutic targets and develop drugs that have an impact on each target so in combination they may handle the disease better than any single approach
855728 we established the association but when it comes to explaining it we can only speculate at this state
855729 if you are looking for interventions to prevent alzheimers one way may be to identify people who have been divorced or widowed and who havent adapted or gotten back into the social circle and give them support with the aim of giving them new structure and social networks in their lives
855730 im really very happy to give the zero lost time accident safety award to companies that have celebrated one whole year of no lost time accident if the company is able to attain one whole year of no lost time accident then the government is ready to recognize the efforts of that company because it means that everyone here really works hard works hand in hand to be able to achieve your vision of having a safe and healthy work place

855744 you make decisions and try to put the team in the best possible situations thats what youve got to learn as a young player youve got to know what to do and when to do it
855745 its all a matter of watching tom and matt and matt do the things they do since they have been here a bit
855746 im trying to take advantage of every rep when im in there and every rep when im out of there by seeing how they do things
855747 we taught him in the spring and then we kind of re teach them in training camp and thats really helped him
855748 he seems a lot more comfortable and confident and hes quicker at the line of scrimmage it will be interesting to see him play
855749 i cant wait its been a long time for a lot of us rookies to have actually been in a game setting
855750 so much of it has been tryouts or combines and all that stuff to actually get down to playing in a game and be out here with the guys you spend all summer with its going to be competitive and a lot of fun im fairly certain im going to get time and for us young guys its the chance to get out there and play without holding anything back
855751 they are all so incredibly talented and its something you have to feel lucky as a quarterback to have
855752 every receiver on the roster brings something really special and they are all game changers at any given time
855753 i just love the fact we did not give up
855754 it wasnt the best way to get the runner over but it worked out
855755 ill just tell all of you to say whatever you want and write whatever you want
855756 thats all ive got for you today you guys write about it you saw it you write whatever you want report whatever
855757 this team doesnt quit this bullpen has been so good its like every time we do stink it up its like theyre obligated to go out and do something and they do
855758 a long term commitment of u s troops in an iraqi civil war is not in the interest of the u s iraq or the wider middle east
855759 we are there and we must finish what we started
855760 the military diplomatic and political progress would be squandered if we were to withdraw before iraq was ready to secure its own borders and protect its own cities
855761 congress needs to listen to our generals they have shown they have the expertise to assess well the military and political situation on the ground in iraq
855762 we should always remember that iraq is only one front of the global war on terror
855763 an iranian attack against israel would be a threat to peace in all regions of the world war is a last resort but if necessary i would support military action against iran they must know america is serious about protecting our allies and we cannot take anything off the table
855764 before i could support any military action i would need to be convinced not only that such action were in the national interest and in response to a clear threat but that there was a clear and achievable mission i have not yet seen such a mission described in iran
855765 if a diplomatic solution is not soon achieved the next congress and president may very well face a world crisis over an attack by israel to forestall nuclear weapons development in iran
855766 i will always act to protect the united states and american citizens we also have a responsibility to protect our allies especially our ally israel which has so often borne the brunt of irans violence and sponsorship of terrorism
855767 the united states must continue to work with our allies in diplomatic efforts with iran but also pursue tougher sanctions against the country and allow all options to remain on the table
855768 the war in iraq was a war of choice not a war of necessity our attention should have stayed in afghanistan
855769 the rise in violence and casualties in afghanistan have made it very apparent that additional troops are needed in the country
855770 the united states needs to encourage the nations in the region to have an open dialogue with each other the united states must act proactively by coordinating diplomatic political and economic solutions
855771 more troops from our nato allies would be very useful but it is even more important that to have a stable pakistan assisting our efforts in the region we cannot allow that government to fall to islamic radicals
855772 the resurgence of the taliban forces in afghanistan where they enjoy sanctuary status in the lawless portions of western pakistan must be broken in order for stability in that region to enjoy the same level of success as is being experienced in iraq
855773 the pace that berger and baiocco set today in the first laps i could not match and so i had to just go as fast as i could sixth was the best i could do in this situation and at least we scored some points
855774 i had a little problem in braking at the start and that made me run off the track early on but i got back on remained calm and went as fast as i could to the end
855775 it is great to win again and i really like this circuit it was a hard race but our championship position is much better now and that is the main thing to take from this weekend
855776 our intent is to raise 150 000 pounds of fresh produce on the farm annually and make it available first and foremost locally in the mad river valley and washington county and then also to other food shelves and pantries around the state
855777 its a way for us to sustain a sustainable source of fresh produce for the people we serve often times its the fresh produce that doesnt make its way into the shopping cart of needy vermonters because its unaffordable so they lose access and they lose the nutrient value of produce in their diet
855778 people took notice when the for sale sign went up
855779 they didnt want it developed if it was up a back road or the community wasnt as into it we might not have stepped in but the sense of opportunity became more about what it could be than about preventing development
855780 this farm is right on route 100 its got great access for people to see and drive past and its a gateway to the mad river valley
855781 my feeling has always been that were not taking business from local farmers because the pie is getting bigger as people realize the importance of eating locally
855782 its increasingly unaffordable for us to take fresh produce from outside the state so we need to gather as much locally as we can the short term gain is significant and the long term gain is well continue to have the fresh produce and the educational opportunities to better understand the issue of hunger

855802 a woman puts a lot of effort time overtime into her work in her early 20s mid late 20s then she gets to be about 30 years old and then she is thinking about marriage but its hard for her to find someone at that age the older you get the more entrenched you get in your lifestyle and it gets harder to adapt to another person

855837 the administrator believes that there is compelling and robust evidence that observed climate change can be attributed to the heating effect caused by global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
855838 based on the evidence before him the administrator believes it is reasonable to conclude current and future emissions of greenhouse gases will contribute to future climate change
855839 the administrator is aware that the range of potential impacts that can result from climate change spans many elements of the global environment and that all regions of the u s will be affected in some way
855840 the world is basically divided into two groups mds and everyone else
855841 what we dont know is if the tomatoes on that farm are implicated in the outbreak
855842 what fda has done is in our viewpoint the correct thing but they should have expanded it to include areas outside the united states that have no connection with the source of contamination
855843 there is an understanding between and among health professionals that the environment is playing a really important part in our health status
855844 there are major parts of the building that never shut down
855845 we have to have a certain airflow have to stay at a certain temperature so there are unique things that make cutting energy use more complicated
855846 is leaching into the environment and were ingesting some of that through fish and seafood
855847 if we dont protect our kids by removing hot dogs sausages deli slices and pepperoni slices from our schools were stacking the cards against them
855848 we are trying to move to a less processed environment
855849 but what we try to tell people is everything in moderation
855850 were asking consumers to make more complicated decisions but the numeracy and health literacy skills of many consumers are not at the level needed to handle this new responsibility
855851 the employers are interested because it means their employees are not on the phone taking care of doctors visits
855852 id say 80 percent of our people call health advocate because they have trouble with billing
855853 were not billing specialists were not registered nurses to have that resource is much more powerful it gets to the bottom of things quicker
855854 its a no brainer for those whove got net worth of 5 million or more
855855 youve got people who advise you on your taxes youve got people who advise you on how to manage your money but whats more important than your health
855856 for those consumers that can afford to have a boutique service
855857 no come o n o achava que aquilo era a perna de uma pessoa
855858 the taste is very similar to a regular hamburger because the oils and fats weve added even the seafood oils are neutral in taste and smell
855859 but if you tried to make a hamburger this lean at home it would be really hard and dry
855860 we thought of this as our way of protecting those at greatest risk as more information develops about jalape os
855861 we are going to put a hold on our raw jalape o inventory
855862 some people are born with the genetic factors necessary for awe inspiring ab development and some people have to work much harder for a lot less
855863 basically if theres a mosquito within a seven block radius they find their way to me
855864 im actually a good repellant for everyone else because mosquitoes are attracted to me like a lightning rod
855865 some individuals are more sensitive to bites so they notice them more
855866 some people produce more cues than others they give off more carbon dioxide anyone who is really active or has a naturally high metabolism its more than carbon dioxide though or mosquitoes would waste a lot of time chasing cars
855867 i find it incredible that some people will trust others with their most precious possessions their families and their homes but then not fairly treat the employees who perform these domestic services
855868 only right that the county reach out to let them know that they too have rights that deserve to be respected
855869 i was concerned about the reputation of our institution and whether we would be deemed to be the nanny government of all time
855870 i didnt want to miss the opportunity to be able to express my voice and my vote
855871 we identified a market need of phlebotomists in the greater metropolitan area
855872 as our population in the country as a whole gets grayer and older theres need for more and more testing as people get ill and need to get diagnosed
855873 his legacy is holding the fragile and sacred gift of human life in his hands and returning it unbroken
855874 it never occurred to me to call 911 or my physician
855875 as foolish as it may appear you are in a sense a prisoner of the pain which was intolerable youre thinking what could i do to relieve myself of it if it becomes intense enough youre perfectly willing to accept cardiac arrest as a possible way of getting rid of the pain
855876 the genes implicated in our study are ones that interact with the environment and are involved in how the brain converts what it sees from the environment
855877 if we can activate those genes by other mechanisms we might be able to help the kids
855878 if that is a general mechanism then the other genes that have been identified as associated with autism should be expected to be driven by activity as well but we dont know that yet
855879 environmental experiences and influences that shape postnatal brain development are not irrelevant
855880 we have but the most primitive ideas about what the proteins coded by identified missing or mutated genes do
855881 i felt like a piece of me had gone missing it was like i was split in two
855882 i was kind of stuck in a repetitive thinking about the suffering that she went through in the last month of her life and the last few weeks
855883 i just kept reliving that over and over again in my mind
855884 i think it has very important implications for how grief is conceptualized and how it is treated
855885 this shows that theres actually a difference in the brains of people who have the syndrome compared to the ones who dont
855886 some people are still confused by the fact that it does resemble regular grief
855887 i wanted to know if there is something different in the brain when people are processing their grief in those who are adapting well and those who are not adapting well
855888 the question was are their brains processing their grief differently
855889 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
855890 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
855891 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
855892 our mission is to provide free and culturally appropriate health care to the latino community
855893 i understand that we need to create structures and systems as we grow but it is sensitivity to clients that makes this place so special
855894 we were created to help a population that fled from the trauma of civil wars and crossing borders the idea was not to cause more trauma or put up more barriers we have to modernize but without losing the essence of what we are this is my great fear
855895 we know the salmonella was on two produce items it could easily have been on three
855896 it is certainly plausible that tomatoes were responsible for the early phases of the outbreak
855897 it is the first time i can think of where we have foreign aid treating a chronic disease
855898 its a challenge to take this on i think the questions it raises are going to be important ones for the future
855899 weve never really been confronted with this in the international health arena
855900 would undoubtedly elicit major concern and extensive assistance from the u s government
855901 the u s response to the epidemic in black america stands in sharp contrast to our response to the epidemic overseas
855902 cdc prevention efforts have really tried to follow the epidemic
855903 i think there are important parallels between the epidemic in africa and the epidemic among black people in the united states
855904 in a lot of places it is a generalized epidemic
855905 weve achieved more in the fight against aids in the last two years than in the preceding 20 years
855906 the gap between those who are in need of treatment and those who have access to treatment is widening
855907 there are kids 7 year olds on the team and it is really fun i never thought id hold a world record to be able to tell them youre probably faster than i was at that age
855908 than to lose the weight like you did and to look in the mirror and say four words
855909 that the biggest side effect is im hardly stressed over anything
855910 im not 268 pounds anymore and im still not a jock but i am fit
855911 im still waiting to get picked for the congressional basketball team
855912 god has not designed this thing for you to die prematurely some of you would rather not go to doctors they would rather be in the darkness about their health but the scripture doesnt say that
855913 like so much else about the disease here that is a mystery
855914 mediterranean and low carbohydrate diets may be safe and effective alternatives to low fat diets
855915 from a weight loss perspective it all comes down to calories
855916 but there were only 45 women in the study so dont put too much weight on it because of the small numbers
855917 the first take home message is that if you are embarking on weight loss start with a low carbohydrate or mediterranean diet
855918 but it is hard and it is not going to happen rapidly
855919 its the woman who is going for the younger guy
855920 the process of developing a successful relationship is the same whether someone is in the 20s or 80s people do better if they are matched with those who are similar to them on important dimensions
855921 age in and of itself is not a factor in compatibility
855922 there is less need to negotiate differences a lot less emotional wear and tear
855923 everyone would like to find someone smarter better looking wealthier and sure younger why wouldnt you start there
855924 youre willing to make a number of different trade offs in the end it doesnt matter what a persons age is it matters how well they connect
855925 at my age i dont believe in long engagements no use fooling around
855926 we were raised in the same manner we were raised in the same era we have so much to talk about
855927 why is telling right from left more difficult than telling above from below
855928 adults take longer to judge the locations of horizontal stimuli than to judge the locations of vertical stimuli
855929 you are young and keep wondering why and how is this terrible disease affecting you keep talking to others
855930 in the new world the brand isnt necessarily health in the abstract its whatever your need is
855931 will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
855932 her existing constitutional rights with regards to that relationship will be terminated
855933 unprecedented interference in the doctor patient relationship and unprecedented interference in a womans life
855934 we do think its a good law because it does provide a woman with the broadest spectrum of information
855935 this has been tried before but its never reached this point
855936 the hospital authority is working diligently the state and county are doing their part as evidenced by todays agreement
855937 today the supply as well as the demand have led to these dramatic fluctuations in prices
855938 our goal among other things is to make sure that this little plant is available in sufficient supply and that over time we can rationalize the prices
855939 officials need to stop downplaying or ignoring whats happening among latinos
855940 hispanics are overrepresented in this epidemic and we need to target our efforts to them
855941 you combine the economic pressures loneliness and immigration worries and it pushes these individuals to be a hidden population
855942 weve made tremendous strides but our work is not nearly finished two million people died last year of hiv aids over two and a half million people died of malaria and tb
855943 this is by far the only true foreign policy program thats working the dollars are actually making a difference
855944 hiv is a death sentence no question about it if you go untreated youre going to die
855945 its one thing to say youll support it at 15 billion its another thing to say youll support it at 35 billion to me its entirely another thing to support it at 50 billion
855946 the acquisition has opened up new vistas for new treatments
855947 it really will help very rapidly accelerate the cancer treatments weve worked on
855948 we both looked at each other and said this seems like a great opportunity to put two complementary groups together to make one great company
855949 i support the primary objective of this legislation to forestall reductions in physician payments
855950 yet taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians is wrong
855951 i guess the president is voting with them and not with americas seniors and those with disabilities when he vetoed this bill
855952 it is not confronting any of the major spending or organizational issues concerning medicare
855953 rioters drove two vehicles into a station under the border patrol armed police division in the xinjiang city of kashgar
855954 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine
855955 the only sign i saw of her was of somebody being pretty positive about life
855956 its hard dealing with something thats happened 15 months ago
855957 i find it hard to believe shes just gone off on a jaunt
855958 if she is out there the further effort will locate her
855959 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
855960 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
855961 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
855962 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
855963 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
855964 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
855965 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
855966 i would look around and think i cant possibly get this all done and then burst into tears
855967 im always in a state of anxiety but it only piles up every few months
855968 all my friends do this were all over scheduled we live in bethesda its a way of life
855969 our teenagers are becoming more over scheduled and over stressed
855970 our definition of what makes a kid successful has become unbearably narrow
855971 theyve got to go discover the cure for cancer by working at nih for the summer and you cant just play a sport you have to play several and be in leagues during the summer and get coaching its all done for r sum building
855972 some kids need more enrichment activities and other kids are over enriched
855973 parents should look at their child and see whether what theyre doing is giving them joy
855974 all kids need some downtime and the flexibility to change their focus when they want
855975 this is about reframing your message of what the purpose of school is which is that its not the best thing to be busy every minute of your life
855976 i was a basket case who couldnt put two and two together
855977 bread and butter dermatology i dont have a good explanation
855978 if youre not thinking of it you could miss it
855979 i just acted like a patient and thats what got me in trouble
855980 i never at any point until the end of this illness suspected they didnt know what they were doing dr luber saved my life
855981 was in the room less than a minute when he said you will be feeling better in a few days
855982 the dermatologist gently scraped clarks inflamed leathery skin and then had him look at the slide under the microscope
855983 very surprised i remember him saying that no one had mentioned scabies
855984 several told me i was an infectious disease specialist and i should have figured it out
855985 that was very unfair and made me angry i was a basket case who couldnt put two and two together
855986 weve added classes and workshops outside of our normal scope to accommodate people who have come and asked about bikes
855987 youd be surprised how many people are really resistant to wearing a helmet
855988 if you cant convince them theyre adults and what can you do
855989 i went to rock and roll heaven and i wasnt on the guest list

856018 todays report from unaids on the global aids epidemic demonstrates that efforts to slow the rate of new infections and to sustain those living with the virus are making a real difference in some of the areas hardest hit by the pandemic
856019 this riveting collection makes a compelling case that the united states has an injustice system at work and that it operates its own gulag within this supposedly free society largely out of sight of its citizenry the brutalities cruelties and inhumanity widely prevalent in the way people are put in prison kept there degraded and mistreated as recounted in this books accounts of racist bias medical care prison labor parole rape and the restraint chair among many other topics read like something out of kafka and solzenhitzyn this important book is a shocker

856033 shell soon reveal what many wouldnt because they didnt want to be involved with it
856034 she had to quit her job and is now unable to work and we have spent our savings on attorneys
856035 we have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed
856036 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
856037 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
856038 there were rumours of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
856039 we need more medicines and blood but we are trying to do our best with what we have
856040 there were too many rumours we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand
856041 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
856042 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
856043 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness says the monk who resides in a monastery of the order of friars minor capuchin in stalowa wola southern poland

856183 no se trata desde luego y contra lo que parece o quiere suponer que parezca la asociaci n actora los amics de que la di cesis de l rida se hubiese mostrado inactiva o remisa sino lisa y llanamente de que el m ximo tribunal de la iglesia cat lica rechaz todas las razones incidentales unas y de fondo otras en pro de la permanencia que aquella di cesis no la asociaci n naturalmente pretend a alcanzar

856188 atendiendo a las normas y acuerdos concordatarios que rigen en la actualidad las relaciones entre el estado vaticano y el espa ol no se aprecia la existencia de circunstancias ni causa v lida alguna que concluido aquel largo procedimiento can nico permita bisar revisar o reproducir las mismas actuaciones esta vez ante tribunales civiles del estado espa ol sin que se vulnere lo acordado entre aquellos poderes

856282 a russian jewish historian shaul ginzburg wrote an article about this subject in 1931 in the ny yiddish newspaper zkukumft in the article he quotes letters from chabadnick zvi heikin 1876 as a first documented version of the lubavitcher agaddta about mysterious wondered who was seen in ukraine in ostropol and fastov who revealed his identity before he died as r moshe ben schneur zalman of liadi

856298 my bookmark reveals ive been reading it since january 2004
856299 yeah well i guess im one so let me see

856304 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine
856305 the only sign i saw of her was of somebody being pretty positive about life
856306 its hard dealing with something thats happened 15 months ago
856307 i find it hard to believe shes just gone off on a jaunt
856308 if she is out there the further effort will locate her
856309 its good to see that there is an initiative to create jobs in the private sector i think that thats brilliant and i think that andrew forest from the fortescue metals group should be congratulated on that
856310 however its an overly ambitious program its based upon falsehood so its like the prime minister wants to push a restart button and pretend that the government has not since 1967 so for 41 years now worked on policies and programs to implement job opportunities for aboriginal torres strait islander people around australia
856311 theres been probably a billion or more dollars spent over those 40 years in training programs and job outcomes so its very ambitious and i think its irresponsible of the prime minister to announce a scheme like this without presenting much more specifics
856312 behind that the reasons for the failures in the programs in the past and this program i would forecast will fail dramatically simply because the government just wants to make the same mistakes all over again
856313 as i understand it at its highest point the cdep community development employment projects employed about 35 000 people around australia and i think at the same time there was less than 30 000 people employed in the public service and i think less than 20 000 people employed in the private sector
856314 to talk about creating all of a sudden 50 000 additional jobs for aboriginal people is far beyond the figures that are available
856315 now im not sure of the accuracy of the figures that are around at the moment but thats simply because the government over a decade ago discontinued to provide any information about the levels of aboriginal employment and training
856316 what we found is that the jobs are still not there and they never have been there and theyve never been made available through training programs that the governments offered
856317 its got to be also a positive initiative taken on by the aboriginal community that if it does involve people having to make adjustments to their lives to their communities and their families in order to take up jobs then the communities have to be willing to do it
856318 we saw 30 years ago nsw trying to move people from western areas of the state into newcastle to get jobs in the mining industries there that failed dramatically
856319 weve seen queensland also trying to move people around to get jobs that failed dramatically also
856320 so it has to be a co operative approach between aboriginal people and government to get an outcome and the private sector has to commit itself in fact i think that it will never succeed in australia unless there is affirmative action legislation put in place
856321 but i think its the private sector the public sector has shown that it can actually employ aboriginal torres strait islander people theres been a recent decline but up until the howard administration the levels of aboriginal people employed in the public sector were greater than the percentages in the community
856322 i think it was more than 1 5 per cent 2 per cent of people were employed in the public sector and the targets had been met
856323 in the private sector in fact the figures went backwards not forwards on the whole thing and of course there were also many jobs in the community sector when community controlled organisations were delivering services those jobs have disappeared as well
856324 these sort of sensational headlines in one day are not going to help the situation as i said ive been involved personally i mean theres 20 years worth of studies done into employment in 1988
856325 the government launched the aboriginal primate development policy i was a part of that and that had been after many years of policy and research to get those things in place and then they were all abandoned in 1996
856326 now were trying to go straight from cdep to 50 000 jobs its just unrealistic
856327 when were looking at the water crisis what most people acknowledge is that theres going to have to be some pain and whether that means water restrictions or whether that means paying more people accept that thats the reality
856328 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
856329 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
856330 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
856331 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
856332 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
856333 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
856334 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it
856335 theres no disagreement with the attorney general and myself on this
856336 weve done a redacted submission to the inquiry but the redacted submission to the inquiry doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
856337 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into the community and in the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision

856350 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
856351 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
856352 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

856382 la preocupante situaci n por la que atraviesa la fauna de la zona constantemente atacada por cazadores que atentan contra especies no cineg ticas aquellas cuya caza est prohibida dentro del ejido municipal de este departamento
856383 evidente violaci n a numerosas leyes de orden nacional y provincial por lo que el ejecutivo municipal tiene las facultades necesarias para hacerlas respetar
856384 las distintas especies de aves que se hallan en nuestra zona constituyen un atractivo tur stico para los visitantes que pueden disfrutar del avistaje de especies en libertad que generalmente no se conocen en grandes urbes como cardenales reinas moras cabecitas negras caranchos lechuzas b hos y otras
856385 la matanza es frecuente en zonas de mucha afluencia tur stica como la colina de la virgen el puerto el quinto cuartel y otros lugares donde es com n ver a j venes con gomeras o rifles de aire comprimido atentando contra las aves que est n en su camino

856387 me encantar a una medalla de oro no lo digo porque se trate solamente de un sue o argentina tiene con qu para conseguirla estoy tranquila porque durante este tiempo fuimos por el camino correcto para llegar de la mejor manera nos entrenamos como si supi ramos que vamos a ganar el oro eso es importante para un equipo que aspira a llegar a lo m s alto
856388 sue o con la medalla de oro colgada en el cuello y escuchando el himno argentino pero tambi n entiendo que los juegos ol mpicos son dif ciles de predecir ya no sucede lo de a os atr s cuando holanda y argentina sacaban diferencia del resto
856389 se dice que tuvimos suerte en el sorteo pero hoy todo est muy parejo y puede pasar cualquier cosa
856390 a ese torneo lo asumimos como de preparaci n para el objetivo final que son los juegos ol mpicos no imaginaba llegar a una final y menos ganarla de esa manera con un 6 a 2 sobre alemania el champions trophy fue un impulso an mico buen simo para todas ayud a la confianza de cada una y nos hizo entender que los cambios que venimos haciendo en nuestro juego sobre todo en el sistema defensivo marcando en zona fueron productivos
856391 nos cost un poco el recambio pero por suerte tampoco lo sufrimos tanto en otros seleccionados el proceso dura muchos a os

856396 we have to traverse one and a half km to perform our puja moreover the archeological department is carrying out its renovation work at snails pace the local hindu devotees are unable to pray here as the department has not yet handed over the charge of this temple
856397 if the archeological department takes immediate steps to renovate this temple it will be a boon
856398 scientists are usually a fairly reserved bunch but even they are starting to sound frantic about whats happening with the climate
856399 thats not surprising given that if we carry on treating the planet like a cheap boil in the bag dinner we risk causing catastrophic climate change thats probably a bad idea
856400 i thought we were the only team out of the four who played last weekend that did enough over the course of a game to win it
856401 we played well for about 50 minutes today and wakefield struggled like we did both physically and mentally eastmond kicked well and scored a good try but he did get stood up by a second row in the second half
856402 the season is still alive but the most concerning things are the defence and team cohesion and they are down to me
856403 there could be some major surgery before next week i would rather play with a team of youngsters than a team who gets brushed off in one on one tackles

856405 i think its a smart strategy for the university to reach employees in multiple ways because we dont all have the same habits i dont use text messages every day but i know colleagues and students who do
856406 our approach at duke is to send out emergency notification through different mediums to reach as many people as quickly as possible
856407 text messaging will supplement our other dukealert communications which include e mail the outdoor warning system phone messages fliers and web sites

856414 weve been kind of sports rivals back and forth for a long time
856415 i guess i always wanted to be in the restaurant business
856416 i like to entertain people i want to make sure everyone is happy
856417 its a different vibe and a different feel in here i think its warm and inviting everyone feels welcome
856418 i guess on moody street theres no real american bar and grill were not exactly bar food but were not exactly fine dining
856419 ill be working with people and creating forums on how we can work together to make this a better district
856420 its clearly something people in waltham are looking for and in that respect it was a great match for me
856421 my wife and i are happy to be moving back to waltham its in the greater boston area and my wife and i were looking to relocate
856422 just being a part of the greater boston area its going to increase the diversity and clearly thats attractive to us
856423 they are really wanting to look at the system and take it to where they can make it even better as to how to best prepare our children for a global economy
856424 issues such as better use of technology and skills and ways for people to work well together are issues all schools are trying to address not just schools in waltham
856425 im planning various meetings with various individuals and i will be planning those more next week
856426 ive been focusing on learning about the district and trying to have discussions about some of the points that were aired during the focus groups
856427 in the focus report a mention was made about the work thats being done by district administrators and directors
856428 there was reference to the fact that an effort needed to be made so people had the same focus
856429 its important for people to realize the basis of my entrance plan is to communicate with people to learn about the district
856430 the school committee theyve had a superintendent thats been in that position for nine or 10 years and i think discussions about roles are equally important
856431 i think one thing people were looking for was someone with experience as a superintendent that certainly stood out with peter
856432 hes certainly a people person i think hes someone that interacts well with other people and thats one thing that definitely stood out
856433 the major meetings that we have to plan for is the upcoming meeting with district administrators theres approximately 43 building and district administrators
856434 the second most important meeting is the first meeting with the teachers the convocation and thats going to be the tuesday after labor day
856435 those long term goals will evolve as i learn about the district
856436 my goal is to work together with people and improve whats already a good district
856437 that person is really going to be a window to the rest of the world
856438 in the future i would look within the district and make sure we are building the skills in our current teaching staff and administrators to move them to the next level
856439 i can give you a point of view that ive shared openly in meetings and the interview process
856440 for three years i was evaluated using a tool that used a 270 point scale basically there were 30 critical areas they evaluated i received exemplary status from the winchendon school committee in each of the years they evaluated me but the last year they voted on a higher proficiency and i was five points off from exemplary and thats almost the same score i got the year before
856441 at this point its all about the future for me realizing that people have that question and knowing that question will disappear based on my performance
856442 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
856443 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea
856444 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
856445 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
856446 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us
856447 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
856448 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
856449 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well
856450 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
856451 el uso de las tic en este tema es de suma impotancia
856452 thats the one weve been working on a long time
856453 this jewel in the city restored to its natural glory
856454 this isnt the first bite of the apple this is the entire apple
856455 newton watertown and waltham did extremely well as far as preservation of money from the original budget
856456 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
856457 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
856458 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
856459 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
856460 waltham address its location on the river and its wonderful historic character
856461 i have a condition that requires me to go to the bathroom every 10 minutes

856482 they are subject to violence both physical and verbal to a degree that is unprecedented
856483 we note that the government has failed to complete or conclude any of the investigations on attacks threats and acts of terrorism against the media and journalists during the past two years
856484 the same website has also demanded that media adopt self censorship in the name of national security and the fight against terrorism openly calling for the violent if necessary curtailment of media freedom as a necessary sacrifice in defense of larger freedoms

856501 many bishops came to this gathering in fear and trembling expecting either a distasteful encounter between those of vastly different opinions or the cold shoulder from those who disagree the overwhelming reality has been just the opposite we have prayed cried learned and laughed together and discovered something deeper about the body of christ we know more of the deeply faithful ministry of those in vastly differing contexts and we have heard repeatedly of the life and death matters confronting vast swaths of the communion hunger disease lack of education and employment climate change war and violence we have remembered that together we may be the largest network on the planet able to respond to those life and death issues if we tend to the links connections and bonds between us we have not resolved the differences among us but have seen the deep need to maintain relationships even in the face of significant disagreement and discomfort the anglican communion is suffering the birth pangs of something new which none of us can yet fully appreciate or understand yet we know that the spirit continues to work in our midst at the same time patience is being urged from many quarters that all may more fully know the leading of the spirit god is faithful may we be faithful as well

856561 they have given unbelievable courage and bravery in the iraq freedom effort but i think it is now time for the iraqis to step up to the plate and find the courage they need
856562 its time for us to allow the iraqis to stand up on their own
856563 we are moving in a direction and we have been consistently where the objective of our military has been to provide an opportunity for the iraqis to have the breathing room they needed and to stand up on their own two feet
856564 not only are the casualties the lowest in history at only 11 last month but the withdrawal is being completed
856565 the casualties are at their lowest level and the troops are withdrawing so we are making great progress in iraq and in terms of the goals we established and that president bush outlined
856566 the goals going in were to search for and find any weapons of mass destruction depose sadaam hussein to allow the iraqis to have free elections and write a constitution and help them to build a military that could defend them
856567 we have accomplished all those except the latter and thats about done
856568 most americans now expect gasoline prices to hit 5 by labor day and favor bold energy and climate related fixes according to a new national opinion survey conducted by opinion research corporation orc for the nonprofit and nonpartisan civil society institute csi think tank and its citizens lead for energy action now clean project www cleanenergyaction net in another finding energy prices have jumped substantially since january 2008 as the top worry of americans ahead of fears of joblessness recession economic downturn and the mortgage foreclosure crisis for the first time the csi survey finds that a majority of americans are now more likely to buy a hybrid or other fuel efficient vehicle than they were six months ago the new csi clean survey looks ahead to expectations about labor day 2008 gauges the level of anger among americans about todays gasoline prices and assesses how gas prices energy policy will impact the thinking of voters this year in an earlier january 2008 orc survey conducted for csi clean 71 percent of americans correctly forecast that gasoline prices would hit 4 by this summer

856577 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
856578 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
856579 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
856580 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
856581 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
856582 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
856583 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
856584 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
856585 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
856586 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
856587 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
856588 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
856589 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
856590 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
856591 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
856592 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
856593 you are afraid to jay walk you will walk a mile to the traffic light to cross the road are you stupid with this attitude people will walk all over you you havent changed at all you dont understand how the world works you have to be smart but instead you will follow the rules mark my words life will fuck you up with an attitude like that
856594 we believe you should be married by 25 and should have kids by 30 thats proper living
856595 what have you achieved in life make a career for yourself be self sufficient and financially independent then we can discuss your marital options
856596 umm well my daughter is kind of different yes shes very pretty but shes equally complicated she dumps people a lot she is too selective and will probably be a bad match for anybody thank you though ill keep you in mind when she recovers from her permanent crazed intellectualism
856597 comprob que el 27 de las instituciones que se dedican en todo el mundo a atender a los enfermos de sida son cat licas con el dinero de la caridad el 44 pertenece a los gobiernos instituciones financiadas con los impuestos el 11 a organizaciones no gubernamentales y un 8 a otras confesiones religiosas
856598 despu s recib otra propuesta del leadership fund de parte de los ee
856599 junto al cardenal angelo sodano entonces secretario de estado me pregunt si somos unos mil doscientos millones de cat licos en el mundo por qu vamos mendigando ayudas donde no nos las quieren dar
856600 la fundaci n el buen samaritano canaliza toda la ayuda de la iglesia por los enfermos del sida
856601 en absoluto la fundaci n el buen samaritano promueve orienta y coordina hasta cierto punto las ayudas que se dan en toda la iglesia y que brindan diversas organizaciones pensemos en el caso de mozambique donde est trabajando la comunidad de san egidio all no entramos actuamos donde nadie lo hace por eso animamos a las organizaciones de ayuda a los enfermos de sida les pedimos que se activen incluso hasta hacer inoperante el buen samaritano y si las organizaciones cubrieran todo ser a magn fico nuestra funci n es subsidiaria donde las instituciones no llegan entonces s entra la santa sede con la fundaci n el buen samaritano
856602 el problema de los hu rfanos es horrible los j venes padres de estas nuevas generaciones han muerto ahora los ni os pasan a la casa de los abuelos y estos no tienen capacidad f sica ni emocional para mantenerlos en todas sus necesidades

856604 dan moet je bijvoorbeeld allerlei gegevens uit dossiers van lopende en afgesloten onderzoeken achterhalen dat kost vreselijk veel tijd over de urgentie van het probleem zijn we het eens maar met een parlementaire enqu te vang je geen grote criminelen
856605 dan ook blij met het voorschrijdende inzicht van het cda
856606 het is goed dat hij dat doet vanuit zijn verantwoordelijkheid
856607 holleeder heeft zich in de periode augustus 1998 tot eind 2005 samen met anderen schuldig gemaakt aan diverse misdrijven waaronder in het bijzonder afpersing van een drietal personen van wie bekend was dat zij vermogend waren
856608 afpersingen behoren tot een categorie strafbare feiten waardoor een ernstige inbreuk gemaakt wordt op de rechtsorde en die in de samenleving gevoelens van onrust en onveiligheid veroorzaken verdachte kon dat weten aangezien hij eerder tot een gevangenisstraf van lange duur is veroordeeld terzake van onder meer afpersingen en hij bij die gelegenheid eveneens is geconfronteerd met de ingrijpendheid van een dergelijke gebeurtenis voor het slachtoffer
856609 uit de getuigenverklaringen komt een beeld naar voren van een man die als hem iets niet zint er niet voor terugdeinst om geweld te gebruiken daar waar verdachte heeft bekend geweld te hebben gebruikt bagatelliseert hij dat danwel zijn eigen aandeel daarin met de mishandeling heeft de verdachte niet alleen de slachtoffers pijn en letsel toegebracht maar ook de openbare veiligheid geschaad hetgeen tot gevoelens van onrust leidt
856610 hij is geschrokken maar inmiddels weer bij de pinken hij blijft heel erg strijdbaar
856611 le jour o tu chevaucheras seul le cheval de tes opinions sur les terres arides de la pens e tu auras gagn mon respect
856612 uhg i hate feeling like this i hate being with myself when i feel this i wish i could turn it off
856613 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
856614 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
856615 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
856616 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
856617 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
856618 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
856619 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
856620 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
856621 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
856622 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
856623 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
856624 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
856625 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
856626 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
856627 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
856628 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
856629 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
856630 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
856631 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
856632 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
856633 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
856634 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
856635 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
856636 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
856637 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
856638 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
856639 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
856640 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
856641 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
856642 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
856643 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
856644 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
856645 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
856646 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
856647 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
856648 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
856649 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
856650 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
856651 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
856652 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
856653 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
856654 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
856655 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
856656 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
856657 who are open to doing something on the production side
856658 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
856659 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
856660 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
856661 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
856662 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
856663 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
856664 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
856665 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
856666 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
856667 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
856668 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
856669 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
856670 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
856671 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
856672 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
856673 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
856674 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
856675 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
856676 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
856677 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
856678 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
856679 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
856680 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
856681 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
856682 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
856683 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
856684 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
856685 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
856686 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
856687 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
856688 flattered by the attention to my work brought by this russian state prize

856694 sons of two sisters and my brother died in the tragedy how could our goddess do this
856695 learning through films is actually very helpful because they reflect the society and you tend to understand the societal dynamics through movies
856696 if i can watch a movie and there is some theoretical concepts which have been depicted over there then thats a better way to retain and since management is experiential learning the film brings that element into it
856697 these 3 films are able to meet my objective so for characteristics of the mobiliser swades is helping me if i am teaching mobilisation process manthan is of great help and if i am teaching the village institution building chak de india helps me
856698 having the same old course books and case studies and all well everybody does that but having films bring that extra edge to the whole thing and its fun
856699 the most efficient route for errands deliveries and sales calls

856705 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
856706 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
856707 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
856708 hes probably been under pressure more so this year than ever before with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
856709 the defence has been under more pressure than ever so i think those two things combined have probably put darren under a lot of pressure and its probably showing his injury to be worse than it probably is get the best of foxtel
856710 di balik lemari dengan tubuh lemes dan perut yang lapar dengan semangat 10 aku berkhayal dengan pemikiran disana bersama logika ku hari ini 19 oktober 2005

856712 hanya ada dua cara menjalani kehidupan kita pertama adalah seolah tidak ada keajaiban kedua adalah seolah segala sesuatu adalah keajaiban
856713 usaha pencarian kebenaran dan keindahan merupakan kegiatan yang memberi peluang bagi kita untuk menjadi kanak kanak sepanjang hayat
856714 kecerdasan tidak banyak berperan dalam proses penemuan ada suatu lompatan dalam kesadaran sebutlah itu intuisi atau apapun namanya solusinya muncul begitu saja dan kita tidak tahu bagaimana atau mengapa

856738 i remember when greg norman played the masters and he started to make bogey and he never stopped
856739 i said to my caddie i have to make a putt just one putt
856740 if i just made a bogey im ok but i ended up trying to force the issue a bit too much

856747 likewise when youre unhappy with a plan ive announced i need you to ask me if im open to further discussion if i have time and am willing to open the topic with you then we can talk privately if i dont have time and i feel that i have sufficient input to move ahead ill let you know but once my decision is final its critical that you support it and me
856748 i think youre a great asset i value your work and your thinking on a large number of important issues this feedback that im giving you is going to be important for you to integrate into your thinking as you continue in your career if anything im saying is unclear or you want to talk about it at a later point let me know you have a lot to offer our clients and the company and this communication issue is getting in the way of your doing that
856749 you need a good hr department it construction someone to manage the portfolio you need someone with a business background running these operations

856751 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
856752 it is the most challenging times i have ever seen
856753 we dont have enough of some of our cars to sell
856754 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
856755 thats why were accelerating production of four cylinder models and quickly responding to market conditions
856756 it seemed like we needed a 12 step program to cure us of our addictions to buying beaten up stocks trading at large discounts to our assessment of their intrinsic value

856763 reliance is in this whole networked economy the olpc initiative will help us bring in more users
856764 these are very complex molecular signals and the authors have very nicely shown that there is one molecule laminins 511 that is a very important signal to tell the hair molecule to move through the process its part of a basic biological understanding
856765 mice are not just little men and women they are different than us and also different in their hair
856766 so laminin 511 is an early epithelial message to the dermis to say lets start producing hair
856767 hair is formed as a result of cooperation and communication between the two layers
856768 we knew that the two layers of the skin are important in hair formation and we knew that there was some early epithelial signal hypothesized a long time ago but no one knew what it was until now
856769 the hair follicles are still there but they get stuck in the cycle so its not well understood why theyre stuck and how do you get them unstuck
856770 the hope of course is that you can apply this to humans but there are some cautions in all that biology is very complex there are a lot of checks and balances you dont want hair follicles and cells in hair follicles to be growing too much or not enough the on and off signals that are dampening that and controlling that are very very complex and not well understood this is far far from humans
856771 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
856772 we express our deep sympathies to the family of benjamin and pray that god will give them comfort in this time of sorrow

856788 the required removal of shoes at the security checkpoint is one of the biggest complaints we get from passengers so we are trying something new that will allow us to maintain a high level of security while accommodating travelers
856789 the scanners are here but were just waiting for the airport to change the electrical connections to accommodate the machines
856790 the success of this technology relies on whether the tsa will get too many false alarms or if the technology does not detect suspicious items the way it should
856791 but the tsa is to be applauded for their efforts to speed up the checkpoint process because one of the greatest hassles of flying is having to take off your shoes during the screening process
856792 the ambiguity in defining vote rigging has led to difficulties in our supervision

856795 things got to the point where they had to do something and they did theyre happy mannys happy im going to miss my man im not going to lie to you but were looking forward the team needed it
856796 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
856797 from the front office standpoint i feel like this did have to happen sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decisions was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the same goal

856799 the rr500 turbine introduced this week by rolls royce represents the next step in our exploration of alternative fuel power for personal aircraft
856800 the rugged mooney airframe is uniquely suited to accept the power of the rolls royce engine and were very excited about working with rolls royce to examine the possibility of bringing a jet a fuel powered mooney turboprop to the market in the future
856801 such an aircraft configuration fills two growing voids in the market
856802 first a four place turboprop represents a logical step for the tens of thousands of pilots now flying high performance piston aircraft because the transition to flying a small turboprop will require no special type rating or unusual insurance requirements second a jet a powered turbine provides the basis of a product that has global appeal

856817 but what we were seeing for example on the carrollton corridor was we were seeing about 700 speeders per day which is a high number of speeders
856818 i just hope it doesnt have people in a panic
856819 does an emergency vehicle come behind you were you part of a funeral procession or something like that that the images arent going to show
856820 but were going to be able to see that through video and thats the reason we do it
856821 what were seeing already is were seeing huge reductions in speeders for example on the carrollton corridor we were looking at 700 speeders a day now were looking at 100 speeders a day

856862 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world
856863 i think republican candidate john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win

856876 i work in a different department than my husband he is a manager and gets attention from many people he works under some tense and stressful situations as well weve been married about 5 months
856877 i am writing about a young lady that joined the company 2 weeks before our wedding
856878 i was present when this young woman was introduced to my husband i could see a sudden change in his face there was a kind of inner happiness beaming on his face i knew he liked her from that moment
856879 anyways she is neither a flirt or what i would call a bad girl i must say that she too was drawn to my husband from the beginning i did not take these reactions too seriously at the time
856880 he would become so happy if he got a chance to talk with her and i have caught him staring at her eyes
856881 both you and your new spouse have a great deal to learn about how love works
856882 i mention that first because a marriage between two persons is all about taking a journey to learn
856883 that means third your need to have an honest conversation with your significant other is pending when you have it is all up to how much you allow your fears to prevent you from having it
856884 the key to having a long marriage is all in how you handle the conflicts so you must approach your concerns from a vantage point of wanting to honestly learn something new about your spouse
856885 there are some radio talk show advisors who would say
856886 the only thing in your relationship you own are your feelings
856887 for instance hun i have been feeling really uncomfortable lately and i want to speak with you about why i feel the way i do can we talk now or would you prefer to speak at another time we can agree on would be a great way to begin your search for answers
856888 you did this or you do that when you are around her
856889 this question will reveal a couple of things to you his confusion of feelings and how interested you are in learning something about him this can be intimidating especially to a person who may never have thought his feelings were that important and revealing
856890 ultimately you are have been taught how to express your feelings far better than he
856891 so as i might have told you many men seek out their mother when they seek out a person to love in a long term relationship try to avoid mothering him but do attempt at all cost to allow him to know you have feelings and a deep interest in a commitment to a marriage you would like to be viewed as important and valuable
856892 it is possible to honour the world health organisation guidelines in my opinion only because of unitaid and the government of france

856901 no you can not do more hey you only have very little time to teach students and you have over 1000 you can not teach them everything we need foreign teachers so students feel excited about english and so that they can get used to being around foreigners you did this even when you were tired you still acted excited
856902 but couldnt you hire any foreigner for that who cares if theyre qualified teachers
856903 yes but that is a difficult job hey there are not many teachers who can keep attention of students for forty minutes
856904 the students liked you and i could see that they became very comfortable with you two years ago when we have no foreign teacher the students were very scared to speak english now they speak lots
856905 yah but only really easy sentences and most of the time they dont even do it correctly

856932 we have decided to continue to move forward with at least a number of our productions
856933 larry im not going to go there and heres why because pakistan is a sovereign nation but i want to assure you i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
856934 we have various options the nuremberg trials are certainly an example of the kind of tribunal that we could move forward with
856935 senator obamas failure to comprehend the implication of the supreme court decision he embraced and the historical precedent of nuremberg raise serious questions about judgment and experience and whether senator obama is ready to assume the awesome responsibilities of commander in chief
856936 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising them the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy

856945 warning of a looming economic calamity gov paterson yesterday called an emergency session of the state legislature and raised the specter that new york may have to sell off roads bridges and tunnels to close a massive and still growing budget deficit
856946 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2nd quarter
856947 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
856948 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
856949 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
856950 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
856951 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
856952 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
856953 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
856954 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
856955 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
856956 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

856958 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
856959 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
856960 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
856961 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
856962 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
856963 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
856964 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
856965 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
856966 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
856967 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
856968 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
856969 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
856970 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges

856988 bubba there is no spot on earth where people detest credit and debt more than the hallowed ground you now stand or rather sit upon
856989 why tis but a mere pittance when you consider everything you get from it
856990 its almost nothing really the attendee should be ashamed of himself for taking such advantage of me
856991 its only 4 999 if you act this week its usually 6 000 were running a special but i dont know how much longer were going to be able to offer this at such an amazing price
856992 uh sorry bubba were not really set up for checks
856993 alright ill have to go to a bank and draw out the cash
856994 uh no sorry bubba but were not really set up for cash either we do however accept visa master card discover card american express and the diners club
856995 its worth 5 000 bucks just for the cap and whistle
856996 i am going to invent a new kind of debt destruction engine one completely different from the ones you told us about behold the going for broke version of the debt destruction engine
856997 bubba let me make sure i understand what youre saying you say you have been contributing to your 401 k and now youre going to stop these contributions so you can put more money in as extra fuel for your debt destruction engine
856998 yes i have been contributing at the maximum level allowed since i started at the brewery
856999 hold on a minute youre the big daddy engineer here and if youre against something that says a lot to me but could you just hear me out on this
857000 say on then bubba your 5 000 has purchased the right for a good listen
857001 in the first place my wife and i are not your typical clients
857002 there is no guarantee bubba that you will continue to be higher income folks just because you are now
857003 ok your wife has been ms soybean for 4 years running but eventually her beauty will fade and she will no longer get all these glamorous gigs with agricultural publications and theres not a lot of demand for nuclear physicists in the brewing industry your job is something of an oddity your ceo could come in tomorrow and pull the plug on the whole project you could end up making 30 000 a year in a factory qc lab somewhere testing the elasticity of brassieres
857004 thats assuming bubba that you manage to leave it in there a lot of folks have emergencies every few years and have to draw part of it out
857005 ok but at least theres already something substantial in there to work with even if i stop adding to it if i can leave it in there we should still have something later in our life even if my going for broke strategy doesnt work
857006 i still cant say that i like this but go ahead and tell me exactly what your plan is
857007 we stop the contributions to the 401 k and iras and such
857008 what you are suggesting bubba might actually work better for a lower income couple in their twenties than for a high income couple in their twenties like you and your wife when a high income couple contributes to a tax free plan they enjoy a greater reduction in taxes because you pay a higher tax rate when you cut out contributions to a tax free plan you do not gain as much take home pay as you might think because of the high taxes you pay i still dont like what youre contemplating but i understand where youre coming from i just hate to see a young couple lose the advantage of time for their investments you would be losing the best time to invest in a 401 k which is when youre very young you not only lose the advantage of time but you also lose the benefit of the company matching when you do this ultimately its up to you i cant give you my blessing so to speak but i can give you my prayers if you decide to go ahead and do this thing
857009 maybe you just dont know ever since you said you love me the stars in my sky are all lit up
857010 i dare say my child you havent had much practice have you many years ago when i was your age i always thought of impossible things a half hour every day why sometimes i thought of as many as six impossible things before breakfast

857030 graphic design and photography pros are scrambling to stay viable as barriers to entry fall and stock agencies buy from hobbyists
857031 the largest stock photography business in the world sought to pick the best images from the dabblers who upload their images to flickr allowing getty images to round out their library with images they dont have sufficient holdings of and incorporate images that are already ready to be licensed and whos producers are not as knowledgeable about what their images are worth
857032 the great thing that we see in the emergence of microstock is that its significantly expanding the pool of people paying for imagery
857033 is this for a term paper or an annual report
857034 powazek argues that the people posting jobs on his site who generally offer rewards of 100 or less
857035 one company positioning itself as a photographer friendly alternative to microstock sites with its photoshelter site is bitshelter

857037 when one of lane hartwells photographs showed up without her permission in a popular viral video she wasnt flattered she was frustrated she switched her flickr account to private pulling most of her 5 000 images out of public view
857038 if people expect to sell images like crazy and take business away from getty theyre gonna have to whole heartedly participate in the movement that displaces them photographers who stand on the sidelines with a wait and see mindset have no right to complain about the state of the industry
857039 you cant say my images are worth a premium but you can say i am worth a premium
857040 in fact stories abound about photo buyers who are buying those 1 images and charging the same to their end client as before pocketing a difference that is rightfully due the photographer
857041 it takes a while for a stock library to establish itself it takes a while for sales to start when you have the image a buyer wants when the buyer wants it youll make a sale until then you wont
857042 to argue with a man who has renounced his reason is like giving medicine to the dead
857043 heres a link showing that over 56 000 images on the drr system are indexed
857044 right at this moment 41 of all the pages on photoshelters site map are indexed by google
857045 we take search engine optimization very seriously over 25 of our traffic on the photoshelter collection originates from search engines and we monitor the efficacy of our seo efforts on a daily basis
857046 weve taken several step in order to allow the pages and images for the photoshelter collection to be indexed by automated web spiders most importantly all images on the site can be reached from pages without the use of javascript or flash via our photographer and term directories many sites that use ajax to power their sites do not include the information in a manner accessible by search engines we also provide summaries of a page in the meta description header and when available include keywords about the image our photographer and term index pages include links to rss and atom feeds that provide another mechanism for finding images we provide sitemaps to the major search engines the sitemaps are updated on an hourly basis to provide pages as quickly as possible to search engines and by registering our domains with the major search engines we can monitor our site for any problems that may prevent indexing in addition we are working with search engine vendors to prepare other forms of sitemaps that provide more information about our images
857047 certain applications must be completed on paper and mailed to the copyright office with the appropriate fee and deposit
857048 one of getty images executive vps started contacting us as early as july 2006 initially it was to use photoshelter technology to provide a way for non getty photographers to submit images but once the photoshelter collection was announced they wanted access to our content because we provided ready to license edited content from thousands of contributors around the world they contacted us in july 07 september 07 october 07 and november 07 and we turned them down for one simple reason it was a terrible deal for photographers then as it is now and did very little to alter the fundamental imbalance in the stock industry
857049 how do i start charging my clients for these things now
857050 then how do i get clients that will pay for these things
857051 mastheads org is a great secondary source for photographers for research takes their data a step further by allowing photographers to customized these lists by specialties titles locations hire frequency and much more with you are also paying for these added features which you will not get at i do however recommend getting the service as an extra as it can be helpful
857052 you would still have to analyze the masthead to determine which contacts are of interest to you i e involved in selecting a photographer enter all the information into a database and double check every piece of information to make sure you didnt make any entry mistakes the first time you do this you would also have to check that the address provided in the masthead is the correct address for the contacts of interest to you as generally the contact information provided is for the advertising sales department
857053 say you can scan through a masthead every 5 minutes which is aggressive if you include double checking and breaks its pretty tedious work thats 12 per hour on average if you have a list of 600 magazines that will take about 50 hours even if you have an assistant working for only 10 per hour thats more than the cost of subscribing to a full year editorial edition from adbase that also includes book publishers now thats for only one update if you plan to send out additional mailings throughout the year you will have to update the list again costing your more time and money
857054 agency access also allows the client to download the list as labels telemarketing reports and text files making it easy for the client to send out emails and mailings the advanced tools of allows the photographer to efficiently promote their services in a timely fashion

857090 as the population grows the number of crimes grows with it
857091 im very pleased that council is receptive to the five year hiring plan
857092 i think everyone has the same desire to have a safe community and they realize this is the only way to do it
857093 we have to keep a handle on crime and we have to do the best we can to prevent it deter it and when it does happen to clear it solve it and bring people to justice
857094 when i came here in 1999 we were strictly a patrol department
857095 since that time we have grown into what i call a full service police department
857096 the functions of this facility allow us to better serve the community and give everyone a better experience when they come to the police station
857097 the officers have more room and were getting more done more efficiently
857098 the more we take care of crime now the less we have to worry about it down the road
857099 growth is certainly a challenge but we feel that we are prepared to handle it
857100 the scientific community is really going to run with this
857101 i dont think that an apollo or a manhattan style crash program is what we need we have plenty of technology to solve this problem cost effectively we need to apply it
857102 sure it kills people but you can get private insurance if you dont want to die
857103 uhh umm uhh wheres uhh the umm tel uhh prompt uhh
857104 last gasp of the old guard trying to smash the enthusiasm of the people
857105 yep today you have less freedom but its ok because we are saving the planet
857106 btw you might suggest to greg that he loosen that collar he looks like hes about to stroke out
857107 man you people of seattle can not let this stand
857108 i voted for kerry everyone i know voted for kerry everyone hates bush how did we lose
857109 take away our guns and are you listening keith only the bad guys will have them
857110 it is important to everyone that lives in the area we want to keep the history of it and we wanted to have someone local in it
857111 its a little oasis in the middle of all this commercial square feet
857112 up here one of the big challenges we have is for people to appreciate that this is an issue we need to start working on
857113 theres an assumption that all these new hospitals will take care of the problem and in fact they probably will help alleviate the problem in the near term but in the long term this is going to be a real issue
857114 its going to get them into discussions of why should i have to pay for somebody else although theres a lot of people up here who are very generous and this is a very faith oriented area this area is viewed as so fiscally conservative but faith based people give charitably on average more than non faith based people
857115 that doesnt square very well with people who think philosophically that you need to be more self reliant and step up and be more accountable for taking care of yourself
857116 would a hospital district benefit the hospital yes ultimately i think it would help close the gap that exists specialty care and hospital care is not funded through federally qualified health centers
857117 we would be the core provider of primary care services we would not just have 9 to 5 clinics we would have clinics open seven days a week for 12 to 14 hours a day so that people who needed basic care would have some place to go other than the emergency room
857118 though its not optimal to have someone in your er who just needs basic care hospitals have sort of evolved this dysfunctional economic model that accounts for that they will need to know that a hospital district is permanent before they will let go of that model the only thing worse than having someone come into the er that only needs hydration is having nobody come in
857119 is that we would be for anything that improves the health of the community
857120 wcchd focuses on population health and it is our goal to support community providers in being able to meet the demand for personal medical care services we serve in a very limited safety net role in providing health care for individuals
857121 we try not to duplicate any services in the community that have a funding source
857122 the main area where you could look at and say there is duplication is immunizations
857123 our part in the big picture is to assist the county in providing support and help to people in need of medical care services to monitor the collective health of the communities we serve to provide information on health to communities and individuals and to assist the county and cities in assuring conditions under which people can live safe and healthy lives
857124 the overall trend in job advertisements continues to weaken indicative of a softening in hiring intentions across australia in 2008
857125 the job advertisements series provides further evidence that the current level of interest rates is achieving the rbas desired slowing in domestic economic growth
857126 just as the aging u s population requires more care the number of qualified nurses is shrinking across the nation
857127 federal projections are that employment opportunities for registered nurses are expected to grow faster than the average for all other occupations concordia is proud to help meet this critical workforce need
857128 with the tolls and arterial roads pflugerville is much more attractive to developers
857129 with that the land increases in value the changes in zoning are really an indication of the maturation of the community
857130 the citys code is to notify property owners who live within 500 feet of property being considered for rezoning even though the state only requires 200 feet
857131 the communitys input and involvement is critical though and as a reflection we are researching best practices of notification in other cities we are also working with the pflugerville council of neighborhood associations to begin distributing notifications via e mail to neighborhood leaders
857132 the adjacency concerns are not uncommon and the things we struggle with as a community with regard to adjacency issues are not unique to pflugerville
857133 the challenges that each community faces and how they handle it in their own way is to address adjacency in a way that is acceptable reasonable and appropriate
857134 it comes back to having a comprehensive plan and associated policies goals and objectives that are a reasonable reflection of the communitys wants and desires
857135 so as zonings and developments occur there should be few surprises to the community
857136 there is no home building going on right now and foreclosures are occurring
857137 there is a market for apartments people want to locate here permanently and they need an interim solution
857138 the arrangements of the zoning districts are purposefully scattered and the goal would be to spread them out
857139 planning is not all economic development but economic development is not successful without planning the more employers the city is able to attract to the area the higher the demand there is for various forms of housing and now more than ever people need to live close to where they work the city must encompass a diverse housing stock for us to compete within the region employers look for that when choosing where to locate
857140 if im spending around 200 to 250 million on a project that im going to own in pflugerville forever why would i sell a 2 to 3 million tract of land to greystar if i wasnt confident in what they were going to do with it
857141 we only get to not do what we say were going to do once and then im out of business
857142 but in this particular situation when he told me they would be 70 percent one bedroom i thought yay
857143 if we leave it and there are one to two kids per apartment which is what is likely to happen with the way it was already zoned it would burden the schools
857144 and if we put this many houses on the property which statistics show would likely have 2 5 kids each that would still be over 200 to 300 kids being added to highland park elementary at least with the one bedroom apartments its not going to significantly affect the school
857145 its just not a feasible way to get there and most people wouldnt even know how to get through it
857146 its a swing of millions of dollars to our project but we didnt think the project could move forward
857147 this is obviously a very special piece of land in pflugerville and being at the crossroads of 685 and pecan it would form a visual image of pflugerville
857148 it really needs some out of the box thinking something that would really set the tone for the way pflugerville wants to look
857149 one of the things i hope to try for in the notification is that i will be able to notify not only on zoning changes but also notify neighborhoods about first readings for development conceptual plans
857150 they want to just change the rules so they can build something there
857151 but the neighborhoods are very concerned about the actual building and development thats going to take place there which isnt always addressed in the zoning
857152 i just went to buy a new purse because all of my purses were to put on my shoulder
857153 he didnt say anything he came from behind and grabbed my purse
857154 it may be new students to the town that are not familiar with the area it might be because theyre not necessarily aware of their surroundings that is what they criminals look for in their victims
857155 it is always better not to carry a purse and hide your personal affects either in your pocket or body somewhere
857156 sometimes i walked alone to do laundry but im not doing that anymore
857157 what happened to me can happen anywhere and it happens back in portugal too
857158 how should i do it is there a better way than why should i use branching instead of labels in vss
857159 whats in tfs why should i move how do i move what is there besides version control
857160 i want to move from tfs 2005 to tfs 2008 anything i should know does tfs upgrade also update my databases
857161 dat houdt in dat de jongere bij een weekendongeval een franchise van 250 euro moet betalen we ontraden de jongeren om in het weekend te rijden
857162 we hebben het hier best goed we hebben ons eigen badkamertje en ons eigen gerief het lijkt wel net als vroeger toen we samenwoonden maar dan anders
857163 wanneer we fotos zien van onszelf met twee benen bijvoorbeeld
857164 neem nu de koolwitjes een jaar geleden werden die nog in 93 van de tuinen gespot dit jaar nog maar in 76 van de tuinen
857165 de dagpauwoog gaat van 33 naar 20 de atalanta daalt van 57 tot 40
857166 er zijn steeds minder natuurlijke hoekjes in ons landschap ook de vlaamse tuinen kunnen beter nu zijn ze veel te steriel met weinig inheemse planten en nectarhoudende bloemen en dan is er nog de landbouw met haar pesticiden en meststoffen
857167 users that need to create team projects will still need to be sharepoint instance farm administrators
857168 however i personally doubt this part of our wss story will change for orcas
857169 to resuscitate any living organism after 25 minutes of heart stoppage at room temperature has never been reported and suggests that the time to successful resuscitation in humans may be extended beyond the stubborn figure of 16 minutes that has stood for 50 years
857170 the present study shows that short term high dose hyperbaric oxygen is an effective resuscitation tool and is safe in a small multi place hyperbaric chamber
857171 a rehearsed team can easily load a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest into a small multi place chamber in the pre hospital or hospital setting without interrupting cpr or advanced cardiac life support successful resuscitation at 25 minutes suggests that if high dose hyperbaric oxygen is used at the current acls limit of 16 minutes a greater survival may be achieved in humans and allow application of more definitive treatment such as clot dissolving drugs
857172 there is an increasing capability of the iraqi security forces
857173 they have grown tremendously even in the 11 months weve been here the capability of the iraqi security force has certainly contributed both the army and the police the sons of iraq are part of the security elements in the northern provinces and they have helped in some areas like hawijah samarra and some other places like that
857174 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
857175 so there are good things going on across the board
857176 and you also have to understand that the people of iraq are just tired of the fighting and it doesnt matter if youre sunni kurd shiia christian or syrians youre just sick of this unbelievably bad organization called al qaida which continues to do dastardly things throughout the northern areas and through the rest of the iraq so the people have stood up to these organizations as well
857177 were starting to transition those elements into other organizations such as a civil service corps to help rebuild roads pipelines projects things like that
857178 but were also seeing microgrants and microloans take charge and people actually getting normal work
857179 the government is starting to work a little bit more
857180 this fight were having right now is not over yet
857181 theres still a lot of al qaida in our area they have all come to the northern provinces from baghdad and the west and we continue to have to drive them and pursue them so that they quit fighting give up or we kill or capture them
857182 we came to austin to grow and grow we did
857183 lots of folks think were still wearing cowboy hats have a ranch and an oil well on the back 40
857184 you know they think we have oil stains on all our clothes and some of us do and thats ok but i have to tell people that the texas of the 21st century is not your fathers texas its a different place
857185 attractive cities attract people we live in a capitalistic society this city has a fabulous business ethic and meanwhile remains in having a high quality of life
857186 it is not a question of if we are going to grow we are going to grow the question is how were going to grow
857187 the point of this whole experiment is to see what is out there in the local community and feature it every week
857188 the logistics of it and how it appears on site are not as important to me as the forward thinking city who has decided to showcase itself on its own land
857189 all i know is we lost a ton of money
857190 its a big blow everybody is shuffling trying to figure out what we can do
857191 they just may not be finished on the schedule wed planned on
857192 its a policy decision for us and the cities to decide if we want to do that
857193 i think the consensus is at least in the county we cant build and rebuild every state highway in williamson county it would bankrupt us and the tax rate would be unbelievably high but in certain areas there is so much demand and need that we need to go ahead and step in
857194 we are trying to make sure that if at some point in time the txdot money starts flowing again that we get reimbursed
857195 we want it to be as fair to our taxpayers as possible but we are just growing so fast we have to make road improvements
857196 with a county growing as fast as williamson county we agree we have to get these roads taken care of whatever way we can do it
857197 especially with all the budget cuts we were thankful the three pass through projects were not affected
857198 however what has happened is a slow down in the planning and design of some projects
857199 at the end of the day the citizens really look to us and they dont know whether it is a txdot road or a city road or a county road
857200 they want us to fix it and so that is what we are going about doing
857201 the bottom line is for fiscal year 2008 which began in february we stopped our construction program 1 1 billion worth of construction projects in texas will be delayed for the balance of the fiscal year
857202 this is a difficult situation for everyone we recognize that and were going to do everything we can to work with local authorities to help them make the most of the revenues they have
857203 oh youre the first photographer ive talked with that has a problem with
857204 the governor frustrated by the nearly monthlong impasse had been expected to sign an executive order monday cutting pay for about 200 000 state workers to the federal minium wage level of 6 55 an hour their wages would be restored with back pay when a new budget is enacted
857205 also monday senate president pro tem don perata d oakland canceled his plans to force a budget vote on the senate floor today saying negotiations have been moving forward and he doesnt want to jeopardize the talks
857206 the two moves could take the heat off the contentious debate over the states 17 2 billion deficit which includes 2 billion in reserves and could lead to a compromise soon political observers said
857207 it looks like theres enough momentum at the moment to cease fire and to see if they can reach an agreement said larry gerston a political science professor at san jose state university
857208 i dont want to subject the state of california to legal liability chiang said under the fair labor standards act if we do not pay full wage we may be subject to treble damages that would only exacerbate an already difficult financial situation
857209 the legal picture grew even more muddled when state sen
857210 its a game of legal who will blink first chicken but then the whole budget battle falls into that category
857211 supporters of proposition 8 the proposed state constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage said they would file suit today to block a change made by california atty
857212 petitions circulated to qualify the initiative for the ballot said the measure would amend the state constitution
857213 in a move made public last week and applauded by same sex marriage proponents the attorney generals office changed the language to say that proposition 8 seeks to
857214 jennifer kerns spokeswoman for the protect marriage coalition called the new language
857215 proponents of the measure said they want voters to see ballot language similar to what was on the petitions that began circulating last fall
857216 this is a complete about face from the ballot title that was assigned when the measure was being circulated for signatures kerns said
857217 port authorities said they intended to proceed with the air quality initiative
857218 truck pollution is a serious threat to public health including the health of truck drivers said

857229 schwarzenegger plans to sign the executive order this week the exact wording of the order has not been finalized but a draft order would cut pay for about 200 000 state workers to the federal minimum wage of 6 55 an hour until a budget is signed
857230 schwarzenegger spokesman aaron mclear said he would not speculate about whether the governor would go to court to force chiang to comply with his order
857231 according to the statewide poll by jmm research of sacramento brown himself a former governor looking for a repeat performance would be the top choice of 31 percent of the registered democrats surveyed if the primary were held today
857232 but if you add feinstein to the mix and take out newsom villaraigosa and oconnell figuring they might bow out if she jumps in brown drops to 24 percent and the states senior senator grabs 50 percent
857233 representatives of those groups which have formed overlapping coalitions with names like
857234 its not unusual for us to get involved every year and yet what i think is different this year is that it is so much more field driven said state employees international union spokeswoman
857235 california businesses led by the california chamber of commerce calchamber the california taxpayers association and the howard jarvis taxpayers association have spent millions and successfully enlisted the gop to advocate for their interests over the years
857236 in california it takes a two thirds vote of each house in the legislature to pass a budget or a tax increase
857237 this year with the budget already 28 days late and the state 15 2 billion short of a balanced budget business groups are pushing to ensure their interests are taken care of as the budget is shaped with that push comes money
857238 calchamber the highest profile business group has spent more than 11 5 million to influence elected officials since gov arnold schwarzenegger assumed office in late 2003 according to disclosure forms filed with the secretary of states office
857239 in other words californians in the aggregate are now paying almost as much of their personal income in taxes now as they were before proposition 13 was passed and our relative ranking has also climbed upward to no 12 in 2007 a half percent higher than the national average
857240 that half percent translates into about 8 billion which happens to be just about what democrats want in new taxes
857241 what goes around comes around as political veterans are wont to say
857242 some analysts contend that the tactic even if it doesnt reduce business at the hotels could prove effective by persuading other potential donors to proposition 8 to stay out of the battle
857243 they will probably succeed in getting business owners that are hesitant to avoid giving said tony quinn co editor of the target book which analyzes california politics its a tough tactic but it may be a wise tactic
857244 manchester who has donated to a variety of largely republican political causes including contributing a total of 147 450 in 2006 said he was surprised by the boycott
857245 its a first amendment freedom of speech issue manchester said i certainly didnt want to offend anybody
857246 in one way the boycott may have been effective already
857247 manchester said he contributed because of his strong catholic faith the church opposes same sex marriage but said he doesnt expect to give any more money to proposition 8
857248 thousands more california students will have to find their own way to school this fall as districts slash bus routes to cope with budget shortfalls and high fuel costs
857249 critics worry that the cuts will increase traffic around schools shift costs to parents already struggling with rising gas prices and prompt more absenteeism hurting students academic achievement

857251 california public students will stick to reading writing and arithmetic gov arnold schwarzenegger decided as he vetoed a bill late friday that would have required climate change be added to schools curriculum
857252 in january the state senate approved the bill sb 908 by a 26 13 vote only two republicans supported the proposal
857253 in his veto statement schwarzenegger said he supported education that spotlights the dangers of climate change however the republican governor said he was opposed to educational mandates from sacramento
857254 it is a discovery that has startled any number of california homeowners
857255 de la torre d south gate decided that wasnt good enough this year he proposed a law that would require racially restrictive covenants it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands statewide to be stricken from the public record at the time of the next sale
857256 the bill has run into stiff opposition from real estate agents title insurance companies and county recorders who complain that it would be expensive and create a bureaucratic nightmare that could slow real estate transactions to little purpose since the covenants are already illegal
857257 iowa doesnt have any all nude strip clubs but it does have performing arts centers where women dance naked
857258 it all began on july 21 2007 when a 17 year old niece of sheriff steven macdonald climbed up on stage at shotgun geniez in hamburg and stripped off her clothing owner clarence judy was charged with violating iowas public indecent exposure law
857259 the clubs owner michael murphy said his establishment bans anyone under 18 from entering the five year old business
857260 it used to be said that state leaders couldnt get a budget deal until the temperatures in the capital city topped 100 degrees
857261 one other thing we can be fairly certain of at this point the final package will not solve the states fiscal problems
857262 u ntil legislators and gov arnold schwarzenegger agree on a new budget
857263 under various state laws and constitutional provisions the controller is prevented from paying vendors for goods and services provided after july 1 when the states new fiscal year begins

857265 backers of proposition 8 argued that they are not trying to eliminate anyones rights but are simply seeking to restore the definition of marriage that existed in california before may 15 when the state supreme court struck down the law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman
857266 brown whose office prepares the title and summary of each measure on the state ballot chose wording for both that is
857267 the suit asks a judge to order a different title such as

857270 businesses often steer clear of ballot measures that deal with social issues for fear of alienating customers
857271 but pg amp e officials said the san francisco based companys effort to defeat proposition 8 on the nov 4 ballot is consistent with its long time advocacy of equality for all

857273 jennifer kerns a spokeswoman for the yes on 8 campaign said campaign officials were not surprised by pg amp es announcement

857275 according to a draft of the governors lottery plan obtained by the bee schwarzenegger would propose a state constitutional amendment that tribes say could override a california supreme court decision that outlawed the game
857276 this attempts to walk right to the edge by trying to preserve the tribes revenue while expanding the lottery said attorney howard dickstein who represents the united auburn tribe near sacramento its a bold and dramatic departure from the status quo
857277 lottery director joan borucki denied the state is trying to legalize keno she said the language is intended to allow the lottery to hand out fixed prizes for lower level jackpots in multistate games such as mega millions
857278 the cost of new housing for san quentin state prisons growing number of death row inmates will exceed estimates by nearly 40 million and the compound could run out of space soon after it is completed according to a state auditors report released tuesday
857279 californias prison system is already a big ticket item representing about 10 percent of roughly 100 billion general fund spending
857280 seth unger a spokesman for the california department of corrections and rehabilitation said the latest figures for the san quentin project are estimates at best
857281 one of the states top environmental officials embraced the idea of banning plastic bags in california tuesday citing the devastating impact on marine animals which die after ingesting plastic bags or becoming entangled in them
857282 other ideas under consideration include imposing fees or regulations on producers of plastic food packaging another big contributor to ocean debris and cracking down on beach litter such as cigarette butts
857283 there is no question these kinds of steps are critical if were going to address the issue of marine debris in a serious way chrisman said in a statement
857284 the notion of banning plastic bags is clearly spreading several cities including san francisco and los angeles have adopted measures to severely restrict them san jose officials are currently working with business owners on a plan to phase them out plastic bag use in ireland has plunged 95 percent since that country adopted a tax on their distribution in 2002 according to research conducted by the council
857285 the bill to allow online registration sb381 co authored by state sen ron calderon d montebello has rolled through the state senate with few complaints and awaits final approval by the assembly before going to gov arnold schwarzenegger
857286 arizona and washington already have such systems and online registrations there are surging while would be california voters now can fill out the voter registration form online from the secretary of states web site they must print the form sign it and mail it to their county election office
857287 calderons bill would computerize the entire process by allowing the secretary of state to replace the personal signature with the digitized signatures already online for people who have received california drivers licenses and identification cards
857288 i get a very positive energy about that its clear this is something he would like to do and he has a very strong personality and i feel hell get it

857292 there is a very wide global range in the odds of survival after a cancer diagnosis
857293 some of the range is understandable on the basis of the relative wealth of these countries
857294 the differences are large across the u s a and even in different metropolitan areas
857295 this is not a question of the competence of doctors in any particular country
857296 this is an issue of the overall effectiveness of health services
857297 where the system is either slow in diagnosis has too few doctors has very few radiotherapy machines or in some countries none you would expect differences in outcome and thats what these overall survival estimates are helping us provide
857298 the world needs to wake up to the fact that cancer is the second leading cause of death all over the place
857299 the world needs to smell the coffee and realize cancer can be prevented and cancer can be cured if found early
857300 its very hard to extrapolate from this finding to comment on the benefits of red wine directly because red wine has many other compounds besides resveratrol including ethanol which have very active biological effects
857301 and in this mouse study we have shown that this particular compound has very strong positive effects on preventing heart inflammation keeping bone health in terms of structure and function and maintaining loco motor and balance activity so if these effects translate into humans it will have a very good impact on the standard of human health
857302 but we cant have half of america going permanently on a diet
857303 we just cant do it its not practical and its not going to happen
857304 but by looking at specific outcomes in specific tissues this work is certainly more detailed and rigorous
857305 and it further supports the hypothesis that this compound staves off the effects of aging
857306 this is the same as any other part of the body its what we in vascular surgery refer to as the use it or lose it concept
857307 regular intercourse has an important role in preserving erectile function among elderly men whereas morning erection does not exert a similar effect
857308 continued sexual activity decreases the incidence of erectile dysfunction in direct proportion to coital frequency
857309 what is very hot these days is what we can do to rehabilitate people who develop erection problems after prostate cancer surgery or radiation therapy

857312 about 10 years ago we showed that obstructive sleep apnea has a powerful effect on the sympathetic nervous system causing an acute increase in adrenaline flow that study was followed by another showing that sudden death at night is more common for people with sleep apnea
857313 for those who had heart attacks at night the vast majority had undiagnosed sleep apnea
857314 so perhaps sleep apnea is acting as a trigger for night time heart attacks
857315 it showed that people with sleep apnea who refused treatment had a three to fourfold increased risk of cardiac events
857316 only about 60 percent of women with high blood pressure are having it controlled

857320 sometimes the womans needs arent being met at the doctors office
857321 they need to ask the simple question what is my blood pressure and if it seems a little elevated they need to talk to a doctor about what to do to fix it
857322 theyre not as easy to do as some things but they are very powerful
857323 those low fat diary products are great because they have calcium which is good for our bones so theres more than one benefit
857324 when youre going to the market and buying prepared foods purchase those that are grilled not fried
857325 you also should realize many condiments are very high in salt
857326 the potential attractiveness of a vaccine is it might be a more convenient way to manage high blood pressure in some people
857327 people should not be anticipating this is something that would be clinically available anytime in the near future

857330 i always like to remind people of the importance of simple things in lifestyle that can make a difference
857331 wed teach them some skills one week and theyd come back the next week bubbling over with excitement that theyd talked with their teen about relationships love or sex and this was the best part their teen had actually engaged in a real conversation with them or role played a topic like how to say no to unwanted sexual advances
857332 many employers provide programs to help employees lose weight or stop smoking
857333 we wanted to see if we could apply worksite health promotion principles to help parents address their kids sexual health it turned out that employers loved the idea they are under pressure to create family friendly workplaces and theyre often providing the health insurance for these kids so they are concerned about lost productivity when parents are distracted with their kids sexual health issues
857334 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
857335 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made

857337 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday

857339 the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
857340 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
857341 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
857342 al qaida is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
857343 in this time of war america is grateful to all the men and women who have stepped up forward to defend us
857344 understand that we have no greater responsibility than to stop the terrorists before they launch another attack on our homeland
857345 and every day they make great sacrifices to keep the american people safe here at home we owe our thanks to all those who wear the uniform and their families who support them in their vital work and the best way to honor them is to support their mission and to bring them home with victory

857348 managers do things right while leaders do the right thing

857351 its very useful in situations where you may have only one to two interpreters on the ground and about 80 to 90 soldiers on the ground so you may not have enough interpreters to go around in a particular situation
857352 the real beauty of it is that the technology has been designed so that anyone who hasnt had any training on it can use it
857353 soldiers see that this will help them to reduce mistakes and misunderstandings because they will be able to communicate with the local population
857354 soldiers are wearing 80 pounds of gear already so it was important for them to have something that is light weight very compact and that fits into a small pouch
857355 the device can be attached to their arm so their hands are always free
857356 by using commercial off the shelf software there are a plethora of items you can add to it
857357 the vcommunicator gives soldiers a full customization capability where they can download maps photos videos new missions and new vocabulary
857358 all they need to do is point to the map displayed on the screen and use the vcommunicator to communicate phrases such as shows me on the map
857359 i have tremendous pride in my job getting to do this and you can see the light in the eyes of the soldiers and its interesting when you go to conferences and hear them say this will make my life so much easier
857360 its easy to use and it offers a lot of applications
857361 its better than any system ive seen out there especially with it having an ipod so there are a lot of things it can do and it has a lot of promise
857362 i cant wait to actually see it in use in the field
857363 this will ease the burden on our forces and it will make life easier for our wonderful military families

857367 i was trying to figure out the guy because id never faced him before
857368 i was trying to get something out over the plate i put good swings on it i think ive had more hits there right field than i did all last year
857369 when we got to the fifth i thought maybe that would be my last inning
857370 but i didnt throw too many pitches in the sixth he trusted me to go back out there and that was good
857371 its a great time to be part of the rangers organization
857372 i left a couple of pitches over the plate against a good hitting team and they capitalized on those mistakes
857373 ive got to learn to stay within myself and not overthrow
857374 the abandonment of ones religious faith a political party ones principles or a cause
857375 doesnt that really defeat the purpose of spending the day at home with my kids if all three of us plug into our own entertainment sources
857376 you read your emily dickinson and i my robert frost and we note our place with bookmarkers that measure what weve lost
857377 i only kiss your shadow i cannot feel your hand youre a stranger now unto me lost in the dangling conversations and the superficial sighs of the borders of our lives
857378 george bush isnt a real conservative real conservatives can still win elections
857379 you shouldnt have volunteered and you should get out as soon as possible
857380 you can take a boy out of new mexico but extracting new mexico from a boy is much more difficult
857381 back in 1957 when i had two of the biggest hits in the country no one would let me sing publicly anywhere
857382 2001 ten times years later when we were both in high school i would ask him if hes still fascinated by computers or if hes a scientist
857383 tell them what youre going to tell them tell them and then tell them what youve told them
857384 there have been a number of partial explorations in this direction but nothing near a complete system has been created to our knowledge

857400 i was actually a little bit sorer yesterday than today the sophomore from georgia said
857401 do you really believe that god parted the red sea for your forefathers yet somehow that same god does not care passionately about you
857402 what did you ask me to do last which i havent done
857403 what do i need to do so i can hear your voice again and hear it more often
857404 what did god tell them last which they have ignored
857405 in the past god overlooked such ignorance but now he commands all people everywhere to repent 31for he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed he has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead
857406 there is no news in the truth and there is no truth in the news
857407 developed by women for women and they named it rely
857408 just look under lawn care in the phone book try to find someone who is oriental because most of them are buddhists they care about nature and they know how to develop a relationship with your lawn instead of just mowing it
857409 this is just about average here weve had several bigger ones than this already this summer
857410 for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
857411 behold i tell you a mystery we will not all sleep but we who trust christ for salvation will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed
857412 it may be the devil or it may be the lord but youve got to serve somebody
857413 he was further permitted to wage war on gods holy people the saints and to overcome them and power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation
857414 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
857415 i know that a lot of americans go down to mexico as tourists but other than tourism what industries does mexico have what can americans import more of from mexico or what sort of businesses flourish in mexico
857416 it took mexico longer to rid ourselves of the spanish and the french and we have not had enough time as an independent people to develop our own industries
857417 how long would it have taken mexicans to put a man on the moon
857418 give them maps and water give them amnesty and make them legal immigrants
857419 19 of the past 21 major civilizations collapsed from within

857423 we love you youre still our daughter we just want you to be happy
857424 mom and dad ive been thinking about the opportunities available to young people these days i have given a lot of thought to what would be the most fulfilling career for me and i have chosen a life of crime dont worry i wont do anything really dumb like robbing banks those people always get caught i will be a smart criminal the opportunities are endless and i expect to be wealthy without depending on you besides i have always felt an inner defiance which i need to express since i was very small i have felt that i am truly a criminal trapped in a cheney body i know youll understand
857425 ive been out for 9 years now this is my 6th album if any of these claims had any validity to em wouldnt it have been said by now i mean if he felt like this why didnt he say this when he was promoting laffy taffy
857426 i figured if i was brave enough to donate a kidney i was brave enough to go to court for a child
857427 maybe people are more likely to report child abuse if the family is a minority maybe the system works more diligently if the children are white other people think the poverty rates in communities of color lead to so many problems including child abuse
857428 meanwhile if youre a minority child the system is a rough place to be
857429 casas like sheila have a great benefit in meeting the parents and children reducing the fear that a white government system will treat them poorly people in the familys community are more likely to trust and talk to a casa if they see a person like themselves
857430 she had trouble with the system because of the way she communicated
857431 so the police go in and see an empty refrigerator clothes in boxes so of course she doesnt look like a fit mother
857432 the mother resolved her legal issues got counseling she needed and was able to build a support base the girls eventually went home
857433 my low point is when a child is returned home when i dont think he should be

857445 this boy is very active some teacher will want to put him on ritalin
857446 if i stop taking it after a few days i just cant stop crying
857447 maybe you need to cry maybe its the healthiest thing you can do and maybe youll never really feel better until you do maybe masking your emotions with medication is just going to cause them to build up to an explosion from which you never will recover or suppress them until you cant feel anything
857448 a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest and poverty will come on you like a robber and scarcity like an armed man
857449 das besondere b se an der unterdr ckung der meinungsfreiheit liegt darin begraben da sie die menschheit unsere nachfahren ebenso wie die heutige generation beraubt und zwar jene die einer meinung nicht zustimmen sogar noch mehr als jene die sie vertreten falls die meinung richtig ist wird ihnen die m glichkeit vorenthalten denkfehler durch die wahrheit zu ersetzen falls sie aber falsch ist verlieren sie was beinahe ein ebenso gro er vorteil ist n mlich die klarere wahrnehmung und den lebendigeren eindruck der wahrheit die durch deren zusammenprall mit irrtum entstehen

857457 this doesnt sound like something our son would write it actually sounds like something eric harris or dylan kleibold might have written when they were nine years old
857458 1but the holy spirit distinctly and expressly declares that in latter times some will turn away from the faith giving attention to deluding and seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach 2through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared cauterized 3who forbid people to marry and teach them to abstain from certain kinds of foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and have an increasingly clear knowledge of the truth 4for everything god has created is good and nothing is to be thrown away or refused if it is received with thanksgiving 5for it is hallowed and consecrated by the word of god and by prayer
857459 he spoke az one who had authority and not as their scribes
857460 these are the rules and this is against the rules
857461 i think the protesters should be allowed to drag the legislators out into the streets and do whatever they want to do with them
857462 she was crying her eyes out i saw her makeup coming off
857463 since this incident only involved one student couldnt that student have been moved to another teachers fourth grade class for the remaining six weeks of the school year causing minimal disruption to my sons class and allowing my sons teacher to search for other employment next fall if this school did not wish to retain her services
857464 my son came home yesterday with a long list of fourth graders who cried because of what took place in their classroom yesterday including himself if this teacher really needed to be terminated shouldnt it have been done at the end of the day so as to minimize the emotional distress to her class
857465 given the short time between the incident and the dismissal was your lawyer concerned about fairness and justice to all of the parties involved and hearing everyones side regarding whatever happened
857466 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god
857467 i ate a lot of fruits and vegetables but not too many of course

857484 god likes all kinds of music even if you dont
857485 where have all the flowers gone and when will they ever learn
857486 its possible that in the future pittsburgh hospitals could get involved
857487 given the time line to get the assessment in place by 2009 it made sense to focus on one jurisdiction
857488 have demonstrated it can be done and increase medical assistance payments to hospitals
857489 this is an accepted practice and brings federal dollars to strengthen the overall health care system
857490 the government have taken the approach that there is not and never was a schools crisis in dublin 15
857491 a lot of these guys are hard working guys with good jobs this is their hobby
857492 everybody comes from all over the entire u s its fun to travel and meet everyone again each year
857493 you would have seen a sight you would never have seen before there were bikes as far as you can see
857494 everything is a blur right now and we dont know anything for sure
857495 but i heard there were five casualties overall one interpreter and the other four were soldiers
857496 he knew of those guys but he didnt know them
857497 his main goal since seventh grade was that he wanted to go to west point and he knew what it took to get there
857498 he was an outstanding student always dedicated to his school work but he also knew how to have fun he was an a plus guy
857499 he was a great kid a perfect gentleman everyone got along with him he always found a way to make you laugh
857500 he was among the best and the brightest and he went on to pursue his dream attending west point
857501 when were done with the construction we expect the majority to be sold were getting good prices which is tough to do in a market like this
857502 weve really seen a big difference with the tax abatement its been a huge attraction for us
857503 its hard to make light of that especially given that youre going to have to spend a minimum of 300 000 to go into the building
857504 i think theyve got their hands full trying to make these things happen
857505 the pace of trying to get office or retail tenants into town can be fairly lengthy
857506 were being pretty picky about who we bring in we want the right use we dont want to fill it up we want it to be something unique
857507 its about tackling housing rehabilitation one neighborhood at a time
857508 i grew up in these neighborhoods and the housing revitalization that we see happening in braddock and much of the mon valley is the truest form of change i have seen in many years
857509 there has been little or no investment of this kind in the mon valley for years and we now see that people dont want to leave these communities if they have good and affordable housing
857510 we are beginning to see what we have been talking about for years
857511 the success of what we do depends on the strength of the community groups we work with and their commitment to identifying neighborhoods where we could make an impact
857512 what we have found is that there are many nice houses in all of these neighborhoods but people often cant see that because of all the blight around them
857513 we try to tackle such neighborhoods with expansive projects like a 25 house construction that can actually change the look of a neighborhood
857514 we dont want the blight to spread many times we see neighborhoods which have pretty nice houses but then a few abandoned properties in the same area have the capacity to create other abandoned properties and absentee landlords
857515 what we see mvi doing in the mon valley is a model of what we want to see happening in other parts of the state
857516 it is a model of housing redevelopment that i hope places like philadelphia lancaster reading harrisburg and york will adopt
857517 as always shakespeare got it right when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions

857521 of course there is room for better value for money in public spending
857522 the government have signalled that more severe cutbacks could yet be on the way in december s budget
857523 we need to focus on achieving stability in the public finances restoring confidence in the economy and re starting growth in employment and incomes
857524 it is important to continue investment in future jobs and incomes
857525 ireland s competitive advantage is increasingly built on knowledge based industries
857526 it is essential that measures are put in place to avoid the emergence of a new group of long term unemployed
857527 these are the concrete steps that labour would pursue in government to return ireland to its path of sustainable long term growth
857528 no ills can evil doers perpetrate all that happens is willed by the lord

857551 our program started back in 2006 and our whole goal is to decrease re admissions and also to help improve the health status of our patients help improve their quality of life
857552 compare three months prior to entering the program compared to three months after entering the program weve seen an 80 percent reduction in hospital encounters as well as a decrease in their length of stay

857559 i started out thinking that people might be interested in what a real estate professional has to say about buying and selling homes
857560 now it seems that the audience is composed of people who want to tell real estate professionals what they know about buying and selling homes
857561 im not speaking from the perspective of someone who has something to sell but rather just a guy that is taking in a ton of information and trying to process it all to make it easier for other people to get beyond the sales pitches and find out whats really going on

857566 i dont trust breslow in a high leverage situation yet
857567 because a pitcher must pitch at least a half inning to get the save
857568 the change towards gathering the save was more gradual than you might think
857569 francisco liriano got a chance to see that he wasnt ready to pitch in the majors quite yet something that it seemed neither he nor his agent was so quick to believe out of spring training
857570 but was ullger sticking with guerrier because he thought guerrier was the designated eighth inning guy if gardy would have been making the moves would it have been done differently because hes more comfortable second guessing himself than ullger is second guessing his boss

857595 as did ancient philosophy at the times of clement of alexandria and origen existentialist philosophy may serve and for many has already served as a pedagogue towards christ existentialism can be ecclesialized in the way that ancient philosophy was ecclesialized by the greek fathers in the 3rd and 4th centuries
857596 moreover the conceptual language of existentialism which doubtless is closer to persons today than that of the ancient philosophy employed by the greek fathers may be used if not for the formation of a neo patristic synthesis then at least for the interpretation of its main elements in the language of our contemporaries
857597 she just knows how to use what shes got youre kinda spastic
857598 you have no sense of self no confidence you have a great body but no idea how to use it you trip you flail when you try and act sexy its almost comical but in a painful way you even hug self consciously
857599 i dont know how you do it but you do
857600 i honestly think confidence is more important than any of it
857601 why do those 10 pounds matter to you losing 10 pounds puts your bmi into the unhealthy range why would you want that
857602 because people like me better when im that skinny i get more compliments people are nicer to me people trust me more i swear i even get more google hits on those days
857603 maybe its because youre more confident and other people pick up on it maybe it has nothing to do with your weight and everything to do with how you feel about yourself
857604 do you mean 900 microseconds or 100 microseconds because thats a world of difference to us
857605 customers asked us to migrate linux and open source further into the data center
857606 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
857607 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
857608 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
857609 he has promised he would veto every bill that has them barack obama has voted for bills that are laden with pork whether its the 2005 bush cheney energy bill the 2008 agricultural subsidy bill both of those john mccain voted against because they were laden with pork both of those barack obama voted for
857610 john mccain has been very explicit in saying he does not support an increase in payroll taxes particularly because they impact small businesses and sole proprietorships more greatly than any other part of our economy
857611 his record is very clear on that and he has a number of economists who support his assertion that we can solve the social security and medicare crisis but particularly social security without raising payroll taxes
857612 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely to continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
857613 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
857614 i certainly agree with him that the situation could get worse
857615 and there are a couple of things that will make it worse one is to raise taxes which is what senator obama proposes to do another is to massively increase government spending which is what senator obama would propose to do over 1 5 trillion in increased government spending and the third is to become isolationist and protectionist which senator obama would also propose to do
857616 what senator obama said is that hell have a middle class tax cut and that tax cut will go to roughly 95 percent of all the people whose incomes are under 250 000
857617 for people whose incomes are in excess of 250 000 their income tax rates will go back to the rates we had under president clinton their capital gains rate will go up to some rate less than the rate we had during most of the time president clinton was in office taxes on dividends will go up to the rate that will apply to capital gains and that will be substantially below the rate that was in place when president clinton was elected
857618 what he said with respect to offshore drilling is its going to have no effect in the short term zero that its going to take years for this to come on board
857619 on the other hand youre referring to the proposal that came up friday in which offshore drilling was a piece of a much larger piece of legislation
857620 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive
857621 and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy
857622 more and more people are really thinking about the environment in ways they hadnt before

857701 an increase in the federal excise tax on beer could be crippling to each one of us and any proposal on this front must be opposed and defeated

857803 im not some cute little indian boy who grew up in america with political aspirations
857804 i just thought it would be kind of funny to create an e mail address based on a random senator whose name no one could spell

857810 tobaccos tools are analog synths tape machines and deformed incantations from throats unknown his music is a wash of distortion and melody over jagged beats it amalgamates hypnotic cosmopolitan pop gritty propulsive hip hop and a night full of fevered dreams it buoys the spirit braces the nerves and smuggles disoriented paranoia deep into the subconscious these are anxiously driven effortlessly smooth and unapologetically badass sounds of inner nature
857811 you may all go to hell and i will go to texas

857813 bruce mirken of the marijuana policy project sends the photo below its from a series of l a times photos from a federal raid on a medical marijuana clinic in california i wouldnt draw too many conclusions from it but it is a little disconcerting
857814 as a u s marine i would have faced charges for simply wearing my camouflage utility uniform into a store
857815 there are these things called standards that the corps and other military and police groups are obligated to follow it is to avoid giving someone the wrong idea about who you are and your application in society i guess blackwater and the federal marijuana plant warriors dont care what people think
857816 what is most disturbing is the claim of several blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal government and the state of louisiana
857817 that raises a key question under what authority are blackwaters men operating a spokesperson for the homeland security department russ knocke told the washington post he knows of no federal plans to hire blackwater or other private security
857818 theyre marketing their services to not only foreign governments but to fortune 500 corporations
857819 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians
857820 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
857821 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
857822 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
857823 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability
857824 malta is the operational base of blackwater the organiser of private military militia which are increasingly taking on more and more roles which used to be undertaken by us forces in iraq and elsewhere
857825 as long as i have contracts i can buy fully automatic weapons
857826 were talking about 24 sailors at a time training them in an indoor facility
857827 fundamental issues of discretion and the right of the city council to make land use decisions
857828 harm lasting months or even years after the acts were inflicted upon the prisoners
857829 as the first trial in the administrations military commissions the hamdan case will test the limits of a deeply flawed and unconstitutional system
857830 at every step of the way it has become painfully clear that these ad hoc tribunals are no substitute for american civilian and military courts where the constitution still means something lets end this farce and make a fresh start in a system that reflects our nations core values
857831 congress and state officials need to learn more about fusion centers engage in some very pointed inquiry about the effectiveness and the precise role of these centers and at a minimum put in place strong checks and balances
857832 too often weve given our government new powers to fight terrorists only to have them used against peace activists and other innocent americans this cant be the future of law enforcement congress needs to end private sector participation and military involvement in law enforcement we need to learn from our mistakes not repeat them

857838 a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000
857839 the largest most pervasive global evangelical network ever to exist
857840 make a priority of establishing as a minimum a pioneer church planting movement within every ethno linguistic people of over 10 000 individuals by december 31 2000
857841 highlight all the least reached peoples non christian of the world and to help build ministry networks and partnerships focusing on these people
857842 just as joshua sent out the spies to survey the land and report on its condition before the children of israel moved out in obedience to gods command many more missionaries and christian workers are finding research information invaluable in laying their plans
857843 the mission of joshua project ii is to highlight the peoples of the world who have the least exposure to the gospel of jesus christ joshua project ii seeks to accomplish this through information sharing and networking the mission of the joshua project is threefold first to gather manage and distribute strategic population progress indicator and ministry activity information to maximise the visibility of the least reached peoples to the church the goal is a comprehensive accurate validated public ally available list of all the ethno cultural people groups of the world second to be a least reached peoples networking resource to the christian mission community third to enhance the flow of information between great commission organisations by using standardised data coding
857844 promote networking and partnerships focusing on least reached peoples in order to promote the flow of strategic ministry activity information between individuals churches denominations and mission agencies
857845 as part of this work an address namely workers together in us was contacted to my surprise a pastor of the brethren church contacted me from my own town his residence was only 1km away from that of mine he called me over telephone and invited me for a personal meeting on visiting his house he handed over to me an oxford edition of the bible printed in new york and a few booklets and pamphlets what astonished me was that the pastor had with him a copy of letter which i had sent to us on enquiring about how the nearness of my residence with that of the pastor was understood by the party at bangalore he showed me an official directory of the list of the evangelicals working in india with their family photographs and complete details arranged in order of pin codes another directory of their worldwide network was also shown to me
857846 we need a church within cycling distance then within walking distance and finally within hearing distance
857847 never before has this kind of information on india been so carefully surveyed prepared well published and distributed we do not believe it is accidental
857848 sil had helped gather anthropological information on the tarascan indians that ended up in nelson rockefellers intelligence files the files contained cross references to reveal behavioural patterns among indian peoples in everything from socialisation including aggressive tendencies and personality traits drives emotions and language structure to political intrigue kinship ties traditional authority mineral resources exploitation and labor relations rockefeller called these data the strategic index of latin america
857849 any foreigner living in a foreign culture already comes under a natural suspicion if this policy is reversed it would totally erode the ministry of missionaries
857850 for intelligence agencies to seek any relationship whatsoever with our religious workers must be unequivocally prohibited
857851 president bush shows little appreciation or understanding of the separation of church and state bush is closely aligned with ultra conservative christian groups that have opposed church state separation for years it is obvious they have great influence over his domestic and foreign policy agendas
857852 strikes at the heart of the religious freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment
857853 the religious right organisations and fundamentalist protestants groups have way too much influence over the bush administration sadly many americans do not follow foreign policy decisions with the exception of the war in iraq and are either not aware of what is happening or more often simply do not care as a result we are on the verge of dismantling the wall of separation of church and state in america a policy that if enacted is bound to have negative repercussions around the world as fundamentalist interpretations of christianity increasingly become the basis for foreign policy
857854 my heart is on missions and on getting people into the kingdom of god thats the main thrust of my life
857855 no new missionaries are allowed after 1984 however short term visas are being issued to the foreigners who are coming only in administrative capacity to review working of their organisations etc
857856 hinduism and many of the occult activities that come out of the orient are inspired by demons and demon worship theres this concept that all religions are the same and all are good that is not true the worship of the devil is not good
857857 robertsons operation blessing a 66 million a year agency also has a controversial history the controversy over operation blessing stretches back to 1994 when robertson used his 700 club daily cable television programme to raise funds for the charity robertson told viewers operation blessing was using cargo planes to aid refugees from rwanda who had fled into the neighbouring nation of zaire now known as congo to escape a violent civil war in fact robertson was using his planes to haul mining equipment in and out of zaire for african development corporation his for profit diamond mining company
857858 a procession of religious leaders who have met with him testify to his faith while websites encourage people to fast and pray for the president
857859 in every instance when my administration sees a responsibility to help people we will look first to faith based institutions to charities and to community groups that have shown their ability to save and change lives
857860 planted a mustard seed in my heart and i started to change it was the beginning of a new walk where i would recommit my heart to jesus christ
857861 no one can honestly believe that a program funded with tax dollars which requires as a major component of treatment the acceptance of jesus christ as lord and saviour will not advance religion
857862 innerchange is an intensive bible centered program ostensibly open to inmates of all religious persuasions but every month inmates are evaluated on whether they
857863 those inmates who fail to show the proper level of piety are removed and lose the special freedoms and privileges dangled before inmates as incentives to participate

857868 the adp supports local churches by running leadership training courses for pastors and church leaders
857869 canadian missionaries have worked in the area for just over 50 years and today 85 90 percent of the community is christian however local church leaders had little understanding of the importance of their role in community development adp staff build relationships with these leaders to improve church co operation and participation in development initiatives
857870 opposition to christian workers and organisations flares up occasionally in this area generally from those with vested interests in tribal people remaining illiterate and powerless wv supports local churches by organising leadership courses for pastors and church leaders
857871 the bhil people worship ancestral spirits but also celebrate all the hindu festivals their superstitions about evil spirits make them suspicious of change which hinders community development adp staff live among the bhil people they work with gaining the villagers trust and showing their christian love for the people by their actions and commitment
857872 committed to working in partnership with churches and other christian organisations for the purpose of world mission
857873 cabinet meetings start with prayers and where no presidential speech is complete without some statement of christian faith
857874 us officials have continued to engage state officials on the implementation and reversal of anti conversion laws
857875 this act foreigners act strictly prohibits visitors who are in the country on tourist visas from engaging in religious preaching without first obtaining permission from the ministry of home affairs given this context the government discourages foreign missionaries from entering the country and has a policy of expelling foreigners who perform missionary work without the correct visa new missionaries currently enter as tourists on short term visas u s citizens accused of religious preaching while visiting india as tourists have faced difficulties obtaining permission to return to the country for up to a decade after the event
857876 all three designed in part to stem the spread of communism
857877 that june president nixons director of us aid john hannah had admitted publicly that aid had funded cia operations in laos and subsequent revelations pointed to cia aid collaboration in ecuador uruguay thailand and the phillippines
857878 one of the greatest surprises of george w bushs presidency so far has been his call to dramatically increase u s foreign aid in september 2002 bush released his national security strategy which gave prominence to development and aid alongside defense and diplomacy then came his state of the union address in which he called for 10 billion in new funding 15 billion total over the next five years to combat hiv aids in africa and the caribbean

857880 i depicted their lifestyle trade commerce attitude and above all their worship of nature through my paintings
857881 those people believed in continuity in life after death they worshipped the five elements and practised the adage fire as the seed and water as the nourisher for change procreation and tranformation
857882 these 650 odd rock caves dating back to some 12 000 years or beyond are a visual delight with their wall paintings which represent the seven ages of human civilizatio right from the paleolithic and neolithic eras
857883 in the paper i stressed the need for acknowledging these caves as one of indias several heritage sites i even sent the paper to various publications but nobody printed it
857884 we both have a background in arts so we want to use it for spreading a cultural movement and art awareness weve undertaken research on heritage and are trying to project it through art
857885 shes been doing that over the last two decades but a rangoli doesnt remain forever and gets wiped out easily i wanted to preserve the transient beauty of this art form hence rangoli paintings
857886 it is a divine concept that comes from the worship of mandalas or intricate designs ancient civilizations knew that lines and dots represent energy centers and offer protection against any evil
857887 they depict the very genesis of our existence and are very easy to understand
857888 weve lost the lost the art of appreciating art and creativity people need to be made aware of their artistic heritage and the kind of liberalism it has propagated through the centuries
857889 in fact i want to do an art project which im going to call
857890 look if you want to wait downstairs then maybe you should but ive really got to meet him

857910 we are suffering our loss this is obviously a most difficult time for us
857911 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
857912 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately
857913 when you looked at his reaction when it happened there were natural moments that you cannot premeditate
857914 after the push armour took two or three steps because he still had his mind on the play then he turned around and went to the official to see if he was okay the natural reaction under stress is the truth so i have little doubt it was an incident of being blocked into the official
857915 we shouldnt accept it when our neighbors try deciding what choices we shouldnt be permitted if you dont like fried chicken dont eat it if you think your neighbors shouldnt like it either try persuasion past that mind your own business
857916 sharon adams understands the economic rationale for filling a vacant building with a restaurant but if we dont change the over concentration of fast food its going to be very difficult to bring in traditional businesses that better serve the neighborhood she said

857918 all things work for good for those who love the lord and who are called according to his purpose
857919 for those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters
857920 make something really special out of angela use everything that happens in her life to make her look and act like christ dont overwhelm her but work on it
857921 and those he predestined he also called and those he called he also justified and those he justified he also glorified

857947 the extent to which they collect information about consumers use of their broadband services or web sites
857948 has your company at any time tailored or facilitated the tailoring of internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
857949 new technologies such as deep packet inspection technologies have the ability to track every single web site a consumer visits while surfing the web
857950 this sweeping ability to collect analyze and profile how individuals use their broadband connection raises clear privacy issues and i believe such activity should occur only with the express prior consent of individual citizens
857951 obviously employers dont go overseas to recruit somebody for low skilled jobs
857952 these tend to be professional and trade type of jobs
857953 the numbers arent large in the overall scheme of things but theyre important positions that employers cant seem to fill by going to other provinces
857954 we hadnt really done a whole lot of international recruitment before
857955 so this is not only an opportunity for us to recruit good people but to go on a fact finding mission and see what we want to do and how exactly we want to do it
857956 india is probably one of the best educated workforces on the continent in terms of engineers and operators for our plants
857957 those countries beyond canada certainly provide a good labour pool
857958 it is a global workforce and quite honestly canada is the last to leave the gate australia and new zealand have been in india recruiting very strongly
857959 a term applied to the thought of 17 th and 18 th century freethinkers who sought to maintain a belief in god while making it compatible with the rationalism of the enlightenment
857960 i think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous which i hope is the case with me

858017 bedanya dalam hal sedikit saja kalau yang disampaikan knkt tidak ada teriakan allahu akbar tapi secara garis besar materi percakapannya sama
858018 sulit menerima jika dikatakan bahwa rekaman pembicaraan yang beredar luas di internet itu sebagai tidak asli
858019 dengan teknologi digital proses perpindahan data dimungkinkan dengan mudah dan cepat sehingga sulit mengatakan bahwa data rekaman pembicaraan asli tidak tersebar bocor ke mana mana
858020 jika benar rekaman tersebut bocor wajib diusut siapa yang membocorkan dan apa motivasinya selain tindakan kriminal pidana juga sangat mencoreng kredibilitas ri yang sedang berjuang mencabut larangan terbang uni eropa ue
858021 tapi menurut saya knkt tidak menyembunyikan apa pun karena memang percakapan di rekaman itu juga sama seperti yang disampaikan knkt meski kurang lengkap
858022 dating sucks what to do when your love life makes you miserable
858023 he still loves me were just at different places in our lives
858024 it was a lot easier to get the conversations going because everyone had a story of how they know each other
858025 the landscape scale ecology of pollinators and pollination mechanisms patterns and processes
858026 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
858027 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
858028 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
858029 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
858030 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
858031 is it love when you wont accept the appearance of them what they believe their sexuality
858032 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
858033 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
858034 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
858035 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
858036 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
858037 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
858038 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
858039 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
858040 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
858041 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
858042 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
858043 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
858044 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
858045 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
858046 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
858047 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
858048 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
858049 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
858050 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
858051 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
858052 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
858053 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
858054 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
858055 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
858056 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
858057 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
858058 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
858059 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
858060 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
858061 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
858062 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
858063 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
858064 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
858065 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
858066 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
858067 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
858068 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
858069 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
858070 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
858071 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
858072 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
858073 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
858074 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
858075 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
858076 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
858077 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
858078 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
858079 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off

858193 it was a real challenge to figure out how to get meredith to the place where she was healthy enough to make this step with derek

858195 youre going to see a lot of really interesting sparks between the two of them

858199 jake is telling everyone they are getting married at christmas
858200 he told me he had proposed several times but she kept telling him she wanted to give their relationship more time
858201 when he asked her again a couple of weeks ago she finally said yes
858202 it wouldnt hurt if when a woman came home a guy ran up to her with his tail wagging and he showered her with kisses
858203 that kind of genuine excitement to see someone is something id like to see in a man to be honest
858204 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer
858205 without going into all the details the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like there was something more going on and were very affectionate with each other

858216 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
858217 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements

858219 we try to give the players what we think is a hard golf course but fair and today theres no question we had a couple of hard hole locations but they were well within our tolerances

858232 the chinese olympic committee has never made predictions about the medals
858233 team usa will be hard pressed to maintain its supremacy at the 2008 olympic games in beijing
858234 in terms of its gold medal progression since 1996 16 in 1996 28 in 2000 and 32 in 2004 china is clearly poised to overtake team usa in 2008
858235 you do usually get one pin that everyone wants and it has nothing to do with the cost of the pin but something that catches peoples eye
858236 these new countries might not be aware of the extent of pin collecting and only give their athletes a few pins if that is the case everyone will be after them
858237 people get carried away in the olympics and they want their collections to be special but the collections often end up being worth way way less than they paid
858238 its not a hobby to make money have fun and meet people
858239 like anything there are people that try to take advantage and you really need to be careful
858240 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
858241 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
858242 senator obamas campaign staff has clearly concluded the current no drilling no bill strategy is unsustainable and damaging to the senators election prospects in november
858243 so the senator has indicated he is open to a compromise even if this angers the hard core environmental vote
858244 well i think whats going on here is that barack obama is not afraid of working in a bipartisan way to find a real solution
858245 he has not changed what hes prepared to do is break americas gridlock by honouring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
858246 first barack obamas political team is savvy enough to know the same guy who pumps his gas on monday votes on tuesday and energy policy is really an economic issue not a social value because happy polar bears dont pay the rent
858247 second the terms obama has offered windfall taxes for more energy virtually guarantee inaction given narrow political divisions and a bush veto so this seems a lot more like a free point than an actual about face
858248 were out of session were out of business on energy when we should be in session doing the american peoples business

858255 the essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held but in how they are held instead of being held dogmatically they are held tentatively and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment

858257 you get some of your most enthusiast customers who would be more than willing to pay more money to tivo but they no longer have to and what weve basically done is for the cost of lifetime substituted that with a three year deal

858261 i bought this for my garage shop and thought it would never get used for much more than sawdust or general dirt then my water heater flooded my basement while i was away i was able to get the water shut off and replace the water heater but i wasnt sure if the vac would be able to help get the basement emptied out i was concerned that it would not be able to handle that amount of water and even if it could that it would take way too long it not handled the water it went right through it i was done clearing water as deep as 3 inches in some areas within an hour i must have filled it at least four times and used the built in drain to empty its contents into my sump where it was pumped out i used standard squeegee after getting the majority of the water out to get the floors as dry as possible it went from being just another vacuum to being an essential tool in a pinch for the price you just cannot beat that performance
858262 about 4 years ago we bought this model shop vac for garage outside use we use it exclusively for anything from simply blowing leaves out of the garage to vaccuming the cars out my father uses it to blow the water off his 05 harley after a wash 2 years ago we bought a split level home and it needed some tlc we completely gutted the place down to the concrete slab and remodeled it the vaccum saw alot of heavy and grungy use and it never missed a beat this vaccum overall has been an excellent tool it has never let us down and has been very cost effective i dont know how we lived without one in the first place if anyone plans on doing some remodeling or simply using it as a small clean up tool i highly reccommend this vaccum in all respects

858277 you kind of have an idea of what he has by watching video and i was just trying to hit a ball i could drive
858278 it was a fastball thats what i think it was
858279 about the only pitch i had to go with was my cutter and i didnt really figure that out until i had already given up the runs

858311 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory then his children are old enough to recognize the consequences
858312 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
858313 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
858314 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking
858315 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
858316 i question a lot about whether these people really care as much about the cause as they do about bringing notoriety to themselves

858319 man i think the key to me is this i have been counting down the days to get back on that field once the initial shock of my injury wore off
858320 i just want to help my team win nothing more or less i am so hungry just to get back after it i feel like i want to go outside in the parking lot and play right now and these two guys sitting here with me mccoy and mckillop deserve all the attention they are going to get they are both superstars and both great teammates who work hard
858321 i dont see the sense in saying i was happy to be injured
858322 but we have a lot of great young players and a lot of experienced talented players and i think this year could be special we could win a lot of games we could get to a bowl game and who knows we could maybe even win the big east so there are a lot of things to look forward to
858323 like i said i want to look forward i am optimistic about the future you cant forget what happened but you have to let it go and i have i have made peace with it all and just want to go out there and get started with practice
858324 if there is anyone we dont have to worry about being mature enough to handle the adversity and coming back it is derek he is one of our leaders one of our stars and frankly the only thing that has changed about his role is that it is this year instead of last

858401 there is no greater challenge in the world of television than to televise the olympics
858402 youve got to be at the top of your game
858403 because this is the olympics and because there may be an australian involved all of a sudden you see a story being told and youre riveted
858404 the beauty of this arrangement is that were able to stay with those events
858405 if a volleyball game goes for two hours we dont break away to go somewhere else seven is the primary broadcaster which means they have first call and in some cases they may go to an event that we are already covering
858406 we are the complementary broadcaster and thats a terrific arrangement everybody wins especially the viewers as we have two free to air channels with wall to wall olympics
858407 sure it would be nice to sit in front of some pagoda in beijing
858408 but were just concentrating on the events and providing links and throws seven are an excellent broadcaster of sport and the olympics and were very happy they came to us were not competitors this is all done in the olympic spirit
858409 the games dont require 16 minutes of ads per hour
858410 this is the first time the pictures will be in high definition
858411 when it comes to the actual innovations theyre quite varied depending on the specific sport and i think its part of the surprise of watching
858412 there is actually nothing that a viewer will miss theyll go all day every day
858413 weve had a lot of calls from viewers saying im going to take holidays what time do i need to start watching
858414 i havent ordered my playoff tickets yet the question is now why bother who wants to pay 10 and endure mid august weather to see this team get the snot kicked out of them the only reason to go to the ballpark this half has been to see the other team the other team and it doesnt matter who it is has more talent plays better defense smacks the ball around and generally gets to fatten their stats chalk up an easy win and laugh at the bad news travs
858415 hey i should really introduce the greenpeace uk web team to the amnesty web team theyre both going to be using to be opportunities for knowledge sharing maybe even co development
858416 freedom of choice is not itself the perfection of liberty but it helps us take our first step toward freedom or slavery spontaneity or compulsion the free man is the one whose choices have given him the power to stand on his own feet and determine his own life according to the higher light and spirit that are in him the slave in the spiritual order is the man whose choices have destroyed all spontaneity in him and have delivered him over bound hand and foot to his own compulsions idiosyncrasies and illusions so that he never does what he really wants to do but only what he has to do
858417 in times of personal crisis our attention is caught up in private inner turmoil and in the urgency to find a resolution to the confusion or and escape from it
858418 one of the prime injunctions in the spirituality of the desert fathers is
858419 sheriff litchfield was just a man of great ability and character he would have been a success in anything he chose to do
858420 i think baton rouge was just very fortunate that his chosen field was law enforcement we certainly are a better city and have a more professional sheriffs office because of his service
858421 its just a time for me to reflect on elmer litchfield the man
858422 i think the sheriff epitomized what public service is all about
858423 he embodied all the qualities every law enforcement officer should possess honesty integrity professionalism an unflinching sense of right and wrong and a genuine concern and compassion for helping people
858424 he may have left us but the legacy of his service will long live on
858425 if you want the media there when you need them well then you have to be there when they need you
858426 you may not always say what they want you to say but you must say something
858427 not only did we lose an outstanding sheriff we lost a legend
858428 his legacy speaks for itself as sheriff but we lost a good friend
858429 i used to ask him sometimes how he would say jokes and not crack a smile it was just his way
858430 those are not the type you see grinning and giving a lot in the media and things of that nature
858431 deep down the compassion was there i can surely tell you that
858432 elmer will probably be remembered for transforming east baton rouge parish office from the dark ages to the 21 st century
858433 i look at him as a father a leader and a very good friend a christian individual who loved people and loved his community
858434 at this stage hell play the season out unless he believes he cant contribute
858435 its going to mean that at times our young defenders are going to take up some big jobs to help him out
858436 he is still our best defender and he is very keen as the leader to support the team through a tough year and hes fit enough to do it at the moment
858437 hes obviously carrying an injury and been sore but i think thats the courageous defender that he is
858438 hes probably been under pressure more so this year than ever before with the amount of inside 50s the opposition sides have been having because we havent been winning games of footy
858439 the defence has been under more pressure than ever so i think those two things combined have probably put darren under a lot of pressure and its probably showing his injury to be worse than it probably is
858440 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year
858441 will change the way you think about digital photos forever
858442 tens of thousands of shots enjoying the freedom of not paying and waiting for film processing of life and stuff in and around victoria bc about as far west on the west coast of canada as you can get without falling into the pacific
858443 accuracy is among our most sacred journalistic values that goes for the photographs as well as the words that we publish so it is with much regret that i inform you that the color in a photograph in thursdays editions was inappropriately altered before it was published the photo taken by observer photographer patrick schneider appeared on the front of the local amp state section it depicted a charlotte firefighter on a ladder silhouetted by the light of the early morning sun
858444 if you can find a path with no obstacles it probably doesnt lead anywhere

858464 one of the reasons for the poor intake of girls in the flagship btech programme is that parents dont send daughters for coaching classes the best way to increase the intake of girls is to have direct admissions
858465 they students think there is nothing wrong in missing school to attend coaching but the student does not realize his real loss
858466 ranking is an issue only because of the current fetish with a pecking order which is used for allocating seats

858729 i am all in favour of having more options we have too few treatment options i certainly recognise that
858730 but a minority of people with drug and alcohol problems see clinicians only eight per cent of people with drug and alcohol problem will go anywhere near a clinician in the next 12 months
858731 i dont want to downplay the significance of these people i would not have a job if not for them but i also want to make sure there are answers for the 92 per cent of people who never come to a clinician
858732 the americans just dont get it frankly drug addiction is a brain disease to these people
858733 they have the worst drug problem in the world and they go around telling the rest of the world particularly poor countries how they should run their drug programs
858734 whats not mentioned is that a lot of the people using and selling cocaine live impoverished lives they are often from minority populations and they use drugs like cocaine to make their miserable lives less miserable

858736 the emperor had a lovely set of clothes for about three months
858737 he said he would think about it but wanted to do it bloodlessly its looking like that will happen now
858738 i think it will regenerate the party we had no show with mr buswell as leader its still going to be very difficult but we will have a fighting chance
858739 ive enjoyed it and ill continue to work on the issues until the day i leave but im leaving
858740 people are switching off politics which i think is a very unfortunate situation it certainly makes it tough for troy to compete against alan carpenter
858741 its clearly a move for the moment rather than a move of where the partys going to be or will be in the future
858742 its a surprise in the sense that he seemed to be hanging on and it looked as though thats what he was going to do and also that the alternative is so unusual and fraught
858743 i mean you are going to bring back someone who said they are going to retire and in the process youre going to upset the endorsement of one of your star new recruits which is presumably what they are going to have to do
858744 its also very much a papering over the cracks move because presumably in the long term theyve got to find someone else
858745 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders

858760 we are very excited about bringing neals yard remedies to the middle east
858761 the region is going though a very exciting retail growth phase and the organic remedies and herbs fit well with our culture
858762 chapter 33 when youve got a guy dazed knock him out
858763 im not holding any wheres daddy demons i never step into the cage angry trying to turn my opponent into my long lost father
858764 you always have to get the fuck back up in fact this is how i know im not done the only thing i wanted to do as soon as the cobwebs cleared after rampage was start fighting again same with jardine because i still love to fight who knew that this would become one of the most popular sports in the world no one knew least of all me but sometimes you get lucky
858765 its good to see that there is an initiative to create jobs in the private sector i think that thats brilliant and i think that andrew forest from the fortescue metals group should be congratulated on that
858766 however its an overly ambitious program its based upon falsehood so its like the prime minister wants to push a restart button and pretend that the government has not since 1967 so for 41 years now worked on policies and programs to implement job opportunities for aboriginal torres strait islander people around australia
858767 theres been probably a billion or more dollars spent over those 40 years in training programs and job outcomes so its very ambitious and i think its irresponsible of the prime minister to announce a scheme like this without presenting much more specifics
858768 behind that the reasons for the failures in the programs in the past and this program i would forecast will fail dramatically simply because the government just wants to make the same mistakes all over again
858769 as i understand it at its highest point the cdep community development employment projects employed about 35 000 people around australia and i think at the same time there was less than 30 000 people employed in the public service and i think less than 20 000 people employed in the private sector
858770 to talk about creating all of a sudden 50 000 additional jobs for aboriginal people is far beyond the figures that are available
858771 now im not sure of the accuracy of the figures that are around at the moment but thats simply because the government over a decade ago discontinued to provide any information about the levels of aboriginal employment and training
858772 what we found is that the jobs are still not there and they never have been there and theyve never been made available through training programs that the governments offered
858773 its got to be also a positive initiative taken on by the aboriginal community that if it does involve people having to make adjustments to their lives to their communities and their families in order to take up jobs then the communities have to be willing to do it
858774 we saw 30 years ago nsw trying to move people from western areas of the state into newcastle to get jobs in the mining industries there that failed dramatically
858775 weve seen queensland also trying to move people around to get jobs that failed dramatically also
858776 so it has to be a co operative approach between aboriginal people and government to get an outcome and the private sector has to commit itself in fact i think that it will never succeed in australia unless there is affirmative action legislation put in place
858777 but i think its the private sector the public sector has shown that it can actually employ aboriginal torres strait islander people theres been a recent decline but up until the howard administration the levels of aboriginal people employed in the public sector were greater than the percentages in the community
858778 i think it was more than 1 5 per cent 2 per cent of people were employed in the public sector and the targets had been met
858779 in the private sector in fact the figures went backwards not forwards on the whole thing and of course there were also many jobs in the community sector when community controlled organisations were delivering services those jobs have disappeared as well
858780 these sort of sensational headlines in one day are not going to help the situation as i said ive been involved personally i mean theres 20 years worth of studies done into employment in 1988
858781 the government launched the aboriginal primate development policy i was a part of that and that had been after many years of policy and research to get those things in place and then they were all abandoned in 1996
858782 now were trying to go straight from cdep to 50 000 jobs its just unrealistic
858783 by scott detrow 7 28 you should read the whole thing but here are a few excerpts
858784 thisll involve those serious breaches not for minor things like forgetting to close the lid on a rubbish bin but for serious breaches of licence conditions
858785 that information will be on the website as well as prosecutions
858786 this adds to the regulations the strength of childcare in nsw
858787 i would hope that in future wed have no one on this list but if people are prosecuted they will be listed on this website
858788 we think that having this information available for parents will enable them to make the best possible decisions when they make that really important decision about who is going to care for my child
858789 rioters drove two vehicles into a station under the border patrol armed police division in the xinjiang city of kashgar
858790 i have already paid for the flights and accommodation and i have managed to get a few tickets to a few events but obviously the tickets that i bought through this website are gone
858791 i had bought opening and closing ceremony tickets swim finals and some football tickets i must say that up until now i was hoping that the tickets would just turn up but i have been complaining to various authorities about this because i sensed it was a scam a few months ago
858792 ill pursue this when i get back i am going to track these guys i have been in touch with some others who have lost money and we estimate these guys have been raking in much more than 50 million
858793 with respect to ticket scamming there has been a reasonable number who have been caught
858794 the aoc has always advised consumers to only buy tickets from the official ticket provider and no one else despite the fact they all claimed offshore websites had plenty of tickets when cosport had none
858795 as you surely know the usoc has been working with the ioc on the us lawsuits involving the fraudulent sales of olympic tickets through www beijingticketing com and other related websites
858796 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics mr buswell told a media conference in perth today
858797 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
858798 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party mr buswell said
858799 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site

858802 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
858803 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
858804 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
858805 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
858806 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
858807 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
858808 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
858809 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
858810 i like this team i think weve got a chance to be good for quite a while
858811 i was trying to figure out the guy because id never faced him before
858812 i was trying to get something out over the plate i put good swings on it i think ive had more hits there right field than i did all last year
858813 when we got to the fifth i thought maybe that would be my last inning
858814 but i didnt throw too many pitches in the sixth he trusted me to go back out there and that was good
858815 its a great time to be part of the rangers organization
858816 i left a couple of pitches over the plate against a good hitting team and they capitalized on those mistakes
858817 ive got to learn to stay within myself and not overthrow
858818 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times

858822 i suppose for both teams it is a bit like playing the nab cup the next four weeks and we are heading into round 1
858823 the win gives us four games clear of fourth currently sydney with four games left and there are a couple of blokes maybe carrying little things so we are able to get games into players that might be able to help us in september as well as to refresh the stocks a bit at least now we can plan for september pretty well
858824 we will need to get games into tim callan callan ward maybe peter street shaun higgins and scott west will hopefully be back about round 20 21 so we will need to get them some senior games come finals time because if we need to use them in the finals they will need some sort of match fitness
858825 we dont want to flirt with our form we want good form going into september we have four tough games
858826 i dont think you want to flirt with your form and think too far ahead
858827 the competitions too good for that i think sides that have shown no respect to lesser sides have been found out so we look forward to the next four weeks trying to settle the side and get our performance right and our match play right
858828 i think when you start looking too far ahead thats when you can get injured if you take it a little bit easier or guys get complacent thats definitely not what you want at this time of the year
858829 if thats how they the western bulldogs want to prepare for it thats up to them but like we have all year we worry about our own preparation and who we come up against in the week coming up to that game
858830 im very grateful for the faith of the selection panel to put me straight back in i was probably lucky with ossie michael osborne not coming up i probably would have had a game at box hill but you take your chances

858852 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
858853 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

858857 even if it is true that commonplace advertising and exhibitions of bad taste are indicative of the mental capacity of the man in the street the opposing argument is equally valid bromidic advertising catering to that bad taste merely perpetuates that mediocrity and denies him one of the most easily accessible means of aesthetic development

858880 if the bills are enacted this form of theft would decrease because it would increase the ability for law enforcement to go after criminals

858898 mental patients are not supposed to be in homes for the aged

858900 hopefully my ministry and the health ministry can come up with a cabinet paper and solve the problems within six months
858901 we have many cases where our officers and other residents were hurt by them when they turned aggressive
858902 old folks homes do not have facilities to treat them

858911 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
858912 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
858913 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
858914 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
858915 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
858916 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
858917 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
858918 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
858919 i definitely wasnt very efficient and didnt have easy innings which made it a tough game
858920 the main thing is we won and we had some big hits and scored some runs early and that made it easy for me
858921 the key to us being successful is we have to pitch and thats the same for most teams
858922 we have pitched awfully well from a starting standpoint and when we had trouble our bullpen has come in and bailed us out
858923 i knew i had to drive the baseball and try to get a double or better
858924 i just picked up a d80 a few months ago which is fine for my needs
858925 just because youve got a big asshole doesnt mean you havent got a baseball bat stuck up your arse
858926 you know you are going all the way to the top right
858927 the nikon d3 already more than matches the canon 5d what why would they release one to match the 5d
858928 well if the d3 is better than lower level cameras then why produce consumer cameras
858929 dad you make the best turkey burgers i love them
858930 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
858931 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
858932 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
858933 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
858934 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
858935 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
858936 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
858937 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
858938 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
858939 some of our top clients here in london are actually american
858940 since the turnaround of the business over the last few seasons weve had huge amounts of interest from the american customer
858941 i think there is a huge desire from the american consumer for us so its a very good time for us to be going in
858942 we want to develop the vintage collection with bergdorf and to work with saks on the london line and bloomingdales with mens
858943 we are also in discussion with jeffrey so there will be selected beautiful independents that we will also engage with but predominantly we want to build relationships with key accounts
858944 i think the combination of having the heritage but also being very new and very exciting is a good combination for the american market
858945 by renown narrowing down and focusing on the top brands its actually a far better result for us particularly as were really deemed the jewel in the crown
858946 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
858947 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
858948 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
858949 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
858950 he just comes out with things i dont even have to ask any questions
858951 he has you log the discussion and it all comes true when you look back at it
858952 he does have a following in fashion just from being near the business for so many years
858953 i help prioritize peoples goals and choices and the cards are really good at that
858954 the tarot helps distinguish between fate and destiny destiny happens no matter what but fate happens with your choices i help understand peoples destiny and help create choices to improve their fate
858955 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
858956 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
858957 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
858958 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
858959 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
858960 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
858961 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
858962 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
858963 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
858964 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
858965 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
858966 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
858967 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
858968 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
858969 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
858970 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
858971 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
858972 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
858973 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
858974 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
858975 retail stands out as one of the sectors being hit hardest by this latest contraction of payrolls
858976 consumers have diminished job prospects dwindling paychecks and higher travel costs to shopping centers which doesnt bode well for the retail sector
858977 we have to show our product specialists that we have the opportunity to develop new customers
858978 hello we have other things the cure will help a lot and we are relaunching our vitamin c products in october with streamlined packaging
858979 this is like taking your skin to the spa to restore balance and prevent aging
858980 we can compete with clarins lanc me and est e lauder in better prices
858981 we know our products are effective but we have to change the mind set of our employees
858982 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
858983 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
858984 their corporate office bought it and theyll probably display it around the country
858985 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
858986 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
858987 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
858988 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
858989 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
858990 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
858991 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
858992 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
858993 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
858994 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
858995 retail shares again took a beating in morning trading friday as the dow jones industrial average sank below 11 000 on continuing concerns about issues ranging from gas prices to second quarter earnings the standard amp poors retail index was down more than 4 percent at midday more than twice the decline suffered by the djia at the same point one day after american retailers filed better than expected sales results for june investors appeared to focus on the grueling difficulties confronting stores in the next few months when they will attempt to persuade consumers to buy without the benefit of federal tax rebates macys inc plummeted more than 10 percent during the morning dropping more than 2 below its previous 52 week low of 16 34 before recovering modestly

859011 you find a lot of rehashed titles the gaming experience is poor and its hard to discover the games
859012 we want to be the definitive publisher of games for the iphone we think there is a tremendous opportunity
859013 you have a ds and you have a telephone why not buy just one
859014 the iphone has excellent hardware in it it is as capable as the ds or psp
859015 the games that you currently have are very appealing but that doesnt last for long
859016 we started buying hybrids in 2002 long before gas prices spiked
859017 obviously having hybrid vehicles is a huge part of that
859018 an unrecognised spiralling epidemic as men as well as women are bombarded with images of the ideal body
859019 the rise in male anorexia actually masked a much bigger problem because men traditionally are less likely to seek help
859020 there has been a rise in focus on the body aesthetic and thats affecting men as well as girls
859021 clinics are seeing many more men as well as children as young as eight we know children are more likely to develop an eating disorder during puberty and puberty is starting on average five years earlier than it did 50 years ago
859022 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
859023 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale writeoffs in both rescap and gmac auto
859024 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end 2008
859025 it is amazing we can see the strained yet still ordered interface structure that opens up a wide pathway for ions to be conducted
859026 the new layered material solves this problem by combining two materials with very different crystal structures the mismatch triggers a distortion of the atomic arrangement at their interface and creates a pathway through which ions can easily travel
859027 rather than forcing the ions to jump from hole to hole the new material has lots of vacant spaces to be occupied so the ions can travel much more quickly
859028 cyberbullying is much worse because you cannot see the bully and its a 24 7 thing you cant get away from it
859029 schools are struggling with this issue because youre dealing with a students private space but they know they cant just ignore cyberbullying
859030 we are seeing school systems address this problem in various educational programs and those will continue to grow in number and in content

859043 we want people to know that the program is not right for everyone
859044 its for people who drive at low risk times of day and who keep alert for others on the road
859045 they dont make fast lane changes or follow too closely behind other drivers so they dont have to overreact or slam on the brakes
859046 the consumer is really being given an opportunity to potentially reduce their auto insurance premium in exchange for giving their auto insurer access to information that currently isnt available to them
859047 we see this as kind of a creeping abduction of peoples data
859048 basically once they collect that data it belongs to the insurance company thats a big problem
859049 a bottom for the american housing market is not visible

859079 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
859080 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
859081 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
859082 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
859083 we started up the first hill and i was dragging like a cement block
859084 as a veteran i would say are you kidding me i would say why would you take such a hard stance i understand you have to think of the future but as a player i would say you know what lets go out and give them an equal opportunity and let the best man win
859085 i understand aaron rodgers its a delicate situation for him but if you let the competition decide who wins no one can be upset about that and brett may not win and if that happens youre in the best of all situations because aaron has proved to you that he can go out there and get it done

859088 its still early in camp we havent even played our first exhibition yet
859089 weve already added to the grid the equivalent of several years production of plug in hybrids
859090 we see the vehicle penetration levels coming at a rate thats manageable
859091 its not like tomorrow the flood gates are going to open and 100 000 vehicles are going to come into san francisco or something like that
859092 were confident that we have enough liquidity to get through
859093 we think the quarter has a negative read across for gm as the shortfall to ford earnings seems to have been largely a function of a weaker economy not cost execution
859094 strong unit sales and further efficiency improvements in all of our divisions led to very good results in a difficult environment
859095 the fact that pilots would volunteer to take a 30 minute survey certainly suggested the pilots had a few things they wanted others to know about
859096 it now appears it would have been very useful to have a different source of information about airline safety
859097 i think that the companies may de emphasize leases by pricing them tougher
859098 always includes a certain amount of leasing to support ford sales
859099 we recognize our goal to maintain and enhance the highest aviation safety record in the world and we look forward to working with congress as the results of our ongoing reviews are concluded
859100 first legislative step in reversing the complacency over safety regulation that has set in at the highest levels of the federal aviation administration
859101 what we were trying to do is eliminate some of the relationships that build up and make certain there was some oversight over those relationships
859102 we dont want to lose the best of the best
859103 this legislation is not a silver bullet that will produce a comprehensive solution to problems that have been developing for years
859104 that is equating to lower sales for gm and causing them to now fall behind toyota
859105 certainly the biggest risk is the u s economic downturn and potential spill over effects on the global economy
859106 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
859107 i believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible
859108 to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint
859109 this is classic johnson admits that myers has violated the umns code of conduct and then proceeds to tell us why he is being allowed to do so with a matter of academic freedom
859110 academic freedom is not the issue academic malpractice is for example section 10 21 b of umns tenure code explicitly says that a tenured faculty member can be terminated or suspended for unprofessional conduct which severely impairs a faculty members fitness in a professional capacity
859111 in 2001 this part of the tenure code was invoked against a professor at umn because he had images of child porn on his computer
859112 it is a sure bet that umn would not tolerate a white professor who worked a comedy club on weekends trashing blacks indeed it would say that such behavior disqualifies his ability to be objective in many respects myers is worse and that is why sanctions are warranted
859113 i pierced it the host with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash
859114 they are just paper nothing must be held sacred his emphasis question everything god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet
859115 the university must now take action and apply the appropriate sanction
859116 it is important for catholics to know that the university of minnesota will not tolerate the deliberate destruction of the eucharist by one of its faculty just as african americans would not tolerate the burning of a cross and jews would not tolerate the display of swastikas catholics will not tolerate the desecration of the eucharist
859117 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
859118 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
859119 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
859120 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
859121 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
859122 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
859123 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
859124 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
859125 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
859126 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
859127 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
859128 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
859129 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
859130 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
859131 i had to wait two years to get back my amateur status
859132 i tried u s amateur qualifying last week and missed it but this feels really good to win this tournament
859133 i just remember it was always a big tournament and it was covered so well that its finally nice to be a part of it
859134 i was never able to play because we lived in davie county so this means a lot to me
859135 i knew i needed to make that last putt to get into the playoff but i just pushed it a little
859136 im not disappointed because i did the best that i could
859137 i was able to make par and that was it
859138 i kind of had a feeling uly was doing well ahead of us
859139 i just did as well as i could and then wound up in the playoff i hit it into three bunkers on 18 and still made bogey so thats pretty good
859140 i knew that richard would have to come back to me a little bit but as it turned out if he would have shot even par he would have won
859141 i just tried to make some birdies to see what would happen
859142 im just more comfortable in these shoes and its what i wear when im just banging the ball around at bermuda run
859143 if i would have won this year i might have gotten the big head and stopped practicing or whatever so this kind of puts me back in my place ill be back
859144 when i went down the schedule with the team and i brought up marshall there was a groan in the room
859145 weve had lofty goals since the first year and weve been right there theyre probably a little more attainable now
859146 last year we had a lot of players who just wanted to get out on the field and play
859147 this year they want to do what it takes to win i hope this year that can be one of our strengths
859148 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
859149 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
859150 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
859151 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
859152 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion nine nine percent of the time it works out for us
859153 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
859154 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
859155 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
859156 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
859157 i know he wasnt feeling good but this was unexpected
859158 if i go tonight ive had a hell of a life
859159 im going to be really interested in seeing where our team is
859160 we need to be better than we were in all of our skills when we finished spring practice
859161 i would suspect that about halfway through or three quarters into the practice ill get a little feel in my gut one way or the other to be anxious and excited or to realize just how much work we still have to do
859162 people have talked about that a great deal obviously we want to come out of the chute playing well hopefully winning but the biggest thing is playing well were not going to put all our eggs in one basket in that regard
859163 being able to finish better whether its the fourth quarter or the end of the season is going to define this team i think the critical part of all our work is how well we finish in november
859164 im not going to sweat every little small thing that happens to us
859165 were going to enjoy this im going to absolutely make sure our team understands hard work but that they have fun playing football i think if youre not careful as a coach you can take the fun out of this game
859166 i have a strong enough personality that i can make people miserable if im not real careful my mother tells me that and i realize that outside of that i really wouldnt do anything differently than ive done before i love to be at work and i love to get to know the players
859167 i am absolutely going to make sure the folks around us have a good time
859168 ill be 50 in january and ive been working for omnia and them at modern toyota and ive got their blessing
859169 eric has got as good a chance as anybody and hes a really good player
859170 but if it doesnt work the worst that can happen is i go back to work at modern toyota so its not a pressure type of thing
859171 im confident he can do it so i dont think well ever have to cross that bridge
859172 when i was talking to walter he said that he noticed at last years q school if you can shoot around even par you can get in
859173 and if you can get into the top 5 you are exempt until they do a reshuffle
859174 im anticipating making it this year so i dont know the answer to that question
859175 john is always a crowd favorite when he plays our tournament
859176 we welcome him back and wish him the best of luck
859177 if he didnt shoot one or two crewmen now and then theyd forget who he was
859178 come let us make a hell of our own and try how long we can bear it
859179 damn ye ye yellow bellied sapsuckers im a better man than all ye milksops put together
859180 what we bear with staked spaced out is a compete so as to goal the resort to arms beside moiety all off funding

859222 moving to a big foreign club it is still too early even if it pleases me
859223 i am pragmatic i wont coach for 20 years but i want to achieve things at the highest level
859224 this is a really magnificent achievement and bodes well for the future of our club

859234 we didnt feel it too much inside i mean pretty much everybody just got shook up
859235 the teens were screaming to let them in because someone was trying to kill them
859236 i think its all down to ourselves and our mentality and how hard were prepared to work
859237 weve got an abundance of ability but weve had that over the last couple of years we just need that something extra that weve been looking for and hopefully well find it this year
859238 every player wants to play in the champions league and i remember being sat here a couple of years ago saying lets go for the champions league wed just bought three or four players but you have to be realistic its not easy
859239 i dont think the morale aspect has got anything to do with it it was a friendly game and i dont think the morale will be a problem
859240 the problem is getting back to a level of play that will allow us to compete in a better manner
859241 we have to get up and playing there is no running away from that and we have to do it very quickly
859242 it was evident in the first half hour of the game on wednesday that we werent up there weve got a bit to do to pick up on and we have to do it quickly
859243 its been like that for years and there is no point complaining about it we have managed to compete in a better manner beforehand so its no excuse
859244 we know that situation is there and we have handled it better in previous matches even in pre season games last year
859245 its just a fact we have to face that we are not reaching the same level as we did do even in the early part of last season
859246 we didnt take a lot from the game apart from the fact that we were well beaten
859247 there were no excuses from our own point of view the first part of the game was the best part for us the second half we were poor
859248 overall liverpool were better and ive got no complaints about the result they could have scored more actually
859249 there was a balance to be achieved there in the sense of bringing an edge to our game for the champions league game
859250 it was important for anelka but more important for us to have more confidence for this player
859251 hes one of the players that we need this season today not because he scored four goals but he played with more quality and freedom than in the other games
859252 its fantastic for his confidence to score four times against milan he believes more and the other players believe in him more
859253 as soon as he came here you could see why he was so successful at his other clubs the lads have taken to his regimes and its starting to pay off for us
859254 theres a lot of strikers and someone has to grab the initiative and show what they can do
859255 it is always nice find the back of the net but obviously the real work starts at middlesbrough in a couple of weeks
859256 it has been a good pre season and if im called on for the first game of the season ill be ready
859257 we keep saying to him dont spend all the goals in pre season keep a few for the season
859258 but it is good strikers need to score goals he didnt play a lot last year but he is playing week in week out now
859259 now im back at united the plan is to force my way into the first team plans im going to keep working hard and try to do enough to stay
859260 its brilliant to work alongside the great players we have here such as wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs and paul scholes being a part of that can only make me a better player
859261 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16

859279 anonymous said not pro government or something just to clarify government did increase the rates of the financial assistance schemes due to the gst offset package
859280 so will the govt be subsidizing kidneys for the poor who cant afford it
859281 we should not reject any idea just because it is radical or controversial
859282 we may be able to find an acceptable way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living unrelated kidney donors without breaching ethical principles or hurting the sensitivities of others
859283 there are desperate patients out there wishing to live and desperately poor people willing to exchange a kidney for a hopefully improved life
859284 criminalising organ trading does not eliminate it it merely breeds a black market
859285 the suitability of the organ depends on its condition rather than the age of the donor
859286 once a quitter from china india wherever always a quitter
859287 human rights has become a religion that breeds devotees who border on the fanatic it would be hypocrisy for such people to decide what is acceptable for the rest of society
859288 is your life better after 5 years of pap rule
859289 in your walkabouts check on the estate maintenance if mr low has done a good job give him credit for it if there are deficiencies point them out to the residents in short play the role of an effective opposition in hougang
859290 eventually i believe we will win hougang back but whether we do or not i think we should serve the people thats what we are here for
859291 ideally our political system should facilitate the emergence of a strong effective government after every election and a responsible constructive opposition
859292 but no matter how you design it there is no guarantee because it depends on whether good honest and competent people come forward to stand for elections and the wisdom of the electorate when they cast their ballot
859293 so theres a natural tendency which i can appreciate of some people wanting to have a voice not belonging to the party not belonging to the pap to check and balance the pap thats understandable because people want to debate issues they want to have their views expressed in parliament
859294 in india the worlds largest democracy several criminals have been elected into parliament and some are serving jail terms including one convicted murderer who is waiting for his appeal to be heard
859295 but recently they were brought out to vote because a confidence motion on the government was hanging in the balance they were of course then returned to jail but can you imagine
859296 human rights groups are simply like religious evangelists they believe they are helping to bring a good thing to a country that does not have it
859297 if human rights is a religion it isnt paps religion
859298 ya ya who needs all these things when you have the pap to tell you what to do
859299 fickle voters who vote opposition will undo everything we build in five years
859300 the island state has become a rich oasis with pockets of rising poverty where the homeless sleep at void decks or beaches workers in their 60s or 70s clean toilets and sweep floors instead of enjoying their retirement with grandchildren as is befitting the worlds seventh richest nation in per capita gdp
859301 unbridled capitalism winner takes all like in america does not work unless you can cope with an underclass
859302 the human being is an unequal creature this is a fact we started with a great propositions all the great political movements all the great religions all the great political ideologies say let us make the human being as equal as possible in fact he isnt never will be
859303 we are in a strong fiscal position and if any country in the world can afford to find a better solution to deal with this growing income divide it is singapore
859304 the problem is that no body in government is listening
859305 the model for this is singapore where repression is highly selective it is confined to those who make a conscious decision to openly challenge the authorities if you do not you enjoy freedom to travel to live more or less as you wish and perhaps most importantly to make money
859306 in any battle between politics and economics it is the latter that will win out
859307 it was oswald spengler who at the last turn of the last century predicted that the masses will accept with resignation the victory of the caesars the strong men and will obey them
859308 a modern form of authoritarianism quite distinct from soviet communism maoism or fascism is being born it is providing a modicum of a good life and a quiet life the ultimate anesthetic for the brain
859309 reputation moral authority and leadership standing have been gravely injured both local and internationally
859310 i would like to understand how will the gst hike benefit singaporeans
859311 nobody in singapore has been persecuted for saying the truth nobody is going to be persecuted for saying what he believes in and standing up for it
859312 and to conclude on dr chees submissions he says that he doesnt wish mr lee kuan yew and mr lee hsien loong ill in that same breath he says he stands by the new democrat article which alleged that they are criminals corrupt and covered up matters in the nkf and under his breath hes now just said murderers and robbers
859313 and rapists too you might as well throw it in you know right child molesters
859314 and this is the man who says i dont wish them ill
859315 nobody in singapore has been persecuted for saying the truth
859316 nobody is going to be persecuted for saying what he believes in and standing up for it
859317 since its inception pap has been in this business of destroying opponents
859318 in other words you need to be submissive to the coital postion of the dominant male on top of you
859319 for me i had a privileged life in that society but i dont yearn for it anymore there is one core value which is missing there which i think is freedom
859320 as each blind patient regain their sight we were amazed to see them direct their gratefulness to their great leader despite their hardship
859321 i think all bets are off because in five years they opposition can ruin this place
859322 when you are singapore and your existence depends on performance extraordinary performance better than your competitors but that performance disappears because the system on which it is based is eroded then youve lost everything
859323 fixated on wholly meaningless govt data that managed to report the lowest inflation however the govts ability to make economic growth magically appear is based purely on statistical finesse
859324 govt should adjust nominal gdp gains using the gdp deflator which represents the inflation rate this is done to strip inflation out of the gdp calculation so that only real growth gets counted not nominal gains that result purely from inflation
859325 similar illusions are created in other numbers such as retail sales corporate earnings and stock prices which are all rising merely as a result of actual inflation being higher than the official reports for example higher retail sales reflect consumers paying higher prices for the products that they buy they may in fact be buying less stuff but are paying more for it
859326 similarly just as inflation causes prices to rise for goods and services it causes stock prices to rise as well though such gains may be less than the actual increase in the cost of living as long as the govt gets away with using bogus cpi numbers which fail to fully reflect inflation takes credit for nominal gains as if they were real
859327 however as ridiculous as the phony gdp number was yesterdays biggest joke was a report on global competitiveness put out by the world economic forum in davos switzerland which ranked the lie ky lhl pap economy as among the worlds most competitive
859328 numbers dont lie do they ha numbers are the biggest liars on the planet
859329 increasing prices in just about everything has overshadowed the city states prosperity in the last four years
859330 the city state has been hit by an unceasing bout of price increases that has overshadowed the citys prosperity in the past four years inflation is at its worst here in 12 years now 26 years and has become the peoples biggest worry today for many the high costs are blurring the singapore dream
859331 worst affected is the broad middle class a punishing from 5 to 7 rise in the goods and services tax gst
859332 there are two immediate effects the value of money is dropping by the week and savings are discouraged since consumer prices are rising faster than interest the banks pay on deposits
859333 the govt appears unable to take action to stop the epidemic a contrast to the first generation govt during such crises
859334 but so strong and persistent is inflation that many singaporeans feel they are the poorer for it
859335 the govt priorities are economic growth and asset accumulation for foreign investments even at the expense of a higher cost of living to that end it has increased gst from 5 to 7 and may eventually reach 10 fees for public services are being raised to ensure no drop in treasury collection
859336 deficit budget although not entirely unknown in singapore is a very rare happening
859337 many young professionals who just start off in life are worried that the sharp run up in property prices has made it virtually impossible for them to buy a flat some are putting off marriage or raising children
859338 understandably inflation has become a hot debate subject this is tough for the middle class and working class which are just struggling for a living amidst the perceived wealth unhappy and with few choices in life
859339 a straits times check on a random basket of basic goods sold at supermarkets here revealed price increases in almost every category from fresh chicken to coffee and milk formula
859340 rising food prices have contributed to inflation here septembers 2007 overall consumer price index showed that prices generally retreated by 0 3 per cent from the previous month but the food component the biggest item at 23 rose 3 7 as the cost of fresh vegetables fruit seafood and milk powder as well as hawker and restaurant food went up
859341 consumers the straits times spoke to said that while increases for each item may seem like a token sum together they add up to a much bigger grocery bill
859342 she said that rental on her stall which is now s 4 500 a month is set to rise to s 5 500 at the start of next year and then to s 6 500 in 2009
859343 if you dont understand that welcome to the confusing world of national income accounting where up sometimes is down and where sometimes one plus one can equal zero
859344 because of the way govt counts and reports the numbers real life inflation was understated and growth was therefore overstated
859345 the economy didnt really grow 3 9 and inflation really wasnt 0 8 the numbers arent as good as they look
859346 it did produce quirky numbers that dont accurately reflect reality even though they are correct from an accounting point of view the accounting is right but its not reality
859347 the higher the gross domestic product gdp the bigger the bonus even some ruling party mps question the wisdom of such a link
859348 if mondays parliamentary debate on pay revisions for ministers and civil servants focused mainly on that
859349 this bonus is a component which ministers parliamentary secretaries top civil servants and mps are eligible for several of the 13 backbenchers who spoke yesterday had reservations about the gdp bonus one common refrain heard in the house was whether it is a fair performance peg to use
859350 we all know that a rise in gdp may not benefit all sectors of society equally some may even lag behind i would suggest that the govt consider using indicators that directly impact the livelihood of all singaporeans
859351 he proposed one other indicator to be considered that of the total cost of running the govt as a percentage of total revenue after all ceos in the private sector have to ensure profits are not eroded by increasing inflation costs and expenses mr loo said
859352 other suggestions of alternative benchmarks included the consumer price index and the inflation rate as a way to keep cost of living affordable and protect savings citizens feedback to major public services the number of jobs created for singaporeans and even the number of singaporeans who migrate
859353 based on the latest revisions ministers will enjoy a gdp bonus of between 3 and 8 months if the economy grows between 5 and 10 or more but they will not get any bonus if the economy grows by 2 or less for example the entry level annual salary of a minister this year is expected to include a 5 9 month bonus based on singapores estimated gdp growth of between 4 5 and 6 5
859354 another comparison between the civil service pay increases and the s 30 monthly increase for those on public assistance was raised in the house
859355 if we are going to be so generous to civil servants then lets be generous to the very poor
859356 the needs of these individuals are quite different and we need to find more holistic and flexible ways of looking after their needs
859357 one new issue that cropped up yesterday was the danger of concentrating too much power and money in the hands of top public officers
859358 as responsible leaders we must be careful not to leave behind a system or structure that combines power and monetary rewards to such high levels that incumbents are so handcuffed by this lethal combination that they find it hard to let go
859359 on this issue mr teo said that the checks are elections rh a lie since elections are routinely rigged and the ruling partys selection process
859360 if a persons motivations are self serving or to make money we do not select him and if we discover thats what hes about after he has come in we drop him
859361 but economists say one crucial aspect to watch out for is rising inflation it hit 2 9 in august the biggest monthly rise since 1994 mas expects inflation of 1 5 to 2 this year and up to 3 5 for the first half of 2008 but it expects this to ease in the second half of the year with inflation at 2 to 3 for the whole of 2008
859362 we are doing this for the good of the people for the good of the nation
859363 temasek is neither a statutory board nor a government agency we are an investment holding company incorporated under the singapore companies act and we operate strictly as a commercial entity
859364 i believe pap has already set down the legal framework for temasek and gic to be set apart from the government of the day even though they are still run by politicians and their associates therefore if an opposition formed government comes to pass the legal framework will remain
859365 if he sees that his empire is in trouble he will get up from his grave bla bla bla
859366 why there is a shortage because production has been falling
859367 it take a clinton to clean up after a bush
859368 in order to make sure that we protect the integrity of the judiciary and peoples confidence in
859369 law minister shanmugam singaporeans are lucky to be living in a country where there are laws to protect the reputation of their leaders and top civil servants
859370 here is a group of californians demanding electoral reform because they believe the system is unfair in singapore our system cannot be questioned because we got it right under the pap govt
859371 if i go to america and taunt the govt to arrest me while i bad mouth their president i think theyd snap me up in an instant too
859372 i think its satire is an insult to one of the most proficient and corrupt free government in the world by implication it clearly throws doubt on the practises of governance in this country which contrary to its claim is untrue
859373 i have filed a police report asking them to look into identifying the author s of this blog and i hope he or she will duly be charged
859374 but while new post be added to this blog and written in the same tone of subversion it will only add to further incrimination and i suggest a cease and desist to its activity
859375 i have filed a police report asking them to look into identifying the author s of this blog and i hope he or she will duly be charged
859376 he was not being charged based on what he wrote in his blog even though according to his lawyer the alleged insults
859377 except demonstrating that in singapore old people have the dignity of employment the question is irrelevant
859378 dignity of employment when youre in your seventies and youre bent over when you have to work because the govt does not take care of you dignity you give a whole new meaning to the word dignity mr singh perhaps you can create your own davinder singh dictionary
859379 do you know what its like for singaporeans to squeeze like sardines smell each others breath in mrts and have to wait sometimes for a half hour for the bus to arrive

859384 i am not a great fan of dr chee soon juans methods many years ago when he was about to go on his hunger strike mr chiam see tong his sdp party chief called me and asked me to try and talk him out of his impending action i tried but failed and i told chiam he was too obstinate to change his mind
859385 it is one thing to disagree with a persons ideology his methods and his political agenda by all means attack his thoughts his values and his principles by all means criticise him with the harshest of words on his methods and his agenda but to suggest that a person may be mentally not right when there has never been a psychiatric examination is the meanest thing to do
859386 i bought the book at dr chees book launch in june 2005 shortly after i was elected into wps cec my presence was reported in the papers by reporter aaron low from the straits times how do i remember this well the memories are clear because i perceived a near censure from the wp cec for getting too closely involved with sdp and dr chee i never understood why then but now i do

859404 just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down the medicine go down the medicine go down
859405 thank you rodan i appreciate you bringing me the news does berrick know where is cillian now
859406 abrianna where are you going why are you in such a hurry
859407 just keep up brother mine you are going to see years of planning come together in such a way that will astound even you
859408 thorp family for such a time as this god has called you
859409 we however in order to do our part must quickly return to the castle
859410 in short order the thorp family and abrianna were entering the castle she barely crested the doorway when she began to yell orders aidan turned his head away struggling to keep a straight face once a bossy little sister always a bossy little sister
859411 okay then well while id love to offer you all a place to rest this evening im afraid im going to have to ask you to bear with me just a bit longer as there are many pieces of our little puzzle that must all fall into place tonight while we wait for some of those pieces let me show you to your rooms and you can at least allow the youngest children to rest
859412 how are you holding up but i knew the risks of this life before i ever agreed to marry him he spent long hours trying to talk me out of it during our courtship i had no idea life could be so hard nor so sweet either it is a risk i was quite willing to take
859413 aidan i can never thank you enough for all that you have given and done for me for us this could never have happened without you you have no idea i think of the gift that you have given to the people of dalravia
859414 i think dear sister that the gift you have given is greater still both father and son truly you have given all that any woman could ever be asked to give up
859415 aidan do not think more highly of me than you ought for there is no part of me that could have done this outside of the lord giving me a special grace
859416 milady we have need of you in the great hall please come quickly things are moving along very fast
859417 for such a time as this aidan for such a time as this
859418 abrianna yer folks they be one of the homes whats been torched
859419 im telling you i saw someone fall down here just as i was coming to your door but be careful i didnt recognize him he might be corcovan
859420 i will be careful but if he was thrown as hard as you say he was i doubt hes going to have sufficient strength left to cause me much harm
859421 abby you mean abrianna youre calling our queen abby have you lost your mind man
859422 would you just be quiet and get me out of the rain
859423 not so fast queen graceful youve got a broken leg and im not moving you until we can get it braced
859424 are you okay really i know this leg has to hurt like fire and ive sent logan for some wood to brace this but how are you
859425 ive just finished four hours of battle and id rather enter right back into it than to face that temper
859426 i have spoken to several of the men one remembers hearing someone tell abrianna that her parents home was one of the houses that had been torched one of the groomsmen remembers seeing her take her horse he doesnt believe she was in any danger when she was there would you like me to form a party to go to her parents house
859427 no friend forgive my temper i cant believe she would do this without even letting anyone know spend time with your family get something to eat you have served the kingdom well tonight and i am grateful for your help now rest i will go after my errant wife
859428 aidan would you please ask seana for something for this pain i dont think i can endure it much longer
859429 sure and she is getting something my sweet but she is also caring for two babes
859430 woe to me for i am lost for i am a man of unclean lips
859431 your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for
859432 by the time cillians raiding party stopped for rest alasdair was bruised and bloodied
859433 instead he gave himself over to prayer knowing that the next steps of this process would totally be upon abriannas shoulders
859434 abrianna took the time before entering the great hall to quickly change from her riding habit to a dress
859435 entering the hall she turned to survey all that was happening there
859436 she stared fiercely at the man who was standing at the head of the band of raiders
859437 so berrick what vileness has spewed forth in my hall this evening
859438 abrianna even though speaking to berrick had yet to take her eyes from hrafn
859439 milady he wishes to speak to you of the kings return
859440 ahh so there was emotion behind those eyes sheer fury was present
859441 before he could issue one more word abrianna countered her words as glass piercing the skin of that you are correct you will never serve me hrafn
859442 berrick knew abrianna contained strength that he had never seen tapped and after watching her with the loss of her precious son he thought he had seen her stretched to the limits
859443 he wished alasdair could be here for this performance as he knew he would have not only enjoyed it but made fun of her for it later
859444 hrafn was taken aback at the force the power behind abriannas words to him but it was only reflected in his eyes for a moment
859445 son your mother and i need to speak with you
859446 boys what i have to share is going to seem very strange and difficult for you to comprehend but it is vitally important that you listen carefully for what i have to say is a matter of life and death
859447 seana came in closer and held aidans hand while you were both born on the same night you are not twins
859448 emerick you are six inches taller than eadbard did you never wonder about that
859449 aidan stopped speaking for the knot in his throat was so great
859450 at that point seanas tears which had been silently falling were now gushing down her face
859451 emerick please know this is not how we intended to tell you but the events of this evening only made it all the more necessary
859452 and emerick as your mother as the woman who has had the privilege of raising you you must understand that the price your real mother has paid to protect you is greater than anything i can fathom
859453 emerick looked at his twin his cousin and smiled gratefully with a touch of sadness
859454 i guess if i am honest i have known all my life that there is something different about me from the rest of you
859455 as he asked this question there was a knock at the door
859456 isaac said to jacob come near so i can touch you my son to know whether you really are my son esau or not
859457 emerick abrianna needs you to be ready to join her
859458 these father someone seriously wants me to wear these if so then perhaps meegan could go outside and weave me a ring of flowers to wear in my hair and i can dance my way into the great hall the queen can tell her enemies that her son has been hiding himself in the castle as a jester
859459 i will find someone who can help us find something different for you to wear
859460 well aidan thorp this is an interesting place to meet up with you what are you doing here are you visiting abrianna now
859461 its really a long story but abrianna has asked for my uh son emerick to join her in the great hall but the clothes that were left for him are well ridiculous
859462 how old is he how tall is he is he your height i can find him something else to wear but i need to know how tall he is
859463 hes almost as tall as alasdair hes built just like him in fact long legs and broad shoulders
859464 ill be right back then i know just the thing for you
859465 as i was just telling you i think you are mistaken about the state of things here in dalravia i think cillian is mistaken about the state of things here we are not in need of his taking over our land he may have slain alasdair if so so be it she could hardly get the words out of her mouth but she knew that it was needful so she made the choice to not think about what she was saying but if that is the case then we have another who would take his place
859466 you are a liar you have no one here to rule but you we have been watching your country we know your situation there is no one to challenge cillian for the throne and he will come and take it
859467 hrafn i assure you of all my sins lying isnt one of them however by all means wed love for cillian to come here and try to remove the throne from our next king i have an entire army most of them here in this very castle who would like nothing more than to kill every one of you in defense of their king
859468 cillian will come he is coming in fact nothing you do can stop him he will have you for his wife and he will rule dalravia
859469 ahh there you are darling come sit in your fathers throne
859470 he might very well especially in light of his concern for his dear dear father issue a declaration of war and contact our allies for assistance
859471 alasdair has been trying to avoid all out war but with just a young son and his horribly emotional mother at the helm of the country one simply cant expect such restraint to last forever can one after all we would merely be responding out of our fear for the life of our king emotions can cause one to do such rash things
859472 perhaps youd like to deliver the message to your king that dalravia and her new king are doing just fine and in no need of his attention
859473 being the emotional creature that i am though you probably ought to hurry or i might just convince my son that hrafn came with less than pure intentions and have him and all his men thrown into the dungeon one just never knows with women do they
859474 keep in mind behind her back we all call our queen herodius i wouldnt be the least bit surprised if its your head she asks for next
859475 you can connect any pc or laptop to it and it will double as a pc monitor so you can use it as your pc monitor while recording in the background
859476 you can see whats happening in your store while youre working on your computer
859477 you can set a schedule and archive the data to a network location whether on your local area network or even a remote location over the internet
859478 all you have to do is specify the location and at a certain time for example 7 at night the system will offload the information according to the settings that youve put into the system
859479 we need to catch cillian in a weak moment he is drunk thats to our advantage he is deceived about the scope of his victory thats to our advantage as well it would help me to plan if i could figure out what cillians men are doing they appear to be milling about with no apparent purpose cillian is usually not so lackadaisical with his mens discipline
859480 i am relieved to hear you say that i thought it was just my lack of logistical knowledge their movements make no sense they appear to be loading and unloading arming and disarming all at the same time
859481 you are correct brother i am a patient king most of the time but even i would have harsh words for such random indolence
859482 so cillian what do you intend to do with your prize
859483 she is fair she will fetch a good price in the slave market
859484 too fair for another to enjoy maybe i will take this one to wife
859485 we can get closer if they think were one of them
859486 i hope the original owner is enjoying the drab dalravian green
859487 he is enjoying eating the dust of dalravia as will you
859488 jesus said someone touched me for i perceive that power has gone out from me
859489 all the time he mostly did it because it annoyed her but he also did it because he loved her very much abrianna loved all her brothers but she and aidan had a special love for one another that none of the other siblings could share i suspect you and breagan have a little bit of that being twins as much as you love your other siblings theres still something special between the two of you
859490 will you be all right here alone or should i leave brogan with you
859491 dont be silly it sounds as though there is trouble at aidans i know the responsibility you have to them go take brogan he will be a great help to you
859492 berrick is there i have no doubt we have entrusted the care of aidan and his family to him i know he will do his duty i think it would be best for you to remain here
859493 if you tell me i must remain here i will but alasdair i have too much at stake the kingdom has too much at stake for me to remain here
859494 they have taken kallan alasdair those men have taken my daughter
859495 the absurdity is that precisely when the breakdown of the orthodoxy of deregulated markets the small state and corporate privilege is plain for all to see the main political parties are clinging to it ever more tightly
859496 the selling off of the tote would be a catastrophe armageddon for racing there is no correlation between the tote and any bookmaking firm either in ideology philosophy or reality
859497 goldman sachs is acting for the government and it is reported that gala coral is the front runner in the auction it is also goldman sachs that acted as the chief advisor to gala coral last year during their own bid for the tote we all know that goldman sachs is the governments favourite banker but surely it cant be that they are providing advice both to the bidder and to the government

859502 its the first one drug interdiction weve done in quite some time
859503 the bilateral agreement signed in august 2007 arising from the deal but yet to be approved by the us congress allows nuclear trade between the two parties and
859504 the cartels exposure did not change its conduct the price of this precious metal better known in the market in the powdered product called yellowcake has always remained viciously volatile over the past five years the international spot price of uranium has spiraled faster than that of crude oil with its price now hovering six times above its long term average of 10 a pound
859505 in january 2005 seven months before the deal was struck a sharp rise in uranium prices was predicted
859506 the prediction proved right between 2004 and 2007 the spot price of uranium more than quadrupled according to an assessment made in june 2008 the nuclear construction program in india and china is likely to result in a 58 percent uranium price rebound such price fluctuations are not what exactly the doctor would order for a developing economy
859507 rather than integrating india into the nonproliferation mainstream the proposed deal would set a risky double standard that would shatter the delicate bargain upon which the global nonproliferation regime is based
859508 in addition by increasing indias capability to produce nuclear weapons the deal will exacerbate an already perilous nuclear arms race in south asia because pakistan is likely to respond by expanding its own nuclear capability
859509 the bush administrations desire to complete the deal before it leaves office cannot be allowed to come to fruition at the expense of key u s nonproliferation objectives the deal should be left to the next administration and the next congress where we hope its numerous shortcomings will be remedied
859510 i do not share his manmohan singh view that this deal is so important to india that it is worth sacrificing everything for but i do not dispute that his view stems from his conception of national interest
859511 he is coming off as a man who is prepared to martyr his party at the altar of his own beliefs while he heads off to some high minded retirement
859512 on balance the india us nuclear deal as proposed is the much needed recipe to regenerate our nuclear establishment that is stifling under present international regulations if the status quo is allowed to prevail our ambitious plan for nuclear power will not only remain a pipedream but even the status quo will become unsustainable as indian nuclear fuel sources are limited and of inferior quality that make it more costly
859513 for singh who like many indians sees china as much a rival and potential danger as an opportunity a strengthened relationship with washington is the natural route to security
859514 bushs offer is extraordinarily generous india will be quietly recognized as a nuclear weapons power its past sins of defiance of the international non proliferation regimes will be consigned to diplomatic amnesia
859515 india is only being asked to put its civilian nuclear reactors not its weapons program under international regulation in return washington says it will back india in negotiating a special deal with the international atomic energy agency iaea and the nuclear suppliers group
859516 we need a supply of uranium till our thorium reactors are ready the pact will help us
859517 the nuclear power generation npg is currently about 3 of total power generation in the country and with this agreement which will involve transfer of technology as well as continuity of fuel uranium the share of npg will go to about 6 7 by 2020 by importing 12 reactors probably from the west with a total capacity of 12 000 mw
859518 it will be a turn key operation about which india has always had bad experience
859519 there is no need to put such a great emphasis on nuclear energy as if the countrys future depended on it we need to build good expertise in all aspects of power by focusing on modern technological aspects as well as investing in alternative energy sources the nuclear aspect of the deal can wait but the greater technological cooperation between the countries must be given priority
859520 in the old city of delhi the area around the historic jama masjid there is a palpable anger against what the muslim residents see as this governments apparent embrace of the us
859521 i will defy the party whip and vote against the upa government on nuclear deal during the confidence vote on july 22 i have support of around seven party mps the deal is anti muslim and we are against it more so because it is being promoted by the us which is an anti muslim country
859522 mim will take a decision on july 19 after consultations with party president sultan salahuddin owaisi
859523 why drag us in the nuclear deal drag us in building a new india where we have a equal role to play
859524 why is there an assumption that there is something like a
859525 instead of thinking what you should get from india why dont you think that what you can do for india
859526 with such issues in our midst when people fight about haj subsidy right to get keep multiple wives and reservations in government jobs to get a share of the
859527 i do not believe in reservations just because someone is poor the person should deserve support and not take it as an entitlement

859545 in the last three years it had almost become a habit to tell our business partners that well just take the next flight and come over for a meeting that is not really the case anymore
859546 earlier we used to fly in people for interviews not anymore we use a lot more of video conferencing now
859547 there has been a 10 15 drop in corporate movements if fares go up anymore and with inflation the way it is corporate travel will take further hit
859548 while we always look at cutting costs for routes like chennai bangalore it might be cheaper to travel by road
859549 it is for destinations like goa from mumbai which is an overnight train journey that there would be a shift
859550 even though the overall air travel has come down we have seen our percentage of corporate travellers increase from around 40 a few months back to 49 this month

859723 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
859724 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
859725 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
859726 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
859727 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage

859777 my friend swears she read that it is legal and advisable when turning left at a traffic circle assuming no traffic to immediately turn left upon arrival at the circle rather than looping around the circle to reach the left hand street
859778 obviously this doesnt work at multilane larger circles but what is proper at the smaller neighborhood circles throughout seattle
859779 while a left turn can generally be performed safely in front of a neighborhood traffic circle since they are typically located on low traffic volume and low speed residential streets
859780 the upshot of all this is that cars heading north are blocked behind the cars trying to turn left many then try to pull over into the other lane which is crowded and results in further chaos

859807 when we plant a rose seed in the earth we notice that it is small but we do not criticize it as rootless and stem less we treat it as a seed giving it water and nourishment required of a seed when it first shoots up out of the earth we dont condemn it as immature and underdeveloped nor do we criticize the buds for not being open when they appear we stand in wonder at the process taking place and give the plant the care it needs at each stage of development the rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies within it at all times it contains its whole potential it seems to be constantly in the process of change yet at each state at each moment it is perfectly alright as it is

859824 were hopeful that there wont be too many cuts but you certainly wont see the sort of growth that youve had in recent years he said
859825 thats our challenge to get around that to work our way through that
859826 were hopeful the banks will just be able to scrape through with steady divs rather than cuts he said
859827 the market is so volatile we are spending bits and pieces but we havent got the confidence to go fully invested given the volatility he said
859828 we still need to get to the bottom of this global credit crisis
859829 while thats the case i think its wise to have a good pool of cash

859834 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
859835 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
859836 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
859837 culinary tours are really offered everywhere all of the big cities
859838 so it was just a matter of time that pittsburgh needed to offer it as well
859839 this is a kind of lake culture its really a treasure
859840 she was living in a foreign country far away from home
859841 it all went really bad they had her go back to pewaukee and milwaukee and leave the children behind
859842 i decided i really wanted to go back and explore reconnect with my u s family
859843 in 1994 i decided i could not accept such a situation
859844 i became her guardian i brought my mother back to norway she moved in with me she was outstanding it was really nice to be connected she got her life she became able to live with the kids
859845 in a society where you can throw things away to have some things with quality and keep them and upgrade them to a level is a privilege
859846 lois likes reese witherspoon because she played a similar part in walk the line
859847 my experiences post flight were ones of not being very productive for quite a while depression and alcoholism things like that i was trying to recover from that and ran into lois afterwards
859848 experiencing certain symptoms of one or more six common mental health problems major depression minor depression suicidal thoughts generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder or ptsd
859849 more specifically symptoms of ptsd depression or both were seen in 6 5 per cent of returning cf personnel these are by far the most common operational stress injuries seen in the cf
859850 the only thing you have to remember is the aspect that if it is ptsd its the post thing we dont know when it will transpire thats just the snapshot right now cumulatively over time how many of 1 000 people who were in afghanistan eventually get it because some may only get ptsd or symptoms of it five years from now thats whats bizarre about it thats a snapshot in time of whenever they did the stats if you want to do it cumulatively overtime who knows how many will develop ptds
859851 in the last two years theres been a real effort to increase the number of mental health professionals so screening and serving the armed forces personnel weve made a post deployment decompression time so coming out of the theatre they have a little time to adjust before coming back to society
859852 weve almost doubled the number of mental health professionals which is difficult knowing theres a shortage of health professionals all across the country so youre competing with the public sector in general for health professionals who are in demand all over the country by and large we know that thereve been deficiencies in the past the armed forces are making great strides in moving forward and trying to address those needs
859853 canadian forces personnel came form different parts of canada but told basically the same story that they were not believed that they were made fun of that they were belittled
859854 i found the consistency of the testimony from soldiers and their families who testified as well of the barriers towards treatment and the barriers towards receiving mental health services that they needed to become well again and strong again which is not there for them each of those soldiers and each of their families told basically the same story and if anything surprised me it was just how similar each of these stories were
859855 ive certainly been in contact for over a year now with that young solider
859856 i wrote to defence minister mackay about that case months and months ago
859857 i had an email from a former client of mine who is in afghanistan right now and she was having some difficulties and she was able to go see the clinical social worker who is there in afghanistan that wasnt available to people who were on tours before so that to me is very preemptive
859858 research has demonstrated that people who are actually treated for ptsd and osi are good to go back to theatre they know what it is they know how to handle it they and know what to do in the situation its a treatable disorder people can go into remission we dont say theyre cured but they go into remission and with proper therapy theyre given all sorts of tools to stabilize to deal with the traumas and as they say theyre good to go and they are
859859 full spectrum high quality health services to canadas fighting forces wherever they serve it is responsible for all aspects of health care and well being of cf members at home and abroad including mental health care
859860 ill just cut up my credit cards once i pay them off and then ill sock away plenty of money for the even greater depression well be a family of scrappy but satisfied bean eaters our neighbors with their updated kitchens and their enormous home equity lines and their brand new cars may gawk at us now planting tomatoes and splashing our feet in the baby pool instead of going to the movies or shopping at the mall but soon theyll be packing their stainless steel appliances into their covered wagons and heading east to look for work while i smugly stand here doing dishes in the 100 degree heat of my un air conditioned los angeles home and feeling proud that all of our penny pinching finally paid off

859867 what would you do if you had only 37 days to live
859868 i definitely wasnt very efficient and didnt have easy innings which made it a tough game
859869 the main thing is we won and we had some big hits and scored some runs early and that made it easy for me
859870 the key to us being successful is we have to pitch and thats the same for most teams
859871 we have pitched awfully well from a starting standpoint and when we had trouble our bullpen has come in and bailed us out
859872 i knew i had to drive the baseball and try to get a double or better
859873 in practice hed tell us hed just need to get the mental reps and see it on the field he thinks with every rep he has a chance to get better youve really got a lot of respect for a guy like that
859874 the guy plays through pain theres a couple of games he probably wasnt healthy enough to play but the guy is relentless hes not going to miss a game
859875 johnny always tells me to sit down and give someone else a rep and i always sneak off in there
859876 but if he says kubiak doesnt want you to go in now ill stand on the sidelines
859877 everyone complains about practice because its so hot but when you stand on the sidelines i want to be out there its so boring standing on the sidelines
859878 last season showed hes the type of guy who puts the team first
859879 but then shell say you need to get something to put on your back
859880 demeco knows our team is riding on him and were counting on him to play big this year
859881 hes a naturally gifted football player hes a very sharp guy a smart guy and he has a good understanding of football
859882 but hes a humble guy and hes hungry to be the best
859883 the first few times you take some of them they are so crippled they cant even sit in a chair
859884 there was one little girl i took for eight years and when she first started going to the hospitals there didnt seem any chance of her walking i was privileged to take her to greenville last year for her last trip
859885 when she walked out of that clinic she walked just as straight as you and me
859886 she had a great big grin on her face and i knew she had been released she came up and hugged my neck
859887 after you take them for a while these people are family
859888 and the best thing about it is we do the best work in the world for orthopedic burns and spinal cords

859892 50 things we are not likely to ever see or hear in the metal world
859893 my wish would be that somewhere along the line with everybody passing the buck something would be done so he can get a chance to have a life
859894 they have no one to talk to after a while they just stop talking
859895 the english book market is the worlds largest and most transnational but the elite group of writers across the globe who can feel sure that their books will be translated into english could all fit around a medium sized conference table and a very interesting meeting it would be

859907 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of our son and brother gerard
859908 he brought honour not only to us his family but the whole country when he became the first irishman to summit k2 on friday
859909 the last few days have been a rollercoaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy his historic achievement and now must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
859910 mr mcdonnell had climbed everest in 2003 but was unsuccessful during an attempt on k2 in 2006
859911 i was on numerous expeditions with ger and he was one of the best climbers in the world
859912 he was safe fast and strong but that isnt anything in the face of nature
859913 gerards love of mountain climbing was surpassed only by his love for his family and friends
859914 our thoughts are with his long time girlfriend annie in his adopted home of alaska where he lived for the last 11 years

859917 when you have time to sit and gaze at a patch of sun on a wall till you have the urge to shut your eyes and imagine that you are on a train on the way somewhere little but not too beautiful and you are travelling on your own with your head leant against the window hair getting warm in the sunshine watching faded green fields pass by until you close your dream eyes and drift off to sleep feeling like everything is right there just out of reach of your fingertips and you just need to stretch a bit further lean a bit more and youll be able to touch everything you ever wanted
859918 yes i lie because i want people to each have a different version of the truth so that no one figures out that i have an agenda and im not sharing it with anyone i have no intention of changing that or even admitting to it and if you call me on it i will always respond with i didnt mean it to be percieved that way because then the problem is with their perception and not with me

859931 exxon mobil is padding the pockets of speculators where they should focus on u s production
859932 instead of idly watching the american economy suffocate under the weight of gas prices exxon needs to spend significantly more on research and development in the vast areas where they are already permitted to drill and have failed to take any action
859933 companies like general electric general motors kodak chrysler carrier xerox and crouse hinds are gone or are shadows of their former selves
859934 our tax code rewards companies that move jobs out of the country
859935 our tax code treats profits earned by foreign subsidiaries of american corporations differently putting companies who want to create jobs in the united states at a competitive disadvantage
859936 my number one priority as a candidate and as a congressman is going to help put us back on the map by creating new jobs good jobs
859937 the campaigns 2nd quarter numbers represent nearly a two and a half fold increase on its previous quarter and a three fold increase on its 4th quarter 2007 results
859938 times are tough for families here in central and upstate new york costs are up and employment is down
859939 but i know our region already has the capital it needs to bring jobs back terrific natural resources some of the top institutions of higher learning in the world and great quality of life
859940 we need new ideas that can bring innovative jobs to our region my plan will improve our business climate to ensure businesses that stay here will remain competitive in the global market our universities are producing incredibly talented graduates it is up to us to provide those young people with attractive opportunities to stay within our community
859941 we will pick up seats in the next election even our colleagues on the other side recognize that
859942 we want to encourage them to stay here and one of the ways you do that and frankly it works better for them as well is to make sure that theres loan forgiveness if theyre willing to make a contribution to their own community
859943 it is time that voters in the 25th district have the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the substantive issues facing our region
859944 voters are tired of just hearing about politics they want to know what we have to say about the issues i have already been discussing the economy the war and the environment and telling voters where i stand on a variety of issues given the vast differences between me and my opponent voters need to see us share a stage and explain our positions
859945 i think its important to let the voters ask us questions we should make these events town hall style to encourage maximum participation
859946 voters of the 25th congressional district are about to elect a new representative to congress and those voters need to know if who they elect will continue down the same path or as i have proposed head in a new direction with new ideas
859947 the text of the letter which was hand delivered to sweetland is below
859948 it is time that voters in the 25th district have the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the substantive issues facing our region
859949 voters are tired of just hearing about politics they want to know what we have to say about the issues i have already been discussing the economy the war and the environment and telling voters where i stand on a variety of issues given the vast differences between me and my opponent voters need to see us share a stage and explain our positions
859950 i think its important to let the voters ask us questions we should make these events town hall style to encourage maximum participation
859951 voters of the 25th congressional district are about to elect a new representative to congress and those voters need to know if who they elect will continue down the same path or as i have proposed head in a new direction with new ideas
859952 who espouse aggressive policies to achieve total victory in the war on terror
859953 the time has come for me to step down and leave public office
859954 ive been a part of public policy for twenty years at one level or another and i think its natural its a natural progression it gives you the experience of being able to listen to people make decisions and stand by those decisions
859955 to put ourselves back on the map back on the economic map nationwide and back on the map of young people young professionals who may leave the area as i did once but may have an opportunity to come back and convince them and convince us in central new york that this can be a wonderful place to raise a family and a wonderful place to do business and a wonderful place just to live
859956 they only talk amongst themselves to their staffers and they get insulated and they forget what its like to live in the real world its a mess washington is broken
859957 im one of these folks i dont pretend to be anyone else
859958 my opponent has spent the majority of his adult life as a staffer in the halls of congress and that experience is not the real world
859959 the idea that somehow if you go somewhere else and you achieve things other places that youre disqualified from serving your own community thats ridiculous
859960 and if thats true then were not going to have the kind of representation in washington that this community really needs to really thrive because we do need a congressman who knows what hes doing that can find his office and knows how to get things done and not just sit there and introduce bills that dont go anywhere
859961 i wouldnt want to run for county executive or mayor or governor those positions wouldnt suit my particular qualities
859962 but this job i do believe i can make a contribution maybe where nobody else can im not a huge ego i dont believe that i know anyone elses business but this particular job i have really the best kind of background for and the best energy to do it and that its maybe a calling
859963 ive always done the work put my head down and said im going to do the best i can
859964 im going to make darn sure i can look myself in the mirror every morning and live up to what my grandfather and my father thought i should be
859965 public service professions are vital to creating the kinds of vibrant communities where people want to stay and raise their families
859966 we have so much talent and experience right here in upstate new york thats why its important that we foster an atmosphere that encourages people to enter vital service professions like teaching nursing and other careers
859967 americans and western new yorkers specifically have always proven themselves to be generous and hard working
859968 starting today we need to tap into the energy and creativity of our citizens to tackle our nations most trying problems by attracting our best and brightest into professions like teaching nursing and social work we can ensure secure long term jobs here in western new york helping to reverse our brain drain
859969 we have a real plan to help create needed jobs in western new york
859970 todays discussion was about how we as the future leaders of this region will work together to get results for working families every american has the right to a quality and affordable college education and a good job with solid benefits and we have a great plan to do just that
859971 its impossible for us to raise 900 000 before the election lets be real
859972 but this race isnt about which candidate has the fattest wallet what we have is a very good platform and a candidate who can express himself in a way that leaves no question who the better candidate is
859973 im deeply humbled by the strong grass roots support my campaign is receiving
859974 i am certain that our support will continue to grow and we will achieve victory in november
859975 is your boss a tyrant of machiavellian proportions if it makes you feel better youre not alone according to a study by the employment law alliance almost half of all employees have been targeted by a bully boss
859976 if at first you dont succeed you have to try try again
859977 self you are truly awesome you actually did accomplish something you took the initiative to try to do something for yourself
859978 let the sun shine in and face it with a grin because smilers never lose and frowners never win
859979 but unlike our opponent who has raised most of his money in washington and new york city were going to represent the people of central new york
859980 voters dont care about that what dan maffei cares about and what voters care about is bringing good paying jobs back to central new york
859981 unfortunately the opposition seems to be turning this race into who has the most money
859982 but its about the candidate its about the candidate whos going to do the most for upstate new york
859983 this is a candidate and campaign management training day to give people the basic idea of what they would need to do to run
859984 we want to build the confidence to go out there and get involved
859985 we believe voters are anxious to hear what candidates have to say now and not later
859986 i think voters need to realize theyll be electing a new congressman for the first time in 20 years
859987 i was very surprised to hear he was coming out with tv ads so early
859988 it tells me his three or four year campaign has not really taken effect in the 25th congressional district i think his name recognition is low i think his campaign is truly worried
859989 we need to be able to communicate dans message of change and a new direction for central and upstate new york to as many people as possible between now and november
859990 voters are anxious to hear what the candidates have to say now not later dan maffei wants to get his message about jobs and a new direction for upstate new york out to the voters every chance he gets the ads will tell dans story and begin to lay out his plans to bring jobs back to central and upstate new york
859991 i have traveled across this district countless times and talked to so many people over the last several months and i learned so much
859992 we need jobs we need to rein in soaring gas prices and we need to finally end the war in iraq most people agree with my message and thats why i have garnered such strong financial support there is no doubt this region has suffered tremendously over the past eight years but the people of this district are resilient and i know we can do better if we have the courage to change
859993 now im running for congress because i know if we stay and fight together we can make upstate new york great again
859994 we have a mountain to climb we have four months to make this happen but fortunately what we have with dale sweetland is he has a proven record of public service when you meet dale sweetland you would ask yourself why cant all of our candidates give me this feel of honor and integrity and hard work
859995 were setting up events and just getting dale sweetland in front of the people
859996 we dont have some washington firm doing all our filing data for us so we dont have all of our final numbers just yet
859997 were going to see some positive activity out of washington
859998 by the time i went to my 10th high school reunion most of my classmates had left
859999 maffeis fundraising advantage and exposure has led cq politics to change its rating on the race to leans democrat from no clear favorite
