250019 we continued at the same pace and ended up increasing our lead we pushed as hard as we did this morning and managed to extend our cushion to 13 9s tomorrows stages are narrower and covered in gravel and the day promises to be just as long we didnt want to finish in second place this evening and waste all the hard work we put in to pull out tonights gap well see later whether that was the best tactic
250020 i enjoyed the fight especially driving in front my family and friends the battle is almost as close as last year when i fought with marcus gr nholm this afternoon especially was good i drove as hard as i could and made no mistakes im a little frustrated that i couldnt do any more i could have taken risks but thats something i didnt want to do road position wasnt an issue and i didnt let retirement affect me i just tried to do the best job for myself and ford everything is so close between us that im not going to take any gambles by changing the settings on the car there are many new stages tomorrow so anything can happen on roads that we dont know so well
250021 today has went well and its been a great start to the rally for me the car has been working well but we started off slowly this morning as it took some time to find a good feeling with the rear of the car but the mechanics have done a great job and you can see from my times that the feeling is better now and i can push the way i like to with no test before the rally its been good to see that we have got off to a flying finnish start and be on the podium at the end of the first day
250022 we were very lucky today on the last corner of stage 9 when i just cut a bit too much and touched some bushes but ok its no big problem now i wasnt able to keep the pace towards the end of the day and henning has managed to get ahead but its fine hes my friend and i dont mind him sweeping the road for me tomorrow it has been a good day it took us a while to just get up to speed this morning but my confidence is better now the car and the pirelli tyres are working well so i can push some more tomorrow
250023 we all know that the local government strike was two weeks ago and that the council would have problems catching up with the work staff were pulled off the recycling rounds to help collect refuse
250024 people were not surprised when recycling boxes were not collected the first week
250025 we did have a problem with collections in the chester road area of the town because of resurfacing work and temporary road closures most of the problems have stemmed from people not putting boxes out or taking them in

250027 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
250028 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
250029 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
250030 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
250031 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video
250032 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
250033 in patients with serious respiratory illness without an identified etiology clinicians should think about viruses
250034 when we called other hospitals in the portland area we almost fell out of our chairs because they all had seen recent severe and fatal cases of adenovirus
250035 infection control was a great concern to hospitals that saw multiple cases
250036 many patients were isolated with severe acute respiratory syndrome like precaution there was a health care worker at an icu taking care of one of these patients who was subsequently admitted to that icu with adenovirus 14
250037 thats our only known possible case of transmission but we cannot be sure it was not acquired in the community

250063 a certain man was giving a big dinner and he invited many
250064 and seeing the multitudes he felt compassion for them because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd
250065 therefore beseech the lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest
250066 the power of god is far above all rule and authority power and dominion and every title that can be given not only in the present age but also in the one to come
250067 it is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with your fathers saying to abraham and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed

250069 and as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
250070 heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out demons freely you received freely give
250071 now great multitudes were going along with him and he turned and said to them
250072 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yes and even his own life he cannot be my disciple whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which one of you when he wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all who observe it begin to ridicule him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king when he sets out to meet another king in battle will not first sit down and take counsel whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is still far away he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace so therefore no one of you can be my disciple who does not give up all his own possessions therefore salt is good but if even salt has become tasteless with what will it be seasoned

250081 a visceral horror thriller that follows a firefighter who is nearly killed during a failed rescue leaving him badly scarred both physically and emotionally to recuperate he is taken to a secluded nursing home where the elderly residents appear to be suffering from delusions but after witnessing a violent attack he soon realizes that the screams behind the walls are caused by more than hallucinations and the residents are being preyed upon by twisted monstrous nightmares that lurk within the home itself
250082 we had another significant quarter of annualized double digit growth accented by continued operational improvements and again exceeding our plan
250083 from our product portfolio private racks continue to accelerate and contribute significantly to our revenue growth
250084 the outage we experienced this quarter was clearly serious and difficult and we recognize the negative impact to our customers
250085 we have conducted an exhaustive internal review and have concluded this was an isolated incident we also have taken additional precautionary steps to examine all of our data centers and we are confident that they are all in excellent working order despite this temporary setback we continue to exceed the market growth rate estimates and our outlook is positive
250086 the planet again produced a record quarter with the highest year over year growth rate in more than a year and a half
250087 while our outage was challenging we took every measure to minimize customer impact and believe there will be little customer loss the majority of the financial impact is fully covered by property and business interruption insurance finally we continue to invest in people and infrastructure to accommodate our growth

250107 there was not a lot of flamenco then it was not big at that time
250108 as i got older and more involved with fiesta i picked spanish dance there were more traditional spanish and mexican dances performed then
250109 i danced up the street from cabrillo to micheltorena followed by a court of spanish dancers from her dance studio
250110 the studios traded the opportunity to have the spirit each year and the girls who wanted to try out did the el presidente that year was george castagnola and the old spanish days committee actually picked the spirit from the girls that tried out
250111 just a spotlight on the double door as i entered the stage and danced an opening number opening the noches de ronda show every night at the courthouse and the many private parties where i danced
250112 we had a small part but it was not as big as it is today it was important and it was the goal of every girl involved in spanish dancing it was the icing on the cake the study hard work and practice paid off and made you feel special
250113 with the cost of gas and food continuing to rise these 300 recovery rebates could make a real difference in the lives of many of our most vulnerable citizens
250114 low income seniors and disabled veterans are among those who would most benefit from this program i hope this announcement will serve as a timely reminder to them and their family friends and neighbors that they still have until oct 15 to file and get their 300 rebate ensuring every eligible citizen gets their recovery rebate is not only good for them but it will help boost our local economy

250116 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states
250117 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
250118 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
250119 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
250120 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
250121 but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream
250122 what youre going to see is a great debate which is what the american public deserves none of this negative stuff though you wont see it come out of our side at all
250123 you know it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany
250124 focused on the development of an enormous image of celebrity status
250125 a respectful campaign focused on the issues and values that are important to the american people
250126 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
250127 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency how sad
250128 repeatedly challenged the democratic front runner to join him there and see the situation on the ground before concluding that u s efforts have failed to get the war torn nation back on track
250129 barack obama has only visited iraq once and that was 871 days ago
250130 obama has done shockingly little to educate himself firsthand about the war in iraq instead he displays an arrogant certainty gained on the campaign trail obamas failure to visit iraq listen and learn firsthand and witness the surges progress demonstrates weak leadership that disqualifies him from being commander in chief
250131 to comment on savages statements without reference or citation to them would not only render cairs criticism less reliable but be unfair to savage
250132 hey savage not only was your lawsuit frivilous and vindictive but next time you want to file a lawsuit why dont you find someone who knows how to write the whole thing up
250133 the network is satisfied that he did not mean any disrespect to autistic children or their families but was instead reiterating his longstanding concerns on public health issues
250134 liberals are ruining the country and democrats have tied t his countrys hands in the war on terror and have ruined every institution in america with the aid of the major media outlets
250135 spoken to the issues or spoken on behalf of the african community
250136 that doesnt mean im always going to satisfy the way you guys want me to talk which gives you the option of voting for someone else which gives you the option of running for office yourself
250137 but the one thing that is important is that were respectful toward each other
250138 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
250139 a lot of us are dealing with this in different ways
250140 sometimes im happy go lucky sometimes im a little bit more touchy but things like this help
250141 we didnt know anyone on the bridge but as we walked under the freeway overpass near the basilica i said to my husband how could something like this happen
250142 our thoughts go out to those who perished one year ago
250143 we remember and celebrate their lives and we are once again reminded that life is fragile
250144 our faith has become the bond that weaves us together but it would be a mistake to say its over the challenge now is to sustain our compassion if we learned anything from one year ago its that none of us are alone in the beloved community of minnesota

250149 last night they were unbelievably focused they were serious you get around our guys and i think youre going to see a little bit of a different mentality on the practice field and in the meeting rooms i think that they sense that this has the chance to be a very positive season for our football program
250150 you hear about peyton manning and tom brady i watched up close and personal with bernis kosar and troy aikman ive seen some quarterbacks who were just obsessed over watching film and you see that with t j
250151 going through the spring and watching as much film as possible it helped me learn a lot better
250152 you have to look at the defense theres a little checklist we go through you look at the front we look at where you are on the field the formation the coverage everything its kind of hard ill be watching a football game on tv and ill catch myself doing that and i cant even enjoy it
250153 we have guys that have game experience and theres no other experience better than that
250154 thats whats going to take us over the edge thats whats going to help us in the fourth quarter to win those close games thats whats going to help us win in the long run
250155 coach everett has really changed our mentality to get us to become a more nasty defense play harder and swarm to the ball
250156 we need to understand situational football much better than we did last year
250157 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this

250160 chevron hires lobbyists to squeeze ecuador in toxic dumping case
250161 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
250162 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications

250255 this is significant triumph for our prime minister over someone whose name i seem to recall sounds very much like something used to build interior walls
250256 who says that ehud olmert is the least popular leader in israels history the numbers show that this simply isnt quite true
250257 remember that the people who chose none of the above were clearly referring to tzipi livni and shaul mofaz since they are the only ones who came out above none of the above in the poll so these 11 6 of the kadima electorate obviously prefer ehud olmert to livni and mofaz they simply chose a more emphatic way of stating their revulsion to those two rather than merely stating their obvious preference for olmert
250258 as prime minister olmert has seen first hand the results of rash decision making by earlier prime ministers and has learned that putting off crucial decisions until later or making avigdor lieberman make them and take the blame for them is the essence of great leadership clearly the israeli people want an undecided prime minister and ehud olmert is their choice for the job
250259 ehud olmert has shown that he has what the voters want and momentum is on his side if elections are held at some point in the future there is a distinct possibility that hell be elected to something

250329 also not true that the majority of the congregation desired unity
250330 the people who formed st timothys anglican however did have a choice in leaving their property
250331 i think they had been interested in buying it but when that didnt work out they did the honorable thing by walking away from the property
250332 no one can enter a strong mans house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man then he can rob his house i tell you the truth all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never be forgiven he is guilty of an eternal sin
250333 wilkie i dont think its right of you to say that the episcopal church is a non christian church
250334 they were wrong when they said the diocese forced the congregation out the bishop might have demanded that the clergy leave but he would not have told the congregation to leave too
250335 revelation 21 6 is not a quotation from christ its an opinion expressed by john the elder
250336 yes thank god i wouldnt be here if he didnt was it just me or was it anybody else that he

250346 we are thrilled to have dale returning to his roots to become our head coach you only have to spend a few minutes with dale to understand the passion that he has for this franchise and that enthusiasm and excitement will be contagious for everyone around him i have watched dale grow as coach over his time in notre dame and i have always appreciated how his teams play discipline hard work and speed were dales trademarks as a player and i believe those are the same characteristic we will see from our team in the years ahead
250347 its a great honor to be chosen by the parker family to lead this great organization i have very deep feelings for the organization and look forward to the challenges that lie ahead
250348 im very excited for the opportunity to work with dale again its going to be tough losing curtis but i believe that dale is the right man for the job when curtis left i was hoping that dale would get the opportunity to join the organization and i am really looking forward to the upcoming season

250350 to expand and protect settlement activity and the relatively unhindered movement of settlers and other israelis in and out of the west bank
250351 intimately linked to maintaining settler access and quality of life
250352 continued to have the worst performing economy in the middle east north africa sub region
250353 the age long dream realised the ancient promise redeemed the promise that even amidst suffering you will find your way home to the fields and shorelines where your ancestors walked
250354 an unbreakable partnership based on shared values of liberty democracy and justice
250355 was not based on security considerations but to perpetuate and expand the settlements
250356 the impacts of the aid boycott in 2006 and 2007
250357 increased donor assistance while welcome will not be sufficient to turn around the economic downturn which has pervaded the palestinian economy since 2000 without significant and long term removal of such restrictions
250358 possibly the most rigorous form of international sanctions imposed in modern times
250359 compel hamas to change its ideological stance or to bring about regime change
250360 abbas formed a government of national unity with hamas in a desperate attempt to end the slaughter the quartet including britain moved quickly to avert the threat
250361 a new fatah hamas power sharing arrangement is a prerequisite for a sustainable
250362 imperative of palestinian national reconciliation remains as urgent as ever
250363 the decision not to speak to hamas in 2007 following the mecca agreement has been counterproductive
250364 urgently consider ways of engaging politically with moderate elements within hamas
250365 a negotiated settlement with hamas with a view to re establishing a national unity government
250366 it remains important to bring hamas into dialogue and into the peace process
250367 without some kind of reconciliation between hamas and fatah and without international engagement of all stakeholders the peace process will not succeed
250368 life is a daily struggle even to get enough to eat
250369 part of a political strategy to get hamas to sign up to the quartet principles
250370 an unprecedented escalation in human rights violations in the gaza strip
250371 the single biggest impediment to realising a viable palestinian state with territorial contiguity
250372 exert ed sufficient pressure on israel to open the crossings
250373 often stops short of explicit condemnation of the closures and the restrictions
250374 the uk government should have acted more robustly undertaking practical steps to secure the opening of the gaza crossing points and address settlement expansion in the west bank
250375 to create a rapid and convenient road network for the settlers
250376 route into the west bank appears to protect the presence of major settlement blocs in the west bank rather than the security of israel
250377 an agreement based on the 1967 borders with jerusalem a capital for both states and for fair and agreed arrangements with refugees
250378 the economic forecasts remain poor without a fundamental change in the current restrictions on movement and access
250379 palestinian economic revival is predicated on an integrated economic entity with freedom of movement between the west bank and gaza and within the west bank
250380 conditions in the occupied palestinian territories are close to melt down
250381 since 2006 poverty has shot up two thirds of palestinians now live in poverty a rise of 30 per cent last year the number of families unable to get enough food has risen by 14 per cent more than half of all palestinians are now are food insecure unable to meet their families daily requirements without assistance the health system is disintegrating
250382 international aid as a battering ram to force through political change
250383 the result of deliberate and reckless shooting and artillery shelling or air strikes by israeli forces carried out in densely populated areas in the gaza strip
250384 regime change rather than security probably explains israels punishment of gaza reported last year
250385 it would be disingenuous in the extreme to minimise the role of outside players in the collapse of the national unity government the u s and the european union in particular by refusing to deal with the national unity government and only selectively engaging some of its non hamas members by maintaining economic sanctions and providing security assistance to one of the parties in order to outmanoeuvre the other they contributed mightily to the outcome they now publicly lament
250386 the international community withheld support for the national unity government itself an attempt to establish a stable and functioning government in the territories and bolstered one side against the other which increased tension between hamas and fatah
250387 if this national unity government had been given greater international support it could have provided a gateway for greater dialogue and negotiation and at the very least kept the palestinians united
250388 expanding the offer that we have already made of training for palestinian police and security forces
250389 direct result of the policies advocated by fatahs old guard and us officials in charge of palestine policy
250390 reports of a controversial us sponsored plot to oust hamas from power
250391 the building up of fatah security forces with the assistance of donors led hamas to take control of gaza in june 2007
250392 un was pummelled into submission says outgoing middle east special envoy engineering a coup in gaza
250393 we have to make them the palestinian people much thinner but not enough to die
250394 determination to bring down hamas rather than to build up a palestinian state
250395 israel has used f 16 fighter aircraft and apache combat helicopters to bomb lebanese and palestinian towns and villages these contain significant uk components including missile triggering systems for apaches and head up displays for f 16s
250396 see to it that any impediment resulting from the construction of the wall to the exercise by the palestinian people of its right to self determination is brought to an end

250445 you have to go see about a someone you dont even know yet
250446 prove the fcc is not having a one night affair with network neutrality
250447 indeed i have consistently opposed calls for legislation or rules to impose network neutrality
250448 like many other policy makers and members of congress i have said such legislation or rules are unnecessary because the commission already has the tools it needs to punish a bad actor

250453 with the first phase of the iphone 3g launch in the rear view apple inc is now shifting much of its focus towards product refreshes targeting its two other revenue drivers and is advising resellers to be prepared for product shortages in the interim
250454 more specifically the cupertino based company in recent days issued an advisement bulletin to some of its channel partners hinting at a manufacturing ramp down of ipods and certain mac notebook models which will result in limited supplies of those products in the coming weeks
250455 apple is said to have specifically identified 13 inch macbooks and 15 and 17 inch macbook pros but made no mention of the macbook air
250456 is four processing cores inside a laptop overkill probably not for gamers intel is expected to meet this insatiable need for speed when it rolls out it first mobile quad core processor
250457 an intel executive is on the record stating an august roll out
250458 and this may happen sooner in august than later system vendors may go public with information about the quad core mobile processor as soon as august 11 according to sources this is when other processors such as the core2 quad q9650 3 ghz are expected to go public
250459 intel already plans to upgrade the core2 duo processors for its centrino 2 mobile platform with a new range topping model a new leak says with its present mobile chip line topping out at 2 8 ghz the semiconductor firm is reportedly set to introduce a 2 93 ghz model that would share the same 1 07 ghz system bus and 6 mb cache and which would still keep its power usage down to a peak 35 watts rendering it efficient enough to run in thin and light notebooks while offering performance close to the 3 06 ghz core2 extreme
250460 apple is readying a major product transition we know because they told us so in the quarterly financial crime call chief financial officer peter oppenheimer referred several times to a future product transition which i cant discuss today
250461 the mac unit split is 60 40 books desktops the imac desktop line has just been refreshed and the mac pro line while the packaging is getting old has state of the art workstation innards
250462 other than the macbook air though the book line hasnt had a major design refresh in years that is where the transition will be it has the volume and the aging designs to require a change
250463 there are several expensive features in the mac book line that are due for significant upgrades quad core processors power management blu ray optical drives design motherboard flexibility
250464 enough already about the health of apple ceo steve jobs
250465 the smart money is on a revamp of apples notebook line
250466 as much as the macbook pro could use an upgrade apple will probably weave the technology into a smaller sized notebook first says isuppli analyst jennifer callgrove
250467 most important this new smaller machine could sell for less than 800 new price territory for apple the current starting price for a macbook is 1 099 perhaps in time well be so accustomed to using touchscreens that we no longer need a mouse
250468 the macbook might be getting changes inside and out in the next several weeks
250469 apple might have decided its partnership with intel doesnt mean it has to use all of intels products
250470 appleinsider reports that apple could be using a chipset from a different company or even an internally developed one in the next iteration of the macbook expected to arrive in the next six or eight weeks like other notebook vendors apple had been using intels mobile centrino chipsets in its macbook line ever since 2006 but its going to pass on the montevina version of those chipsets this time around according to the report
250471 apparently tired of using the same basic architecture in its computers that its other windows based rivals do apple is thinking about not adopting intels so called montevina chipset the key component of intels centrino 2 platform according to appleinsider
250472 this does not mean that apple would stop using intel cpus just its chipsets which usually controls everything else in a computer appleinsider even throws out there that apple may have its eye on a new set by intel rival amd which includes faster integrated video hyperflash i o and support for hybrid hard drives regular hard drives with flash components means to load faster imagine that intel chips and an amd chipset
250473 the evidence has been mounting over the past weeks and now i can say with reasonable assuredness that future apple notebooks among other products will likely have nvidia chipsets and graphics solutions in them come this fall
250474 just this week information began to seed out that the pending transition for apple would involve the macbook line moving away from intels chipsets
250475 note that this does not mean a move away from intel processors
250476 this does seem to be the most likely candidate for a change on apple product line the centrino 2 launch has come and gone and apple had plenty of opportunity to announce a line based on the new intel technology
250477 nvidia is a much more reasonable solution for apple and what do we see here just released yesterday
250478 to me there is no doubt that come fall you will find updated macbooks and macbook pros with nvidia chipsets and gpus inside
250479 a new kind of trackpad for the next generation macbooks if speculation is correct could lead to the elimination of the classic mouse button replaced by multi touch gestures according to seth weintraub at computerworld on wednesday
250480 referring to speculation about a new kind of trackpad for the next generation of macbooks mr weintraub wondered about the death of the mouse button the author pointed to a youtube video that shows how mac os x leopard can be controlled by classic iphone gestures
250481 for now the only devices which include a multitouch trackpad are the macbook air and the last macbook pro for example this allows them to zoom on pictures stef from montpellier has decided to put one on his macbook
250482 in order to do so he brought the electronic parts specifically the trackpad of a macbook pro to his macbook he sent us a video proving that the system works like a charm
250483 macbook air requires a usb optical drive for the installation of microsoft windows xp sp2 service pack 2 or microsoft windows vista 32 bit versions only the remote disc sharing software included with the macbook air cannot be used to install microsoft windows be sure to connect your external usb optical drive to your macbook air before starting the boot camp assistant

250500 has been credited to the pro israel lobby specifically the american israel public affairs committee or aipac which sent thousands of its members to capitol hill to lobby for the resolution in early june

250540 this long debate has now reached its final stage what a remarkable example it has been of the unbridled freedom of our parliamentary institutions in time of war everything that could be thought of or raked up has been used to weaken confidence in the government has been used to prove that ministers are incompetent and to weaken their confidence in themselves to make the army distrust the backing it is getting from the civil power to present the government as a set of nonentities over whom the prime minister towers and then to undermine him in his own heart and if possible before the eyes of the nation all this poured out by cable and radio to all parts of the world to the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our foes i am in favour of this freedom which no other country would use or dare to use in times of mortal peril such as those through which we are passing

250559 the biotech product land grab by big pharma which intensified when they started feeling the pain of their own blockbuster products coming off patent and facing the specter of increasing generic competition has reached fever pitch
250560 one or two marquee biotech company acquisitions per year have been part of the biotech scene for at least fifteen years
250561 but it looks like the floodgates have opened and these two potential big takeover deals represents the start of what will be a very busy second half of the year for mergers and acquisitions in biotech land
250562 our analysis1 has shown that since 2005 over 60 billion has been invested in biotech company acquisitions by the pharma industry taking into account the market cap of each company at the time of its acquisition the acquisitions of genentech and imclone could potentially add a further 106 billion in biotech value for pharma
250563 biotechs elite companies have spent most of july pushing higher benefitting from a series of favorable headlines and merger fever in the air
250564 this translated into the substantial gain of over 16 in the burrill biotech large cap index
250565 is this the harbinger of a biotech rally certainly as the financial markets settle down we will see biotech benefit from increased m amp a activity i would expect the next few months to be good ones for the industry and by the fourth quarter of 2008 we will begin to see a resumption of biotech ipos getting done

250570 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
250571 its a shame that peoples awareness about the kind of disruption and destruction that is possible came from someone working inside biodefense circles
250572 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks

250592 i was drained and i needed that quiet period if im to peak again in beijing my one big objective between times was getting around the giro and getting a stack of hard miles in my legs that worked out perfectly and it was also a great pleasure to see cav become a superstar it was always going to happen hes a special talent
250593 i went off the boil mentally in athens after my individual goal medal so now its all about the mental logistics of riding up to seven races in five days to win three gold medals physically i can definitely do it its the mental approach i need to nail
250594 my mindset now is that the three gold medals is actually only one gold medal consisting of three disciplines i have to win
250595 and equally if the winning streak continues i have to resist the temptation to declare mentally after the team pursuit and to take a whatever happens happens approach in the madison manchester was a great dress rehearsal i treated each step as if we were in beijing

250660 our fuel load was slightly lower than normal but even so we look competitive
250661 our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us
250662 we have also seen the evaporation of the iraqi middle class
250663 you cannot have any serious advance at the political level inside the country until there is a serious engagement by the us with iran
250664 but this time those seeking to flee may well be stopped at the borders by the countries theyre trying to flee to and you would see big tent encampments emerging there at the borders
250665 those who should be noted for their deportations should be the european countries
250666 most donor countries believe the u s should shoulder the lion s share of the financial burden
250667 we probably wont see any significant returns of the refugees to their homeplaces within the next ten years
250668 of course there are ways to get a good durable settlement inside iraq in a much shorter amount of time than ten years look at all the work all of us have been doing providing guidelines for how that could be done yes i realize it would also require a fair peacemaking process in which all of iraqs neighbors could be involved including iran and syria and saudi arabia but that is possible too
250669 maybe we could see how it could be done but i dont see the political will to do it

250673 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
250674 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
250675 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
250676 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
250677 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
250678 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
250679 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
250680 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water

250688 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
250689 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
250690 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense

250706 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
250707 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
250708 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
250709 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend

250711 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
250712 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
250713 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love

250715 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

250717 medicare is sending a powerful message to hospitals that harming patients will harm their bottom line
250718 this policy will help prevent needless suffering and deaths and ultimately ensure that the health care taxpayers pay for is safe and effective
250719 we are disappointed that medicare has decided to continue paying hospitals when patients suffer from these other serious infections and medical errors
250720 we urge cms to add these and other hospital acquired conditions to the nonpayment list in the future in the meantime hospitals need to improve their efforts to follow long recognized patient safety practices that are too often ignored

250827 for nearly a decade the home office has been secretly approving controversial research projects using profiles from the dna database
250828 no consent was ever sought from the people involved many of whom have never been charged or convicted of any offence
250829 it is outrageous that peoples dna has on five occasions been passed to private companies to pursue their own commercial interests
250830 it is appalling that these big brother practices have been allowed to go on unchecked for so long and with extremely limited ethical standards
250831 unless the government comes clean about exactly what they are using profiles for this highly dubious ethical practice of dishing dna out for research must be suspended immediately
250832 it wont be long until some newspaper commissions a poll as to whether voters prefer him miliband to mr brown

250853 when i go to iraq ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
250854 it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear attack upon israel by iran or originating in iran as an attack by iran on the united states requiring a full retaliatory response upon iran
250855 no one can spend some 10 days visiting the battlefields in iraq without seeing major progress in every area if the u s provides sustained support to the iraqi government in security governance and development there is now a very real chance that
250856 no one can argue that the prospects for stability in iraq are good

250871 the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
250872 i will not promise to meet with the leaders of these countries during my first year
250873 well the first thing wed have to do is make sure that weve got an effective emergency response something that this administration failed to do when we had a hurricane in new orleans

250879 an unacceptable risk to stability in the region and in the world
250880 there was never a serious debate that i know of within the administration about the imminence of the iraqi threat
250881 some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent
250882 it was never a question of a known imminent threat it was about an unwillingness to risk surprise

251003 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
251004 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
251005 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
251006 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
251007 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

251015 its the first study ive done in this field and the results are astounding they indicate a very strong correlation between this type of social factor and the risk of developing dementia
251016 this suggests two influencing factors social and intellectual stimulation and trauma
251017 in practice it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis if our interpretation will hold such an intervention strategy could also be profitable for society considering the costs for dementia care

251032 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
251033 what has happened is the supreme court found that the right to marriage includes same sex couples
251034 this happened after the original title was approved now same sex couples have a right thats recognized and supporters of the proposition want to eliminate that right
251035 cant say with a straight face that this isnt about eliminating the right to gay marriage so whats their problem with this this is a political lawsuit not one about serious legal issues
251036 and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me

251038 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick
251039 i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better
251040 as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface
251041 we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
251042 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us
251043 and that is even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
251044 fridays results are always difficult to evaluate as one doesnt know what fuel loads the other teams are running and this is even more the case here in budapest where the tyres show signs of a lot of graining on the first day
251045 in fact only the performance over the first lap can be considered a valid indication before waiting several laps before the tyres clean up again and one can return to showing an acceptable pace
251046 as usual here in hungary it was a difficult friday because of the dusty circuit
251047 it was hard to draw clear conclusions because there was tyre graining that affected the cars performance and general balance
251048 so we concentrated on finding out what kind of behaviour we can expect from the tyres
251049 i hope we can have another strong weekend because i like this track the car has been competitive recently and we are looking to score more points
251050 the morning went well for me on the dirty track surface and we had no problems with the car
251051 in the second session the track changed there was a bit more grip and the car started to be a bit trickier to drive but overall this was not a bad first day
251052 it was a typical day of practice with a lot of laps covered and lots of data to analyse this evening to be ready for tomorrow
251053 but overall i felt we improved the car very well and we are moving in the right direction we still have a few things to improve
251054 if we can make the most of the final free practice session tomorrow morning we should be able to approach qualifying in good shape and then who knows what might happen on sunday
251055 our free practice programme went well and we have made progress the car was reacting well to the different set up solutions that we tried and so i am quite satisfied with the days work
251056 the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
251057 it was a very productive first day here in hungary on this circuit where qualifying is particularly important its no secret that our fuel load was slightly lower than normal but even so we look competitive
251058 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
251059 in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
251060 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
251061 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
251062 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
251063 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke or mrs albright is or whether that arm can reach me here
251064 such a deal never existed he told swedish public radio friday
251065 both holbrooke and i were actively involved in the 1990s in an attempt to get nato to intervene to have him arrested
251066 who had fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal protection
251067 everything takes place in an atmosphere in which regardless of what truths may be demonstrated in this room no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
251068 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones

251073 i knew i did not want to read the paper today
251074 and my statement was taken out of context i said some areas inside the trailer park were like a third world country not the trailer park itself
251075 i knew i did not want to read the paper today

251166 we have a good handle on our non performing loans and we have been successful disposing of other real estate we sold a number of properties in the second quarter for 1 8 million our delinquency rate on loans greater than 30 days is below 4 for the first time in over a year our 90 day delinquency rate declined six months ago and has remained essentially flat our non performing assets have declined from the fourth quarter of 2007 we believe our loan loss reserve is sufficient at 1 54 of loans given our credit trends and our limited remaining exposure to residential development lending we have less than 3 of our loans in the residential real estate development sector which has proven to be a very difficult business segment for banks our trends for delinquency non accruals and loans in foreclosure improved over the first quarter and charge offs were significantly less than each of the last four quarters

251272 we will modify the way we present sarah to be accurate with the information

251282 everybody wants to save a life we kind of feel like well be saving 40 lives if we can raise enough money to rescue the kids
251283 im just glad the case is finally going to be mediated
251284 someone would have to convince the ag they were really close
251285 mcgraw is probably one of if not the most aggressive state attorneys general in this regard
251286 i dont know that any of them have been enacted
251287 its a case where darrell mcgraw is going to do what he wants to do he thumbs his nose at the democratic leadership in the legislature and they curl up and let him do what hes going to do
251288 it would take a lot to get mcgraw out of office at this point
251289 taking on these industries getting money for the state and becoming a hero he was a leader but other ags are catching up fast
251290 the practice predates spitzer most notoriously in the tobacco litigation context
251291 it is undisputed that attorney general darrell mcgraws office has collected more money in restitutions for the citizens of west virginia that all previous attorneys general combined
251292 the state would not have received the 1 6 billion from the tobacco litigation because we did not have the money to try the case
251293 many states couldnt afford to simply keep this expertise on staff
251294 if the attorneys are being paid by the hour in a competitive bidding process i have no concerns
251295 for those concerned about the rule of law and due process the florida settlement is shameful not least because it strips a currently unfashionable industry of basic protections the rest of us take for granted
251296 as the money sought in such a suit must allege harm to taxpayers realistically outside counsels goal can be different from the goal of the attorney general
251297 the attorney general may want to stop a particular practice and recover fines or penalties the outside counsels goal is to litigate and recover the largest amount possible to increase the dollars they will take from the litigation
251298 a conflict of interest between the states law enforcement interests and the financial interest of outside attorneys
251299 attorney general mcgraws office uses outside counsel because otherwise the office would be unable to hold huge corporations accountable for violations of law
251300 the legislature is unwilling to provide the attorney generals office with money to try significant cases
251301 the attorney generals office is one of the largest law firms in the state with about 200 employees they cant handle these cases
251302 my impression is the contracts do not contain a set rate or percentage basis for compensation
251303 the outside counsel is this case was paid 3 3 million
251304 contingent element in the sense that the issue of determining a reasonable customary fee will not arise unless there is a disposition in favor of the state
251305 i think its legalized extortion that state attorneys general are using their office to secure these settlements
251306 darrell mcgraw does it as much as anyone and for those who contribute to his campaign i think people are sick of it
251307 and the corresponding appointments he has made during his tenure you will easily spot the parallel
251308 tell me where i can sign up for that type of return on investment
251309 if the contracts are not subject to an open public bidding process the state is potentially getting a poor price for legal services
251310 in cases in which the attorneys are paid on a non competitive contingent fee basis less money ends up in the state treasury
251311 attorney general mcgraw does not appoint special assistant attorneys general based on campaign contributions
251312 not many attorneys have the expertise to engage in antitrust litigation
251313 if he wins his office keeps the money millions of dollars
251314 he ought to turn the windfalls over to the state treasurer of course but mcgraw seems to view the money as his own personal hole card in the popularity contest that politics can be
251315 the legislature gets the most heartburn over not receiving the settlement dollars
251316 mcgraw doles them out as he sees fit this is the number one legislative issue in regards to the ags office it cuts across party lines
251317 this turns the principle of the separation of powers on its heads
251318 but darrell and maybe three or four other attorneys general said oh what a wonderful idea im going to jump on the bandwagon
251319 when the state was facing the threat of doctors fleeing the state because of high malpractice premiums a physicians mutual fund was created to address the problem with funding provided by money obtained by attorney general mcgraw
251320 additionally hundreds of millions of dollars have been used to pay down the teachers retirement debt
251321 because of the news articles and problems associated with outside counsel retention
251322 the practice of appointing outside counsel has been given increased scrutiny both inside and outside of an attorney generals office while one size doesnt fit all many states are adopting policies and procedures to deal with the appointment of outside counsel
251323 noting that many attorneys generals are transparent in hiring outside counsel there are a few states where attorneys generals have awarded these multi million dollar contracts to generous campaign contributors with little or no competitive bidding
251324 big tobacco big pharma are the ones complaining they are complaining because we have been effective
251325 a front for billion dollar organizations that issue bogus reports that attack our west virginia courts
251326 arta is a front for open government and has gained a lot of support from state ags and candidates for its openness agenda
251327 the agenda is viable because it is the right agenda for taxpayers and transparent government

251453 that would have the effect of encouraging health care institutions and individuals to refuse to provide birth control to patients who need it
251454 we urge you not to pursue this course of action
251455 as it would seriously undermine the access of millions of american women to affordable and effective reproductive health care
251456 the regulation directly undermines many important state laws it could threaten rape survivors access to emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms and might even prevent women from learning that this option exists
251457 the draft regulation could deny access to critical family planning for women across the country
251458 in particular the regulation if it is published as it presently exists in its draft form will define abortion as any of the various procedures that result in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation in other words the draft regulation would define birth control as abortion and therefore allow individuals and health care corporations to refuse to provide family planning
251459 agree that increasing access to birth control prevents unintended pregnancies and results in fewer abortions
251460 for the federal government to be telling me i cant provide something that is safe and effective that would be in direct conflict with the physicians oath

251465 the surge has changed the situation not by itself but only in conjunction with several other developments the grim successes of ethnic cleansing the tactical quiescence of the shiite militias and a series of deals between u s forces and sunni tribes that constitute a new bottom up approach to pacifying iraq the problem is that this strategy to reduce violence is not linked to any sustainable plan for building a viable iraqi state if anything it has made such an outcome less likely by stoking the revanchist fantasies of sunni arab tribes and pitting them against the central government and against one another in other words the recent short term gains have come at the expense of the long term goal of a stable unitary iraq despite the current lull in violence washington needs to shift from a unilateral bottom up surge strategy to a policy that promotes rather than undermines iraqs cohesion that means establishing an effective multilateral process to spur top down political reconciliation among the major iraqi factions and that in turn means stating firmly and clearly that most u s forces will be withdrawn from iraq within two or three years otherwise a strategy adopted for near term advantage by a frustrated administration will only increase the likelihood of long term debacle the surge may have brought transitory successes but it has done so by stoking the three forces that have traditionally threatened the stability of middle eastern states tribalism warlordism and sectarianism states that have failed to control these forces have ultimately become ungovernable and this is the fate for which the surge is preparing iraq a strategy intended to reduce casualties in the short term will ineluctably weaken the prospects for iraqs cohesion over the long run
251466 when it withdraws from iraq the united states will be leaving a country more divided than the one it invaded thanks to a strategy that has systematically nourished domestic rivalries in order to maintain an illusory short term stability

251548 the african presence in mexico from yanga to the present
251549 first it says that our years of work pioneering the green household and personal care products category have paid off in the form of a leadership position thats important to shoppers
251550 but whats most positive about this new research is that it shows that young people are in tune with values of sustainability that those issues matter to the people who are the consumers of the future its one thing for our company to rate highly in a study conducted among affluent mothers or hard core environmental activists but something else entirely to come out on top with people who are just starting out in life and havent yet acquired the wealth or knowledge thats so prevalent in our traditional consumers its wonderful that our message has penetrated so deeply and so broadly and that corporate consciousness is no longer seen as a fringe concern

251557 we are committed to using legal methods for mitigating pilot furloughs
251558 accordingly we are seeking the courts permission to inform our pilots of their right to forego voluntary overtime flying which would reduce the need for any additional furloughs
251559 being furloughed twice in such a short period of time especially when its so easily avoidable would be a tremendous hardship for these pilots and their families
251560 even senior management at our airline has previously acknowledged that our pilots have the ability to decide for themselves whether to perform voluntary overtime flying
251561 hello and thank you for posting pics of the hottest guy sryy i havent been here in a long time i have been very busy with school any questions ask me
251562 based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack
251563 the isi is a very disciplined organization manned by military officials it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda the taliban and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9 11
251564 despite our insistence no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations
251565 weve long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports
251566 there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story
251567 there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
251568 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
251569 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
251570 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
251571 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
251572 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
251573 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
251574 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
251575 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
251576 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
251577 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
251578 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
251579 because what sen obama was saying was that hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates and he understands that and he understands that that will be a source of contention but in no way did he say that
251580 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more
251581 this is not the john mccain voters thought they would be seeing in this presidential campaign
251582 hes not just embracing the rove playbook that people really are tired of hes taking it to a further extreme
251583 this karl rove style ploy misleads people about baracks energy plan and even mocks his ability to inspire voters and bring americans back into the political process
251584 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
251585 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution

251609 it doesnt matter what sort of gameplans you have if you dont turn up with that it aint going to work
251610 i will admit that even i have been a little surprised to find how effectively the ok to wake nightlight feature works what weve found is that kids feel a sense of accomplishment from waiting until the green means go light comes on and take pride in coming to tell parents about a job well done

251632 mijn werk kun je zien als een dialoog met huidige maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen waarin als antwoord op de overheersende seculiere levensopvatting de kracht van het geestelijke steeds meer erkenning vraagt in mijn werk objectiveer ik deze geestelijke kracht ik laat zien dat de geest werkzaam is in het kwantummechanische veld daarnaast laat ik zien dat de individuele geest geen volledige controle heeft over dit verschijnsel en slechts in beperkte mate de fysieke realiteit kan sturen dit maant tot zekere bescheidenheid het zichtbaar maken van deze vraagstukken op een conceptueel doorwrochte en heldere manier geeft een nieuwe impuls tot reflectie voor iedereen die zingeving ontleent aan de overtuiging dat de geest de oorsprong van onze fysieke realiteit is

251750 india has lost a great statesman who believed in pragmatic politics

251752 he was instrumental in the formation of many coalitions at the centre including the one led by me with the primary objective of preventing communal forces from occupying power
251753 in his death the country has lost an eminent personality who always fought for social causes

251761 for many years it had been a practice for kaka to make the morning tea or coffee before nirupama bhabi left home for a religious congregation this morning at 6 30 she found kakas body stiff and cold the doctor declared him dead at 7 30 rigor mortis had already set in and kaka must have died in his sleep maybe after midnight
251762 we greeted each other on thursday morning as well as in the afternoon and he seemed to be hale and hearty he was a prolific scorer for bombay a great team and jovial man
251763 when we lost a couple of wickets he would crack jokes mimic and sing to lift the depression in the dressing room he had a great knowledge of pitch conditions and about the opponents
251764 he had the uncanny ability to make people follow him right from the college days ashok was a hero and idol for all of us
251765 he had a shrewd cricketing brain like his father he would have made a good india captain in my judgment he was wasted by the indian selectors he did not have a settled batting order and that probably affected him its sad ashok is no more
251766 its difficult to carry the mantle of the mankad surname its like asking for the moon ashok excelled as captain for mafatlal in the times of india shield
251767 he did not interfere with my game he just let me play the way i wanted
251768 i was with kaka for 12 years i learned a lot about captaincy from him definitely he was one of the best in india in terms of leadership unfortunately he did not do too well in tests if he had done that he would have probably gone on to lead india he was excellent in man management skills he had his ways to keep the team together the youngsters got a chance to mix with the seniors
251769 oh my god its very sad news he was always a jovial cricketer he enjoyed his cricket and made the people around him happy he was a very knowledgeable player
251770 ashok was captaincy material he was totally into cricket it was in his blood through his father vinoo i have not seen vinoobhai play but listening to ashok about his father was amazing experience thats when i realised what a great cricketer vinoobhai was today is one of the saddest days for me
251771 i have always been his admirer to be honest 75 per cent of whatever i am today is because of him he knew the role to be performed by each player
251772 ashok mankads contribution to test cricket will always be remembered by his countrymen
251773 i was shocked to hear the sad news mankad had a great cricketing brain and was regarded by one and all as a great tactician in the passing away of mankad the cricketing fraternity has lost a great friend philosopher and guide
251774 in this film thalaivar has played a very mature age appropriate role the film highlights the beauty of friendship and has a very nice message

251779 even if the auction process is completed within 4 5 months it will take another 6 months for any operator to roll out their network and launch services by that time bsnl and mtnl can get a foothold into the market

251783 we expect the growth to continue particularly with the forthcoming festive season however managing high double digit growth in the post festive season will be a challenge and therefore the second half of the fiscal is going to be crucial for the overall growth in the industry for the year

251816 it has been a pleasure working with the hmmg in realizing this outcome

251834 theres been a sea change in societal cultural and individual acceptance of cohabitation
251835 a lot of the earlier studies were relying on data that may have been gathered in the late 80s and mid 90s were talking about a moving target the evidence is a lot more mixed
251836 cohabitators 20 years ago were the rule breakers the rebels the risk takers the folks who were perhaps not as interested in marriage and using cohabitation as an alternative to marriage
251837 twenty or 25 years ago if you were cohabiting and then married them the marriage was more likely to dissolve and end in divorce

251853 we are now at the stage where communication is more of a mobile has to whereas 10 years ago everyone had a wireline and if something went down youd obviously have to replace it

251871 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
251872 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
251873 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

251949 however during the past few years weve found that the cost of getting collectable cards has risen and many fans are getting shut out of the fun the autograph cards that weve designed allow people the advantage of purchasing blank cards for specific sports at a reasonable cost
251950 we are expanding our product by offering a universal signature card
251951 we realize that there are other opportunities such as various mediums like television and movies it can be used for any type of celebrity autographs

251960 those kids of yours the ones youre always bragging about this 47 inch lcd is better than them its smarter with a killer video processing chip that helped it ace all our tests syncing up and smoothing out the noisiest screwball video we threw its way the sets better looking than your brats too our blu ray movie was theater quality with a sharp yet natural noise free picture and vivid well balanced color we loved its default settings but olevias myriad picture audio and setup controls make home schooling this baby a breeze and unlike your spoiled spawn it listens even its sound impressed us a rarity for flatscreens but then your kids can probably really crank up the volume too
251961 great buy amazing screen and all the utilities built in webcam mic and veriface technology which lets you login without using the keyboard 1 66 ghz dual core and 2gigs mem you cant beat that vista requires at least 1 gig so dont go for a 1 gig model it has lenovo media center every port you can think of awesome high def sound card havent seen a better deal in a while
251962 this is one of the best laptop by far for the price that is right now i got it for only 600 amazing screen the veriface is way cool to use and show off 2 gig of ram is perfect for vista for now but later on when ram gets cheaper buy 2 stick of 2 gig should be no problem
251963 well see what the doctors have to say when they actually want him to go
251964 hes right on schedule in terms of practicing and running and when we want the live work in a game whether it will be preseason week three or week four well see
251965 the final four was one of the best experiences of my life but having the chance to represent your country and compete at the highest level possible you cant even imagine what its going to feel like
251966 ive heard stories of how special the opening ceremonies are so youre really not going to know until you get over there but definitely i put winning a gold medal up there with winning an nba championship its that special
251967 its an honor for me to be on this team and an honor for me to represent my country in the olympics
251968 ive always dreamed about playing in the olympics growing up watching the dream team and watching them get a gold medal im just thrilled to death to have the opportunity and the privilege to play on this team and look forward to winning the gold medal
251969 williams has the desire and ambition and that is just as important in international competition as talent to have a makeup of guys who are willing to give their time and effort who want to be there and most importantly want to win
251970 i know that illini fans will now watch the olympics with even more interest it is a great source of pride to have one of our own competing on the worlds biggest stage
251971 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts

251973 its been happening since the very first day i got here and im tired of it you try to bend over backward to do the right thing and it just seems to get thrown in my face
251974 i came here to play baseball i took less money i didnt whine or anything and this is the thanks i get i dont need that
251975 ken griffey jr was a big part of this franchise for a long time
251976 so this is the beginning of a new era i guess

251978 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
251979 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
251980 while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
251981 it takes a lot of patience and hard work to get back to where you need to be you wanna keep playing do great things you cant give up youre gonna have accidents and you gotta bounce back im a competitive person i just look at this as a life lesson
251982 when he was down at first it didnt look serious maybe just twisted his ankle
251983 my husband said i think its just a cramp if hes not moving we know our kid hes a tough kid and when he didnt get up we knew it was serious
251984 being around his family seeing different experiences with his family its the same for anybody when you lose a brother or uncle or close friends these are the things that are gonna happen you gotta stay strong and focused basically reiterating over and over that when faced with adversity you gotta keep pressing
251985 then your mentality can be i can go 100 percent theres no doubts in the back of your mind cause then you play timid and less aggressive we dont wanna go back to point a
251986 i told my son just keep working hard g everything will work out

251989 i dont run europe im just a parent making sure my young man does what hes gotta do in terms of his recovery
251990 you cant just get a contract without showing people you can still run and jump hes a quick healer and has done a great job rehabbing not a lot of gms are going to take a chance on him if his knee is not 100 percent

251992 if you had a problem you should call him directly
251993 were not going to respond to anything about the meridian
251994 sat before judicial affairs director joe puzycki with his right eye completely closed black and blue with external cuts to his face he had several contusions on his head and his neck was discolored allegedly from being kicked while he was on the ground
251995 i do know the people in judicial affairs and i know the process and i believe that the process was followed
251996 and i believe there are safeguards in place to ensure fairness
251997 the incident on the street would seem to be a minor catalyst for an event to take place with such aggression as reported by the witnesses
251998 these allegations if true do not describe a heat of the moment reaction but rather describe a premeditated and planned assault which was described as brutal in nature
251999 a path of blood ran from the apartment rug into the hallway and then into the stairwell there were several areas of the apartment rug that was sic stained with blood droppings
252000 the common feedback judicial affairs has heard from alleged victims and witnesses at the party is that justice does not apply when football players are involved
252001 committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation irrespective of the identities and status of the individuals involved
252002 understand where all the rooms are in relationship to each other and how the rooms are accessed
252003 i think it was something how the interview went on espn
252004 the way they chewed paterno up i dont know if it was him getting revenge hes very disrespectful he dont wanna talk he dont wanna listen
252005 he was suspended for the wisconsin game after the season paterno decided to suspend him for the summer he only got charged with disorderly conduct now they wanna punish him again i talked to paterno we talked about him sitting out for the season if he was sitting out he wont be at penn state
252006 i was asking him whats bringing this on my son what have we done that makes you treat us this way
252007 he couldnt tell me hes like you know how he gets his stutter these kids names keep coming up
252008 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
252009 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met
252010 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
252011 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
252012 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
252013 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
252014 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
252015 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video

252144 if you dont attend the swearing in ceremony you will have invalidated 26 seats and well divide them to other parties

252147 but if you dont attend the swearing in ceremony if you want to know you will see
252148 we the norodom ranariddh party want the king to use his role in the constitution to pardon prince norodom ranariddh to return to cambodian politics and social activity
252149 the prince is still very important for the nation in the course of legal democracy and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms
252150 they will not be accused of doing something or mistreated by vietnamese authorities
252151 embassy officials observe repatriations from the unhcr sites to ensure that the departures are conducted in accordance with unhcr and cambodian procedures

252153 i think if royalism has declined it is not linked to political parties which have affirmed they are royalist
252154 but i think after this election they will prepare a draft law to prevent royal family members from engaging in politics
252155 the dodgers get much better this season in exchange for a great young arm who is probably three years away and a third baseman on whom they appeared to place little or no value you have to imagine this is seen as a huge win within the dodgers front office if ramirez now freed from the team that doesnt deserve him stops mailing in various at bats and hits toward the right tail end of his abilities as he hit in april for example the dodgers have just made a quick two win upgrade in exchange for a good player they werent going to use and a quality prospect and they didnt have to add to their payroll the move keeps juan pierre and andruw jones on the bench where they belong and i wouldnt be surprised if the team were to try to outright jones off the roster and assign him to triple a to clear the roster spot the move makes the dodgers slight favorites to win the nl west assuming that they put the right personnel on the field
252156 manny comes from a hitters park to a pitchers park it is unknown whether he bothered to pack a fielders glove if he plays in left the only place he has played he will follow luis gonzalez and juan pierre in a succession of lousy fielding left fielders on the bright side the dodgers have gotten more name players on the other and darker side the team does seem unbalanced a garage full of gas guzzlers and old spare parts kind of like a really good looking edsel with extra wheels but still lacking a carburetor and an ignition switch on the same day the dodgers picked up manny the washington nationals released both catchers paul lo duca and johnny estrada now maybe the dodgers will pick up one of them particularly since the nats will be stuck for their salaries on name and reputation either would be an upgrade in the dodgers backup catcher spot and dodger fans would love to see lo duca back on the left coast the question remains are the dodgers really better or simply an aging softball team masquerading as a baseball team sometimes the girl who looked so good in the bar last night when you were drinking dont quite look the same in the harsh light of the morning
252157 the nicest way to look at this move is that it gives the dodgers a financial no cost upgrade to an outfield hobbled by ned collettis consecutive center field mistakes put manny in left reduce andruw jones and juan pierre to expensive spectators and roll on to the division title a sensible plan no its possible probable even and benching jones might even represent a bit of wish fulfillment mixed with a good dose of reaction formation even so somehow i cant shake the feeling that theyll struggle to bench pierre for being exactly what you should expect him to be and that the speedster will filch a few starts from andre ethier and matt kemp on the days when he isnt starting for ramirez because the big boppers got an owie to massage or a sulky jag to ride out that aside its an obvious improvement to a lineup that needed the help although the problem is whether or not this means that the dodgers will wind up picking up the 2009 or 2010 options if they have to or had to to get his mannyness to agree to the trade a deal that doesnt cost them anything now financially will end up becoming a bit of a millstone since theyll be stuck with an increasingly fragile lead gloved old man in left and if thats what they wanted for their stretch run why not just keep laroche and sign barry bonds its worth asking that question because while the immediate financial expense is negligible where this deal costs the dodgers right now is in talent talent that they need now and will need far into the future laroche could wind up being the best bet to be the pirates token all star for the next five or six years and not simply because a pirate has to go but because there are few better bets to star at the hot corner in the years to come having dealt him future dodgers squads will have to find their third baseman on the free agent market with the man who gave you andruw jones and juan pierre doing the shopping lest they have to return to blake dewitt neither of those things have as much to offer a team as laroche so in terms of measuring the full cost of what adding manny does for this team youve got to throw that onto the scale signing barry bonds would not have cost them andy laroche and it would have involved no more or less of a distraction than manny being manny will no matter how star struck and craven the local media may be during its first exposure to the man laroche was expensive enough but morris isnt chopped liver although less developed having pitched in low a after missing all of 2007 after tommy john surgery hes also talented enough to come back to haunt them
252158 for the word of god is living and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword piercing even to the division of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
252159 these things we also speak not in words which mans wisdom teaches but which the holy spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he who is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is rightly judged by no one

252165 so it seems like to americans like me and other people like you may have flip flopped on what you had said earlier
252166 but what we are talking about here is substance not style
252167 all i can say is that were proud of that commercial
252168 its a political campaign its just part of the process
252169 hes the biggest celebrity in the world as pictures of spears and hilton appear almost as if they were part of the berlin crowd listening to obama
252170 with gas prices soaring obama says no to offshore drilling and he says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real barack obama
252171 until we made this ad we had a hard time starting a national discussion on his positions
252172 if you cant call him a celebrity what would you call him the fuss from obamas camp is unbecoming of a presidential campaign their response is all fussing and guffing of feet
252173 this is an act and react business kerrys response at first was not emphatic enough
252174 what you see so far is traditional negative presidential campaigning
252175 if you start seeing osama bin ladens face morphing into obama or someone runs an ad featuring his middle name thats swift boating
252176 that could happen again if people hear obama speak and say he sounds reasonable
252177 i have a feeling it will get more negative on both sides
252178 though the decline wasnt huge it was very broadly based with only health care and mining showing anything that could be described as strength hours worked per week declined which is a bad sign for future hiring
252179 if we look at the job losses we had during the time people are calling a mild recession which was 2001 we were losing about 180 000 jobs a month at that time so clearly this is a different degree
252180 we dont like to see job losses obviously 51 000 is disappointing
252181 what were seeing is a mild recession interrupted here by a rebate program
252182 once they consumers finish spending these checks well head down again
252183 a sign of how troubled our economy is that some analysts are greeting the seventh straight month of job losses and an increase in the unemployment rate to 5 7 percent as relatively good news
252184 this stimulus should include increases in the federal share of medicaid significantly increase funding for home energy assistance and food stamps and other measures which will provide badly needed stimulus for our economy and help state and local governments and individuals improve the quality of their lives
252185 the fed is stuck on hold trapped between a weak economy on one side and high headline inflation on the other
252186 what could rescue us is oil prices getting back down under 100

252235 we have people working here who have families and theyre having a really hard time just keeping up on their house payments i filled my tank this week and it was almost 50 proctor amp gamble just announced that they were raising their prices 16 across the board these are basics that you have to buy and everything else is going up too people are afraid of losing their homes

252237 yeah its a corrupt culture and everybody knows it although i have to say that im throughly enjoying ted stevens in alaska hes what 84 end of the road dude
252238 well im 57 and i know how things change i was going to the marches and protests in high school and we changed things there was the womens movement and what happened with blacks we protested and organized and things moved
252239 hes a politician but he understands the role of citizens movements he creates hope and raises expectations richard nixon was a law amp order conservative republican but by todays standards his great society program was practically socialism and it was because of the social movements youre talking about when the pressure builds from below politicians have to respond
252240 you know people feel small they feel bad about themselves when they think theyre not making it but now theyre getting mad
252241 i think this is what happens for awhile people think its about their own failure and then they start looking around and see that no one else is really making it either and that its the system thats failing its harder and harder to hold onto being middle class much less become middle class people are starting to push back
252242 no one has any savings theres no margin for error anymore and people are scared its all we talk about

252246 my question is in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead why is it you have not had the ability not one time to speak to the interests of the oppressed and exploited black community in this country
252247 i may not have spoken out in the way you would have wanted me to speak out
252248 but the one thing that i think is important is were respectful toward each other

252256 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
252257 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
252258 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
252259 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured

252264 from foreigners point of view it might seem like a slowdown in reform but fukuda sees it as steady reform
252265 i see this as a cabinet reshuffle to show that fukuda wants to call a general election under his leadership
252266 i think an election is highly likely around the end of year to the beginning of next year but its possible that itll be earlier than that thats what we will be calling for
252267 it sends a signal that the ldp is not coming up with fresh new ideas that i think is going to be a losing strategy i mean he is a throw back to old style politics

252313 ive got to stop saying you go girl to myself
252314 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
252315 john mccains new ad is dishonest and shameful and i say that as the former chief of medical operations senators hagel and reed confirmed to bob schieffer yesterday that senator obama visited the combat support hospital in baghdad as a part of their codel with no media present
252316 in germany senator obama made the right decision to respect wounded troops and the doctors and nurses doing crucial and time sensitive work by not making a visit that was characterized as a campaign event by the pentagon
252317 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
252318 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
252319 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
252320 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
252321 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money

252332 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
252333 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
252334 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
252335 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
252336 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
252337 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live

252339 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
252340 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

252382 its okay im going to call for help ill be back in seconds
252383 yes and it needs to come out but we dont have a surgeon here at the outpost
252384 dr beckett is scheduled to fly here in a few days once hes completed his basic survival training at mcmurdo
252385 yes but it could take a couple of hours of get a helo out here to pick up dr mckay and return to mcmurdo
252386 and less time if you simply put beckett on the helicopter and brought him here
252387 and mckay could be dead in a couple of hours now if you want me to take this to general hammond i will
252388 tell them to put dr beckett on a helo and get him here asap
252389 i dont want to move him but we dont have much choice we dont have clean facilities down here but we do have a field operating theater up top
252390 i cant give him much because he could be under the knife within the hour but itll make the move slightly easier on him
252391 dr beckett get dressed we have an emergency at the outpost leave your belongings someone will gather them up and bring them on later
252392 doc i hear we have an emergency operation for you

252401 when we get to the basement command center we will fire up the isolated com system just like benson directed and then verify that we have access to the centers video and data storage grid with the new filter systems installed down here we will be able to view the entire center security video library as well as bring up any communications that have originated inside or outside the complex with no one suspecting a thing
252402 please keep this circuit clear unless you have emergency business
252403 dean this is benson just calling to make sure youre not having any issues you need help with you will be having company soon and i want everything ready directorate manager kenfer his personal assistant lee melman and i will be down within the hour
252404 everything is going smoothly communications and video access has been established easily and karl is back tracing all lines to ensure they are secure from prying eyes and ears
252405 great ill call when were all heading down by the way is the conference facility furnished adequately and are there supplies present in the kitchen facility
252406 weve got top of the line furnishings conference table with chairs and plenty of food and drink
252407 my guys have everything under control down in the command center
252408 the doctors have examined him and he is being treated for a broken left arm as we speak a few more minutes under the mending ray and he should be good as new just the usual soreness for a few hours
252409 we will have untraceable access to the centers com and video grid for our investigation
252410 i have almost completed the last phase of my analysis of the probe data we will know soon where the orders came from and what they entailed the center may have been attacked but thanks to our precautions no data or personnel were lost im bringing my results to date with me along with my personal comp thats still running the final program
252411 the doctor has just advised me that director kenfer will be coming out in a few moments give us about fifteen minutes and we will be on our way down to command
252412 the boss is ok and we should all be down in about twenty minutes give or take
252413 dont worry this is not the first presentation weve been part of
252414 this is a private line and i dont recognize your transmission code
252415 you remember me dont you mr loomis i talked with you only a few days ago our benefactor appreciates your attempt to derail efforts to uncover who is really behind the missing probe unfortunately my information suggests that the damage suffered today was not serious enough to guarantee our goal the technician assigned to ferret out any and all information leading to the probes loss already had most of the centers priority mission communication records downloaded to personal non network comps for analysis
252416 when the main information storage was disrupted by your attack the cork was already out of the bottle
252417 you might not know everything thats going on ive contracted with someone who has worked for me in the past to deal with the technician you speak of and any friends that he may have recruited to help him i happen to know the information analysis has not yet been completed and there is still a chance i can stop any results from being distributed
252418 there is one more complication that no one expected the probe has signaled that it has regained mission readiness and is waiting for orders from the directorate manager by way of his personal aid this information was costly and we must act swiftly to deal with this new threat
252419 i have access to one of the only two miniature prototypes built to test the time travel technology it is stored off the main company campus in a seldom used laboratory complex all of the facilities equipment still remains in tact the theory back when research was being slowly moved to the main center complex for convenience was to leave everything in place to use as a backup facility for overflow project work this could work in our favor i would need a couple of bodies to act as op techs but it is possible that our problem probe might be intercepted and dealt with once and for all
252420 that is an interesting proposition do you really think you could find and neutralize our problem child
252421 you advised that the probe has initiated a dialog requesting orders in so doing the probe must have provided its coordinates in space and time to the center communications reception center a validation process is automatically done by the reception center to confirm that the communication received is genuine the record of that initial communication with these coordinates can be obtained easily by anyone with my security clearance what we need to do is deliver a communication to the probe using those same coordinates that it will think is the answer to its request for orders our message must be received before the real message from the directorate manager is sent in our fake message we can advise the probe that it must meet with an intermediary at a time and place of our choosing claiming it is necessary before it comes in for debriefing
252422 do you think you have the time to accomplish sending the message and getting the prototype machine ready before the centers people can communicate with the probe
252423 i can get the message out quickly enough i wont have the hurdles posed by the elders commission and center protocol to deal with and i can have a program in place that will allow the real message to be entered but not really sent to the probe without a password from me
252424 i will get you the people you need to man the equipment at the lab but the message is your baby
252425 you can expect our falsified message to go out by this evening but the interception mission will depend on how good your people are and in what actual condition we find the lab and the proto probe oh and by the way ill need an explosives expert to come with me on the mission all probes have hull sensors that record any damage they automatically eject an emergency buoy when damaged beyond repair or are destroyed we want the information buoy to indicate that it exploded an unexplained explosion is more readily believed than any other form of attack
252426 hello mr loomis what can i do for you today
252427 ive got to have some information that just came into the communications center i need locator coordinates that accompany every probe communication during a mission the coordinates are from the missing probe that has just reestablished active communications with the center when retrieved they must be replaced with believable fakes time is critical and risk warrants a bonus as soon as they are in my hands im sending a secure com code where they can be forwarded
252428 ok ill get a hold of my inside agent at the center and should have the information you need before the day is out
252429 this prefix identifier you mentioned can you trace who has the authority to utilize this power
252430 youre suggesting that davis was murdered and that you were meant to be lost in time a chicken without a head as the old expression goes
252431 how long will central consider our situation this spokesperson who is he is he trustworthy
252432 if melman is our life line will he be the one to pass our concerns and the facts of davis loss on to his uncle jordan
252433 sir this is melman there has been an explosion somewhere in the building are you ok im currently stuck inside the lounge lying on the floor and rolling around in my lunch
252434 im alive but injured i was on the way up to the apartment attached to my office for some r amp r when the lift tossed me around quite handily it seems to be stuck at an odd angle in shaft number six and i think i might have a broken arm
252435 i can hear emergency personnel yelling for survivors close to the lounge entrance out in the hall they should have the doors open momentarily i dont seem to have injured anything but my pride i suggest that you end this call and contact security letting them know your situation and the lift number youre in they have a priority emergency management plan which includes the locating and rescuing of all senior management officials asap that should get them humping your way make sure they know about your arm so they will have medical with them im going to try to reach benson that explosion seemed awfully close to the communications department
252436 i hope this is important i have to report an explosion
252437 benson youre not dead i was sure that this attack was centered in or near communications
252438 several of the upper floors seem to have taken damage but im ok and i just talked to kenfer he sustained injury but rescue will have him safe soon and i think its time we all meet in a safe place to compare notes
252439 the bomb went off right after i received the raw probe information via currier that i had running thorough my filter program on non network personal comps the next step in the process will boil it down to the code needed to access the centers archives thats when well get the answers we want im doing this myself we cant trust or risk anyone else at this juncture
252440 ok get whatever you need even if you have to use the executive supply room
252441 ill check in with kenfer to see if hes been extricated from the lift yet and find out the extent of his injuries i want him to preside over our meeting are the friends you used as helpers safe im guessing the extra program help you needed involved them
252442 their office is only on the third floor and the damage appears to have been directed at the communications department on the eleventh floor but i will check in with them after this call
252443 yes this is the personal secretary to the centers directorate manager mr kenfer has advised me that it has become necessary to temporarily reactivate beta section in lab 21 two technicians have been assigned to the task and you are to assist them in any way possible is that clear mr monroe
252444 ill ready the section you need right away can you tell me when the techs will arrive there is also the matter of security codes for the control consoles who ever you send must have the codes before any power or computer connections can be made
252445 the technicians will arrive in two days to expedite matters i am sending the security codes to your hand com via encoded cipher my records show that you have the com issued to you when you took the posting at the laboratory that com will have the required program to decipher the codes for your use i want you to have the power and control feeds connected to the probe consoles by the time the techs arrive this will shave a day or two off the start up process once your help shows up we have a working line probe in trouble out there and time is of the essence
252446 no problem i have all the original schematics left by the last operations crew to run the machine and im already familiar with both theory and operations material i dont believe i caught your name and by the way its nice to feel needed this job has been a might lack luster so far for my taste
252447 the codes should be showing up on your hand com any second remember that this material and the activation of beta section is classified until further notice

252460 ok that took long enough i thought briefly that you might have been discovered and of no more use to me
252461 i have a job for you a guy in the centers communications department is researching some data sent to one of your probes its a black ops that you may or may not know about very hush hush his name is benson and he will have one or two compatriots helping him i need to know what he has discovered and who his helpers are the information that might be found cannot reach a guy named melman melman works for the centers directorate manager andrew kenfer
252462 ive run into this benson before his first name is corey and i also know where to look for anyone that might be helping him bensons a workaholic and doesnt have many friends if he has anyone working for him i can find out easily enough what kind of time frame are we working with
252463 i have a contract to stop this information from being presented in an ongoing inquiry
252464 my contract is nonspecific about how i accomplish this task but time is of the essence we will need to hurry i can destroy the information before its found i can corrupt the information which would be more palatable to those looking for it as accidental and therefore believable or i can eliminate those persons who are attempting to uncover it the last option is the least desirable but remains on the table with this in mind along with the name or names of bensons assistants i want their entire work schedules for the next forty eight hours
252465 the personnel involved will be the easy part but getting into the computer records for a black ops will require bribes do i have your permission to use the slush account as i have before
252466 yes do whatever you need to i will send the new access information for the slush account to your com when we end our call

252534 clearly some agencies do not have adequate funding to employ the number of foia officers needed
252535 it tends to confirm with real data what most foia users will have suspected already from their own experience
252536 that is that foia compliance is spotty and getting worse
252537 few agencies have a freaking clue about online marketing let alone how to promote a contest through social media
252538 estoy motivado de jugar con el tenista m s en forma del momento
252539 estoy muy contento por c mo he jugado esta semana contra ferrer me sent un poco mejor dentro de la cancha pero tambi n es por el estilo de juego de verdasco que hace que el partido sea m s irregular y con menos ritmo
252540 jugu un poco m s inteligente y saqu muy bien en los momentos importantes
252541 contra nadal va a ser un partido dif cil pero estos son los momentos por los que todav a juego tenis y que m s me motivan jugar en una cancha central contra el jugador m s en forma del momento

252547 i hope this is important im trying to catch up on my neglected in box
252548 i just received an encrypted message from a corey benson sent to your attention it seems this benson fellow has access to your private encryption protocol and the message has the standard emergency id tag attached do you want me to send it to your desk comp or to security for investigation
252549 by all means put the message into my private communiqu s ill decrypt it myself when i can and let security know if need be
252550 the hour is late and there has been a new development in the probe case if we all break for the day more light will be shed on our problem when we reconvene tomorrow
252551 i also think we all need a rest director kenfer and will divert to your good sense in this matter
252552 precisamos de us 30 bilh es para fechar o caixa esta noite
252553 uma coisa voc comprar uma casa a outra comprar uma casa em chamas
252554 naquela noite avaliamos que havia um risco de 30 de haver uma quebra sucessiva de bancos e outras institui es financeiras mesmo assim assumir este risco seria uma grande falta de responsabilidade tudo poderia acontecer
252555 no entanto h muita alavancagem liquidez e ambi es desmedidas mas wall street apenas reflete o que se passa na economia
252556 you know this is against my business policy i explained this clearly to you the first time you contracted to employ my services jeopardizing my position will now add to the price of our arrangement
252557 at this point your fee means nothing to me a new development has reared its ugly head and time has become a precious commodity
252558 your changed situation is not my concern you contracted me to intercept information on a particularly sensitive project and remove said information from records assessable to analysis by central records drones you said nothing of immediate pressures
252559 i just walked out of a briefing with the centers directorate manager and all of my council peers without explanation the whole group will be looking for an explanation for my rude behavior upon my return i wouldnt have placed myself in this position drawing unnecessary attention to myself i might add if this wasnt an emergency
252560 my calls are limited in time to prevent traces so please come to the point quickly my voice coms will terminate automatically if a trace is sensed
252561 directorate manager kenfer has more resources than i expected and i have underestimated his abilities this will not happen again no matter the cost it seems that kenfer has an assistant that has employed the skills of one of his friends in the communication section to successfully find by brilliant computer analysis that an operational immediate action code was sent to the very probe whose records you were hired to clear out this oia code and the data content contained therein simply must be intercepted and deleted or at least corrupted before the incriminating content is discovered
252562 mr loomis im sure that you have not forgotten the one nonnegotiable criterion that is part of my standard operating policy i am extremely carful when i obtain or in your case purge information for clients although i am sensitive to your dilemma and will proceed without delay i will not operate carelessly
252563 i have a name for you from my own center confidential informants
252564 the communications technician feeding critical information to kenfer through his personal assistant and close to uncovering the whole sordid business is corey benson this guy has apparently developed a rouge search program not part of centrals network grid my people have been watching for flags that would indicate benson is using the center data base or resource pool nothing has popped up yet and it is believed that he is using private equipment linked but isolated by a powerful firewall
252565 i will provide my usual professional services mr loomis without fail but be advised that your information will be considered only in a supportive role until i verify the information myself i have your personal com id code and you should have the translation matrix i provided you i will text you updates only no more voice communications understand that i am aware of your position and intend to live up to your trust in my expertise and judgment what i need you to do now is return to the meeting and provide a believable excuse for leaving in such a rush i will guarantee that your position is safe by beginning with our mr bensons activities
252566 probe what has happened you expressed to me that i needed a bit more training and our position would remain stationary until i satisfied your programming guidelines and earned your confidence
252567 youre telling me that something has occurred to change the reality of the local time line that when this incident happened the resulting change sent a ripple or bump through the continuum or whatever it is we are parked in that exists between the many and varied time lines of reality
252568 what type of mission i dont really know what would be appropriate
252569 what would you consider a change of any significance ive always wanted to kick myself when i was younger because i didnt do something that i always regretted not doing not earth shattering in any way but i do wish that i had purchased something i wasnt interested in at the time this item turned out to be rare after i became an adult and i always wished my choice had been different back then
252570 i have provided my location with an approximate time i assume adjustments can be made in the observation aspect of an investigation before insertion
252571 luoghi nei quali scambiare opinioni e idee mandare un saluto ad amici lontani raccontare di noi ad una persona cara attraverso immagini e foto
252572 per ogni cittadino la rete significa forme nuove di condivisione produzione critica trasmissione e diffusione dellinformazione qualcosa che ha a che fare con la libert la crescita dellopinione pubblica la qualit della nostra democrazia
252573 nel leggere della causa di mediaset contro youtube e google per prima cosa mi viene da pensare a quale idea di media sia giusto ispirarsi
252574 guardo a questa polemica come a un discrimine tra il vecchio e il nuovo mondo tra unidea chiusa e regressiva ed una aperta ed avanzata
252575 penso che possa nascere finalmente una televisione nuova in cui la condivisione e la partecipazione degli utenti di noi cittadini nella rete rompa gli schemi e riconquisti la creativit la libert lutilit alle potenzialit di questo mezzo straordinario
252576 prima di ricorrere alle vie legali abbiamo provato pi volte a contattare youtube e google per chiedere la rimozione del nostro materiale dal sito internet ed aprire una trattativa privata ma non abbiamo mai ricevuto risposta
252577 non siamo stati noi a menare le mani con la causa legale stato youtube a farlo commettendo un illecito ai nostri danni e piratando i nostri video in rete non tutto libero e gratuito youtube ha tratto un lucro commerciale da contenuti scippati ha usato materiale mediaset come base per banner pubblicitari e offerte commerciali ai propri utenti stiamo parlando di un colosso economico del web non di un blog spontaneistico dove i ragazzi si scambiano video amatoriali nessuno mette in dubbio il rimescolamento di carte che in corso nel mondo dei contenuti ma mediaset continua ad avere un profondo rispetto della propriet intellettuale e dellintero sistema di business che oggi in tutta la filiera produtttiva viene finanziato dai diritti dautore in futuro ci saranno nuovi sistemi e nuove forme di tutela della propriet intellettuale ma al momento non esiste alcuna alternativa chi ci ha dipinto come conservatori dovrebbe sapere che prima di scassare un modello di business che funziona servono nuove idee altrettanto valide in grado di reggere lintera macchina di produzione dellingegno anche youtube dovr adeguarsi
252578 il riconoscimento del nostro diritto a difendere il patrimonio video di mediaset la precondizione di qualsiasi trattativa
252579 pregiudicare seriamente la tempistica davvio della fase realizzativa del prossimo

252607 i just wanted to bring some sort of excitement back to music
252608 with each song i just took time to figure out how i would voice it to make it fit in a modern day context
252609 because these were 80s songs a lot of em had vocal effects that sound dated now real heavy reverbs and shit like that so i just had to sit back and play with different vocal styles to see how id make it work
252610 soooooooo he sends the joint back to me and it has the effect on it but the computer only recognizes key it doesnt recognize individual notes so that meant that me and khrysis had to go through and match every note to the right pitch of zos instrumental that shit took hours
252611 tay man i got this idea we should revisit the 80s
252612 im down to do it if youre down to do it

252639 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
252640 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
252641 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
252642 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
252643 the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
252644 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
252645 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
252646 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
252647 my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it so our relationship at the moment is always strong there is no doubt about that
252648 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
252649 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
252650 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
252651 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
252652 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
252653 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
252654 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
252655 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
252656 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
252657 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
252658 when you see something as horrifying as that the brain locks on to those images its very difficult to release those images
252659 the assistance that people will get will be along the lines of coping in the immediate phase learning what to do to reduce the profound effect this experience will have
252660 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
252661 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
252662 we are working with transport canada to review inter city bus security
252663 the canadian press is posting past incidents they had to go 8 yrs back to find 5 cases
252664 its the last chance to see heath and hes brilliant
252665 filming stopped for a bit until the three heroes as theyre now known law depp and farrell came to the rescue and finished off heaths part
252666 so you ended up with four actors playing one character
252667 study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
252668 now brethren concerning the coming of our lord jesus christ and our gathering together to him we ask you not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled either by spirit or by word or by letter as if from us as though the day of christ had come
252669 why did paul reassure the thessalonians in his letter that they had not missed the rapture
252670 let no one deceive you by any means for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first and the man of sin is revealed the son of perdition
252671 no they thought they where in the day of the lord the day of god
252672 why dont you just buy a mat that says welcome death eaters and put it out at your front door
252673 its this or hide out in some ministry safe house until the aurors round up every single death eater out there and we all know how prompt theyll be with that
252674 so theyll be here straight away if anyone if they come here
252675 and you really think this is the best course of action
252676 so what happens if these people show up in the middle of the night while youre sleeping or worse while youre away from the house what if you come home one day to find death eaters waiting for you
252677 and other spells jinxes well put up a warning system and then well trap them
252678 well if theres a chance to trap the people who are after harry wouldnt you want to take it
252679 if we dont deal with this now theyll always be out there i have a responsibility to end this
252680 fine but i dont think you should just sit around here all alone waiting for death eaters to come calling one of us should be with you all the time
252681 but i still think it would be er beneficial to have a witch or wizard with you too you know just in case
252682 yeah ive learned that im pretty much stuck with you lot
252683 ive got to be at the shop every now and again but ill try to stick around as much as possible
252684 i can get dad and percy to spend some time here too maybe even george but i doubt it
252685 i mean i spend all of my time in the wizarding world anyway right
252686 so well have to set up some security wards obviously fortunately weve all got quite good at those
252687 then some alarm charms perhaps some variation on the caterwauling charm only well have to somehow make it silent so that it alerts only us and the aurors
252688 do you think we can modify that one or is there a silent charm like that which already exists
252689 well have to work out some way to alert them if something happens but how
252690 it has to be subtle nothing that can be seen or overheard like a patronus
252691 you can use the same kind of enchantment on something for the aurors something normal so that no one can guess what they really are if we need the aurors we can send a message to them through those
252692 its just something that happened at home a few days ago
252693 my parents theyve been having difficulty with the after effects of the memory modification
252694 its difficult you know trying to explain to them what i can do what its like here in the wizarding world
252695 but dont they get that you sent them away for their own good
252696 mr peet claims that he didnt give up the location of arbour glen so that should slow the death eaters down
252697 the map the one you drew for me the first time i came when i had to sign that homeowners rubbish with you i i lost it remember
252698 we dont want to them to be able to just pop in and out now do we
252699 we dont get many people up here figured a red headed fellow walking up the road must be the same young man my grandson was going on about
252700 i uh ive really only talked to him once or twice
252701 yes well i think hes taken a liking to you its tough sometimes for my wife and i to keep up with him
252702 when my my son and daughter in law died were not young margaret and i and its difficult having to run a farm and trying to entertain a five year old at the same time
252703 anyway its nice that hes found a young man like you to talk to he said your friend lives up the road hes not trying to fix up that old disaster of a
252704 ive got to get back to my friends house just now
252705 can i grandpa ill be right back and i wont go into the forest i promise i promise for real this time
252706 youre not to go into rons friends house though is that understood
252707 good whats your friends name by the way the one who lives up the road
252708 right well tell harry to come by sometime and introduce himself
252709 we are not going to play hide and seek and i am not going to be it
252710 thats okay because you would have never found me anyway because i can turn invisible
252711 im right here you cant see me because im invisible
252712 you think these death eaters that youre luring here arent going to give two bloody sickles about them maybe theyll put them in a body bind and float them through the air for sport would that make you happy
252713 i didnt think of that right away but i did mention it to hermione while you were gone
252714 it was safe enough for the order of the phoenix
252715 look i met the old man today and ive talked to the kid a couple of times
252716 theyre nice people the kid is hes really little and hes a good kid and i would hate myself if something happened to him because of us all right
252717 its really complex and id have to read up on it but im sure i can do the charm
252718 canadas neo nazis white rights groups readying for racial war
252719 the levelling demands of a generous democratic inspiration have been changed from aspirations and ideals into appetites and unconscious assumptions
252720 strange to think of you strange now to hear your voices through the ether coming from a world so long since barred to us i miss you miss you even though you were opponents of mine and politically on the other side oh believe me finally it is the lack of all opposition and any dissension whatsoever and the deadly monotony that results that makes life here so unbearable
252721 it is only the sentimentalist who imagines that the profundity of a persons response to tragedy is proportional to the length volume or shrillness of his lamentation
252722 real freedom concrete freedom the freedom that can actually be defined claimed and granted was not the opposite of obedience but its other side the abstract unreal freedom of the liberal intellect was really nothing more than childish disobedience amplified into anarchy
252723 in toronto it appears one may leer desirously at underdressed girls or gape at them with the costive expression of one who considers nudity and art to be synonymous terms but one must not laugh
252724 before the newlyweds can be given the throne they must consummate their union

252729 every time we see our baby well see him with a different mom from a distance
252730 youre the love of my life and ill never let you go
252731 im glad you got what you wanted but we can never be happy i did what i did to keep my kid out of a lawsuit
252732 you dont want our baby and even if i try to raise our baby myself the mom wouldnt be around and i dont want our kid to grow up thinking he was a mistake
252733 how do i get myself into these messes and talking to a shih tzu in a bar i miss the good old days when i didnt have a conscience

253058 at every olympics there is one athlete who ends up inspiring the world with their courage and character were hoping that athlete is reading this
253059 olympic athletes have the platform and the power to inspire the world
253060 at the beijing games we believe athletes have the opportunity to inspire not only with their athletic performances but also by standing up for what is right by supporting human rights and freedom for tibet
253061 the chinese government is using the olympics as a pretext for an ongoing campaign of brutal repression targeting tibetans
253062 we are searching for an athlete to show the chinese government the true olympic principles of friendship solidarity and fair play by standing up for tibet at the beijing olympics
253063 at a time when chinese authorities are ruthlessly silencing tibetan voices it means more than ever when free people speak up for tibet
253064 we believe many athletes compete in the olympics not just for themselves and their countries but because they believe in the values of liberty justice and human dignity that the olympics represent these are the ideals that tibetans are struggling and dying for at this moment
253065 comrades we express our deep thanks to all our friends around the world and to the ioc for helping to make beijing successful in its olympic bid
253066 i hope the whole nation works hard along with residents of the capital city to stage successful 2008 olympic games i also welcome our friends around the world to visit beijing in 2008
253067 for the industrial and commercial sector its like buying an insurance policy that china will not invade taiwan for seven years
253068 we deeply regret that beijing is awarded the 2008 olympic games
253069 this will put the stamp of international approval on beijings human rights abuses and will encourage china to escalate its repression
253070 the president believes that the olympics are a sporting event not a political event but having said that this now is an opportunity for china to showcase itself as a modern nation
253071 the decision by the ioc goes towards justifying a repressive political system that each day flouts freedom and violates human rights
253072 following the example of nazi germany in 1936 and the soviet union in 1980 communist china will use the games as a powerful propaganda instrument destined to consolidate its hold on power
253073 i am convinced that the olympic games will have a positive effect on chinas democratic development

253103 the lord god hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men to declare these things to every kindred nation and tongue that thereby whosoever should believe in christ the same might receive remission of their sins and rejoice with exceedingly great joy
253104 consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of god for behold they are blessed in all things both temporal and spiritual and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven that thereby they may dwell with god in a state of never ending happiness
253105 a person does not have to spend much time in the schoolroom of mortality to realize that heavenly fathers plan does not provide for blissful happiness at every step along our mortal journey life is filled with harsh realities that tug at the heart and tear away at the soul
253106 there is nothing sad or gloomy about a person who accepts the truths of the gospel and incorporates these principles in his daily living god wants all of his children to be joyous and glad and we can have this blessing if we are willing to keep his commandments and live by his word in all that we do
253107 if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them

253111 contra rivales m s fuertes siempre tienes la ventaja de que los jugadores est n totalmente metidos en el partido
253112 transmitir que dependemos de nosotros y que debemos hacer las cosas bien
253113 es por el tema del c sped se est poniendo nuevo y con m s tiempo podr a arraigarse m s
253114 la verdad es que la siguiente semana para nosotros es vital empezando ma ana despu s con el partido del mi rcoles ante san luis y recibimos en casa a tecos la meta es obtener los 9 puntos para hacer el viaje a espa a con tranquilidad pero tenemos que ir paso a paso y pensar primero en el atlas que va a ser un rival muy complicado
253115 sin duda hay que mejorar la t ctica fija porque en las jugadas a bal n parado nos hicieron da o en la fecha uno la verdad es que en el primer tiempo guadalajara no se hab a acercado a nuestra porter a y eso fue lo que nos cost el gol en contra antes de irnos al descanso
253116 aumentar la presi n al rival porque en el segundo gol que nos hicieron el jugador que dio el pase jonny magall n tuvo mucho tiempo para elegir la jugada esas son las situaciones que hemos analizado y que tenemos que corregir pensando en el juego de ma ana
253117 sin duda que hacer cinco goles en el futbol actual es complicado aunque me parece que hay que analizar las situaciones jaguares es un equipo que tuvo muchas ausencias y sufri en este juego de una expulsi n adolfo bautista pero no hay que demeritar los que hizo atlas despleg un futbol agresivo y din mico y tenemos que ser conscientes de ello
253118 first warning gold doubles as the greenspan fed makes real interest rates negative for the first time in 25 years now his successor is at it again
253119 its getting increasingly evident that this is a once in a century type of phenomenon
253120 not the standard type of liquidity crisis that we have seen in the past
253121 its still very evident from inter bank lending spreads that we have not gotten closure yet
253122 its essentially fundamentally the price of homes in the united states which are determining the ultimate collateral of mortgage backed bonds pretty much around the world
253123 were still nowhere near the bottom of the home price thing
253124 ultra expansionary us monetary policies with artificially low interest rates led to bubbles all over the world and in every imaginable asset class the price of gold more than doubled in nominal terms and against the dow jones industrial average
253125 central banks of necessity determine what the money supply is
253126 if you are on a gold standard or other mechanism in which the central banks do not have discretion then the system works automatically
253127 the reason there is now very little support for the gold standard is the consequences of those types of market adju stments are not considered to be appropriate in the 20th and 21st century i am one of the rare people who have still some nostalgic view about the old gold standard as you know but i must tell you i am in a very small minority among my colleagues on that issue

253181 we have veto threats on these bills almost every year
253182 this is the meat of our legislative responsibility here in congress
253183 they have shut down the process based entirely on their fear that we would get a vote on energy issues
253184 the democratic leaderhip clearly knows that they are defying the will of the american people by not allowing a vote on increasing the supply of american energy to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices

253190 some people have dismissed the cold boot attack as a minor issue but thats not true to pull off the attack all you have to do is literally stick a usb into the laptop you get your hands on
253191 it doesnt require any technical skill you can easily get automated tools to perform the attack for you
253192 and all the information on those machines is vulnerable to cold boot attacks
253193 so if someone grabs the device they cant access anything
253194 this uses advanced techniques that take advantage of how memory works in hardware
253195 since cold boot attacks can boot an alternative operating system to which they dump the contents of the memory to sift through it for keys we make sure the keys are erased before the os is booted
253196 we can detect when people try to cool down the machine so they can keep the memory from fading and the method destroys the keys and shuts down the computer
253197 its a virtual protected area for keys to be used in a system so cold boot is not able to access any of the keys for encryption
253198 its as if we created a virtual piece of hardware where the keys would be stored and utilized

253213 this means journalists athletes families and other visitors will be subjected to invasive intelligence gathering by the chinese public security bureau
253214 ndr sorride per conto mio quella era una maglia da ritirare ma farlo non nella tradizione della societ per stato molto simpatico quello che ha detto muntari di recoba vuole dire che muntari ha seguito le vicende dellinter anche precedentemente quindi entrato nel club dalla porta principale
253215 non da noi che lo avevamo nel mirino da tempo forse lo stato un po mediaticamente forse anche perch arrivato in fretta ed entrato subito a lavorare e perch sino al giorno prima si parlava di lampard mourinho invece ne ha parlato in termini talmente entusiastici sin da quando lo abbiamo preso in considerazione
253216 laltra sera a torino mi sembrato che sotto un certo aspetto la squadra avesse il solito potenziale spaventoso e questa cosa ti d pi forza sia come tifoso che come responsabile della societ poi apparso chiaro che a differenza degli altri siamo ancora in costruzione il milan ha una particolarit nonostante abbiano solo dieci giorni di lavoro nelle gambe ha dei meccanismi che funzionano perfettamente alla stessa velocit la juventus ha un mese di preparazione alle spalle questo sicuramente un vantaggio noi invece abbiamo fatto due cambiamenti insieme e oltre ai nuovi metodi di lavoro cera la poca preparazione il tutto porta a una crescita speriamo veloce che comunque deve avere i suoi tempi per dare lespressione migliore la squadra non mi ha fatto per nulla una cattiva impressione davvero niente male sia sotto il punto di vistasingolo che per di certi movimenti dinsieme
253217 uno si crea laspettativa perch personaggio laspettativa la stessa che ci sarebbe in un altro paese nel quale andasse ad allenare lui una persona cos e questa aspettativa esagerata nasce dal fatto che un allenatore di qualit e poi perch arriva dopo un allenatore che ha fatto molto bene e come tale una sfida che ha voluto cogliere non una cosa da tutti
253218 la champions league un obiettivo molto importante per noi io credo che questo sia un progetto quindi aspettiamo i risultati che vengono a seconda della qualit della squadra e il matrimonio tra lui e la squadra limpatto mediatico molto buono lui molto bravo e sincero anche nellesprimersi e poi tutti vedremo i passi che pu fare a volte le critiche posso essere utilissime per lui litalia un ambiente nuovo per mi sembra ci sia molto rispetto per mourinho
253219 non credo sono talmente tanti anni che non assolutamente unossessione unopportunit una festa che una volta vinta pu diventare naturale mi ricordo dopo la vittoria sul real che fu tutto fantastico dopo la seconda vittoria i giornali scrissero che era migliore la prima la prima sempre la pi bella quindi aspettiamola
253220 si un cantiere con tutti gli operai che sanno gi cosa devono fare che hanno gi costruito un paio di grattacieli anche tre non mi preoccuperei pi di tanto
253221 et avanzata non mi pare perch c bisogno di esperienza preoccupano solo gli infortuni speriamo che guariscano nei tempi giusti quelli sui quali puntiamo per non siamo pessimisti
253222 lho conosciuto a met aprile dopo quella situazione capitata con mancini per anche prima avevo simpatia per lui per qualcuno qualche atteggiamento pu sembrare antipatico e rude per qualcun altro una sfida per valorizzare il lavoro suo e della squadra lo vedevo come uno che difende i giocatori con il chelsea mi aveva colpito questo suo atteggiamento certo che in un ambiente difficile come litalia se la sta cavando bene mediaticamente adesso deve cavarsela bene anche calcisticamente la sua qualit migliore la capacit di sintesi mi piace moltissimo una velocit nel capire e trasmettere le cose con frasi tra il serissimo e lironico ha una una grandissima capacit di sintesi e sa darti un quadro veloce della situazione positivo perch non perdi tempo e sai di poterti fidare della persona per i suoi giudizi
253223 mi sembra che lo stesso mourinho abbia giustamente osservato che herrera ha vinto tutto con linter mentre lui ancora nulla ma naturale questo paragone ci sono cose simili per ora caratteriali di esposizione mediatica di un certo atteggiamento di sfida e una grandissima tempra lavorativa questultima la cosa che pi accomuna i due personaggi di tutti quelli che ho conosciuto quello che si avvicina di pi a herrera
253224 si deve vincere ancora per gestire la supremazia non avendo molti agganci giusti bisogna soltanto giocare bene e vincere
253225 il milan credo che questanno abbia soprattutto la fiducia la roma fortissima deve ripetere il campianato dellanno scorso che stato eccezionale la juventus ha grande carattere per in questo momento il milan in vantaggio perch si conoscono tutti bene
253226 ndr sorride un po meno di una volta il fatto che adesso sia del milan mi intriga molto poco
253227 messi mi era piaciuto quando era un ragazzo si vedeva che sarebbe esploso il suo pallino il pallino di tutti non solo mio un giocatore di classe notevole lo porterebbe allinter ora ho una tale stima calcistica per ibrahimovic che non mi fa venir voglia di andare a cercare il giocatore di grande fantasia perch la vedo gi molto concentrata in zlatan per questo che sono un po meno attratto magari poi scommetterei su un giovanissimo che non ancora esploso non su uno che gi venuto fuori
253228 no lho trovato molto serio so certamente che volesse andare via ma lo faceva con molta ansiet e non riuscito a creare quella rottura che si aspettavano loro e conoscevamo anche noi motivi per cause familiari per suo padre che molto legato al suo ambiente lo stesso mourinho pensava che sarebbe stato molto difficile che lampard andasse via da londra quindi abbiamo pensato a un giocatore che per et e ingaggio potesse essere comunque molto buono mi va bene sia arrivato muntari
253229 s siamo in fase di studio e stiamo ancora considerando se sia proprio necessario
253230 non lo so proprio per il rapporto con mancini bisogna distinguere il presidente dellinter da massimo moratti moratti affezionato a mancini cio a qualcuno che ha fatto bene e che ha sofferto con lui moratti presidente deve valutare il danno che una societ pu subire in certi momenti e purtroppo questo danno ha un suo peso se lo incontro per sono massimo moratti
253231 cerco di fare in modo che la squadra possa vincere e dare soddisfazioni ai tifosi sono loro che devono sognare io spero solo che la squadra vinca ancora per tanto tempo
253232 c affetto e riconoscenza nei confronti dei giocatori la cosa che ti dispiace di pi che hai riconoscenza e a volte devi fare comunque una cosa del genere

253234 my young fellows if you will enlist a guinea you quickly will have in your fist besides a crown for to kick up the dust and drink the kings health in the morning for a soldier he leads a very fine life he always is blessed with a charming young wife and he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and always lives happy and charming and a soldier he always is decent and clean in the finest of garments hes constantly seen while other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning
253235 i wouldnt be proud of your clothes for youve only the lend of them as i suppose and you dare not change them one night or you know if you do youll be flogged in the morning and although we are single and free we take great delight in our own company and we have no desire strange countries to see although that your offer is charming and we have no desire to take your advance all hazards and danger we barter on chance and youd have no scruples to send us to france where we would be shot without warning
253236 if i hear but one word i instantly now will out with my sword and into your bodies as strength will afford so now my gay devils take warning
253237 again and again hillels questions are heard simultaneously not sequentially if i am not for myself who will be for me and if i am only for myself what am i others may find contradiction here we find enduring and productive tension
253238 theres a dynamic here worth attending to where the left has closed the door to israel gone beyond tough criticism all the way to demonization we are left out in the cold we will have no truck with exclusivists whether of the right or the left but while we cannot do not will not dance with those who believe that pro zionist passion requires the suspension of critical judgment we prefer the company of those who wish israel well to the company of those who wish it ill even though the course endorsed by those who wish it well seems to us too often mistaken

253241 the way things are structured right now all of those costs to finance the boats are going to get passed through to the customers unless the government recognizes that infrastructure for the ferries is similar to infrastructure for the highways
253242 i think its getting to the point where bc ferries is shooting themselves in the foot
253243 prices are high enough that people arent using them and bc ferries are going to lose their revenues and then theyre going to start cutting trips which is just a downward spiral
253244 my better half has a store here which is also affected by ferry fares
253245 tourism is definitely down its affected all the retailers on saltspring
253246 normally in the summer when youre driving into ganges harbour the islands commercial hub there are cars parked almost to the top of the hill

253248 well see what the doctors have to say when they actually want him to go he said

253377 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
253378 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
253379 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
253380 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
253381 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service
253382 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
253383 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
253384 i agree that we do have jurisdiction in general over these areas however we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce
253385 tonight the vietnamese team had a good match the weather tonight was nice and i liked this match very much
253386 im happy with the match although we had little training we would like to thank vietnamese fans and the hosts for giving us a warm welcome and good preparation
253387 having the brazilian players in vietnam is a once in a lifetime event
253388 its a great opportunity to see ronaldinho pato and anderson
253389 its unbelievable to see them playing football in vietnam the vietnamese are like the brazilians in their love for soccer
253390 im very surprised about the warm welcome and the enthusiasm from the vietnamese fans for soccer i will have a lot of things to tell my friends back home
253391 there are many young players who have a lot of experience and i think that will make the difference for us
253392 we have let many chances of gold slip many good teams have played the olympics and we have never managed to win it now we have the opportunity we have a very good team

253395 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
253396 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
253397 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
253398 completely false story put out by karadzic after he disappeared from public life and he was trying to justify himself its laughable

253406 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
253407 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
253408 a 15 year study of 9 000 people found that during that time people who married and stayed married built up nearly twice the net worth of people who stayed single even when all other factors are held constant stuff like income and education just the fact that they were married contributed to a 4 annual rise in these couples wealth
253409 i think people who choose to get married are more likely to be people who choose to do other socially traditional responsible things like buy a house and contribute to retirement funds
253410 you cant control market risks but you can control costs
253411 there are tons of things in your home and life that you dont use need or even particularly want they just come into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam and never found a good exit whether youre aware of it or not this clutter creates indecision and distractions consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore it is impossible to realize how distracting all the crap is whether porcelain dolls sports cars or ragged t shirts until you get rid of it

253446 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
253447 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
253448 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
253449 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone

253453 b ut he is not a conservative he is conservative on some things but he has not led a movement as reagan did every day of his career bushs unpopularity is due primarily to his reluctance to publicly defend himself and his administration against attacks from the left

253455 i dont know how long i remained parked in front of that wall of womens magazines
253456 motionless and mesmerized in an overly lit bookstore listening to the rhythmic flip flap of pages being turned the sensation was similar to being in a las vegas casino where there are no windows or clocks and you could be playing blackjack for either ten minutes or ten years

253458 partly because the thrill was gone what had once been a guilty pleasure taken at nail and hair salons had since become a full time job i was not only reading fourteen magazines a month i was actively participating in their content checking in with faceless writers and editors at all times and constantly analyzing the results it was an exhausting way to live out a life however successful the end result

253463 we just really need the time and were going to take that time and well talk to you in the fall
253464 still on a great track but we gotta get it back on its almost perfect track
253465 our focus on information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure is paying off and is the driving force behind our strong financial position our successful business model and our competitive advantage
253466 we do not believe that revenue misses at vmw has much to do with competition from
253467 going to 6g sas is the next natural evolutionary step for sas
253468 while parallel scsi was limited to das environments sas brings new features that are opening up the possibility of sas in san like deployments which you might call scalable sharable das
253469 such architectures are already being shipped in some blade systems today
253470 further enhancements in 6gb s sas will make it even more attractive as a host interface for external storage moving forward
253471 this includes a standardized zoning scheme and the removal of limitations in sas configurations
253472 zoning may be used to hide disks or volumes from servers or computers that are not deliberately given access
253473 this is a security feature and is similar to the fibre channel
253474 6gb s sas should also be able to quickly replace parallel scsi as the preferred host attachment protocol for das
253475 with the speed price and feature set offered by 6gb s sas this technology will become an attractive alternative to fc
253476 3gb s sas is just now beginning to penetrate the host or front end interface of external raid subsystems in the lower price bands
253477 i fully expect sas to continue to grow as both the host and drive interfaces of external storage
253478 were good within the data center walls but not beyond
253479 thats where foundry comes in on the other side of the server
253480 cisco offers the same thing outside the data center and now so do we
253481 we believe the industry is at an inflection point in the way enterprise and service provider networks and data centers are being architected
253482 customers are demanding networking solutions that meet the needs for today and can address the many advances in network convergence that are still ahead brocade has taken an important step through this acquisition in developing a networking infrastructure strategy that will serve as the foundation for capitalizing on these dynamic opportunities
253483 the only players who can provide end to end lan to san data networking
253484 to make sense strategically in the long run you need to assume wide scale adoption of converged lan san networks
253485 we believe data center consolidation will continue to be a key initiative for end users though go to market and it organizational charts could slow the pace of adoption in the near term we believe brcd and fdry will market the new entity as a more broadly diversified strategic partner and one that is easier to deal with than cisco
253486 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
253487 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
253488 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party
253489 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
253490 your exhibits show that there are some farmers in lower gweru and chiundura areas who produced more than enough for their families and the local community however let me be quick to point out that there are hungry sharks who are currently hunting for your produce some of them are even trying to entice you by using foreign currency so that you are tempted to sell all your grain and if you do that your families will remain starving
253491 a fully mechanised farmer a pillar to improved agricultural production
253492 we need to improve in the manner we distribute these implements each ward should have at least a tractor or two so those beneficiaries can assist their counterparts farm mechanisation is a good programme but it needs to improved to allow productive and deserving farmers to benefit
253493 i invited reserve bank of zimbabwe governor dr gideon gono to officially open the provincial agricultural show on saturday so that he may speak on farm mechanisation a programme sponsored by the central bank
253494 fuel is expensive government is losing a lot of forex on fuel importation if we all grow jatropha we will alleviate the fuel problem and save foreign currency
253495 the current trend of seasons has rudely reminded us of our traditional crops such as millet sorghum and rapoko let us increase hectarage of such small grains because they produce better yields for us during bad seasons they also have less disease and pest problems after all science has proved that traditional foods make up a very healthy diet
253496 the applicant mushore elected to delay the finalisation of the matter by absconding to england
253497 the specification order should not be revoked until the investigations are completed and a decision on the outcome of the investigations has been made
253498 the final report in the matter has not yet been prepared as investigations are still in progress
253499 if the dollar continues to strengthen and the political situation regarding iran improves then the long term prices will be about 78
253500 go back and look for those coins we never demonetised them
253501 we once again wish to call upon stakeholders to exercise restraint in their demand for cash and in how prices are set in the goods and services markets
253502 the current reform efforts will therefore work to sustain permanency of the new currency being rolled out along with the conveniences it will bring
253503 this will enable them to put their industry to full production and enable them to meet the fertilizer requirements that we need
253504 a moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
253505 no financial institution shall impose any fee commission or other charge whatsoever in respect of the conversion from the old currency system to the new in terms of subsection 9 or 10
253506 but inflation has not come down it has instead risen to a record 2 2 million percent at the end of june dr gono said the only answer to curbing inflation was increased production especially in agriculture
253507 http www govtrack us congress billtext xpd bill s107 494
253508 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and the final decision is in the best interest of the program
253509 it was a stable currency compared to the zimbabwe dollar
253510 we now prefer cash up front because medical aid societies take their time to pay yet inflation would be skyrocketing
253511 we also need to cushion ourselves against the prevailing economic situation
253512 a cash transaction at the point of sale is now the recommended mode of payment
253513 the reserve bank of zimbabwe wishes to advise that appropriate measures are being put in place to address the current setbacks being faced on the currency front as well as on financial and accounting systems
253514 accordingly therefore the next few days will see the reserve bank unveiling measures that would address concerns on the current minimum cash withdrawal limits as well as with the it systems digit handling constraints
253515 how about crossing your sex wires with some internet wires and give the whole internet dating a chance
253516 the main objective of this additional monetary policy tools is to control the rate of inflation in the country that has been rising of late
253517 the money the banks are giving out is not enough i borrowed z 500 billion so that my two children can get transport fare to and from school and food for the coming three days but with what the banks are giving out i will have to queue here for five days before i pay back the amount
253518 what is further irritating me is that i will have to find another excuse to give to my boss for me to come and queue at the bank again
253519 if i do not collect the money instantly i am afraid it will lose value and the more time i will take in withdrawing it
253520 i re sell bricks that i buy cheaply as a staff member at my workplace and with the extra that i make i get ready cash that augments my salary
253521 the supermarkets charge a commission and a fee if one wants to write a cheque for them just yesterday i signed a cheque for z 400 billion and i received z 300 billion in cash
253522 the withdrawal limits are ridiculous so the cash i make i sell to people who pay me in cheques
253523 the central bank is in the process of reviewing daily cash withdrawal limits following numerous representations from the public
253524 i would say the new bearers notes will come next month august
253525 the introduction of higher denominations of bearers cheques is an interim measure by the governor to ensure that cash shortages which the country experienced between november last year and february this year do not recur
253526 as long as inflation remains high cash shortages will persist there is need to address inflation by increasing production so that a few goods do not cost a lot of money
253527 due to the current cash shortages that we are experiencing coupled with the continuous increase in prices the demand for money will continue to increase and a number of agents will prefer to keep their money out of the formal system
253528 increasing inflation upward interest rates and a strong shilling against the dollar characterised the period under review despite an increase in foreign inflows as investors fled from the tumbling the dollar to other jurisdictions there was need for concern as the price of oil surged on causing local inflation to rise to three year highs
253529 weve got ample evidence here that science fiction is alive well and kicking ass
253530 i am now selling firewood in south african rand largely because of galloping inflation
253531 you will realise that most of our goods are imported from south africa and therefore you will find that of late we have been increasing the prices almost everyday
253532 this is largely because we would be racing against the prevailing exchange rate to enable ourselves to purchase more supplies
253533 in essence it seems the use of foreign currency in beitbridge whenever conducting any business has been legalised and right now you will note that some landlords who only recently feared arrest for charging rent in foreign currency are now openly boasting about it and are not being arrested for that matter
253534 the intention of the cbn to contract the minting of the naira its distribution and the destruction of bad notes as contained in page 25 of the federal tender journal on the 7th of july will have negative effects on the processing printing distribution and circulation of the nigerian currency
253535 some foreign banks have engaged in the outsourcing of their currencies which resulted in poor quality of production counterfeiting fraud insecurity and poor management of the distribution of currencies
253536 it is supposed to be a free trade zone but the federal government has not provided an operational guideline needed for it to start off and is not honouring their obligation to make it a free trade zone

253547 for the reporting quarter the total public debt stood at about us 5 228 4 million mainly due to interest accumulation the external component of the public debt totaled us 4 571 3 million while the domestic debt stood at us 657 1 million during the quarter the imf announced that it had paid liberias arrears of sdr 543 0 million an equivalent of us 890 0 million it further announced that liberia had reached a decision point at which it can benefit from interim debt relief under the enhanced heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative
253548 additionally aggregate capital of the banking system exceeded the required minimum measured by the capital adequacy ration car of 8 0 percent however the car declined by 3 0 percentage points from 28 0 percent in the previous quarter to 25 0 percent during the reporting quarter
253549 we will hold an emergency meeting where we will engage the business community on pricing structures and warn them for the last time
253550 players in the economic sector charging exorbitant prices would be arrested enmass
253551 we will apply to courts to have trading licenses of those charging extortionist prices cancelled
253552 price monitoring would extend to everything in the economic sector not just basic commodities

253565 we hope administration efforts working with the congress will help our fellow citizens close a painful chapter in their lives
253566 the united states also looks forward to expanding its relationship with libya and its people as we resolve contentious issues from the past
253567 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
253568 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
253569 i believe we are now on the way to getting there

253573 the only strategy capable of defeating the ultra right is the widest possible unity of all the class and social forces whose interests run counter to those of the most reactionary section of the transnationals such an all inclusive coalition would need to be led by labor and the working class in close alliance with the nationally and racially oppressed women and youth it should include seniors family farmers the lgbt community professionals and the self employed small business owners and the disabled everyone except the most reactionary section of transnational capital this unity will include an ever growing left center political coalition that includes the democratic party left and progressive independents who recognize the danger the ultra right poses and all social movements on the major issues of our day this front should strive to and be able to attract many who voted republican in the past
253574 the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways the point however is to change it
253575 the difference between a liberal and conservative is the liberal wants to make rich people poor and the conservative wants to make poor people rich therein lies the crux of the conflict in ideologies
253576 i have a big living room and i have this 14 foot by 14 foot couch
253577 it is a huge couch and i filled pretty much the whole room with it it is the hang out spot it is comfy and people can make a mess in the room

253582 it is an additional option to allow us to keep kids in the educational classroom
253583 i dont think that jumpsuits are going to work because my friends actually instead of it being a punishment theyll see it as an opportunity to be like rebels
253584 i dont think theres going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school
253585 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
253586 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety
253587 the jumpsuits may be just as distracting as the clothing theyre replacing

253614 starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on mr obama that republican operatives ran against harold ford
253615 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
253616 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue

253650 these dice are entirely different than what exists today in stores across the world
253651 most of whats out there is cheap and unappealing so we sought to upgrade the standard that people have for their novelty merchandise its well known that the trend among adult stores is to offer better quality products in a cleaner and more visually appealing retail environment it would be foolish for these retailers to try and sell cheap looking novelties and bachelorette supplies when their store is filled with expensive sex toys and elegantly designed lingerie
253652 hey i was the first adult star to enter the legal brothel business
253653 in doing so i opened the door for lots of other adult performers what i loved about working at the brothels was the ability to literally connect with my fans to get intimate with them to show them were not just fakers

253787 issue advocacy conveys information and educates an issue ads impact on an election if it exists at all will come only after the voters hear the information and choose uninvited by the ad to factor it into their voting decisions
253788 issue advocacy cannot be regulated by the fec and groups that engage in it cannot constitutionally be required to register as federal pacs
253789 the fecs enforcement actions arising out of the 2004 election were outrageously unconstitutional and we hope that this lawsuit will to put a stop to a repeat in 2008
253790 instead the fec plans to use its complicated pac enforcement policy developed in 2004 to punish groups for engaging in issue advocacy
253791 this is unconstitutional and we hope the federal courts will put an end to it
253792 the fec pursued these organizations claiming that they should have registered with the fec as a federal pac and be subject to all their issues and restrictions
253793 they were able to coerce many of these organizations into paying heavy fines
253794 rather than risk an enforcement action they have decided to bring suit so they can get a federal injunction
253795 anything that they would do to pursue even funding for this project would be illegal under the fecs unconstitutional enforcement policy
253796 they dont want to be violating any law they chose to go to court to determine whether the fecs rules are lawful or not
253797 obama voted for or against this bill hes in favor of partial birth abortion hes in favor of federally funding for abortion in the united states thats just talking about an issue

253802 i do a great deal of analysis of sen barack obamas autobiography
253803 obama first presents his father as a great hero and the truth was his father was a polygamist and a alcoholic
253804 i do a great deal of analysis of sen barack obamas autobiography
253805 obama first presents his father as a great hero and the truth was his father was a polygamist and a alcoholic he had abandoned the family in africa when he met obamas mother in hawaii he married obamas mother without disclosing that he had not divorced this african woman
253806 im first criticizing that obama was not straightforward in how he presented really a deception about his father as a goatherd who got his chance to go to come and study in the united states because of john kennedy
253807 it wasnt your fathers fault that he left you know i divorced him when the two of us got married your grandparents werent happy with the idea but they said okay they probably couldnt have stopped us anyway and they eventually came around to the idea that it was the right thing to do then baracks father your grandfather hussein wrote gramps this long nasty letter saying that he didnt approve of the marriage he didnt want the obama blood sullied by a white woman he said well you can imagine how gramps reacted to that and then there was a problem with your fathers first wife he had told me they were separated but it was a village wedding so there was no legal document that could show a divorce
253808 the old man began to drink heavily and many of the people he knew stopped coming to visit because now it was dangerous to be seen with him they told him that maybe if he apologized changed his attitude he would be all right but he refused and continued to say whatever was on his mind
253809 i understood most of this only when i was older
253810 she left when i was twelve or thirteen after the old man had had a serious car accident
253811 because of the accident the old man had now lost his job at the water department and we had no place to live
253812 it was worse between him and roy they would have terrific fights finally roy just left he just stopped coming home and started living with different people so i was left alone with the old man sometimes i would stay up half the night waiting to hear him come through the door worrying that something terrible had happened then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat

253825 we dont want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels and another set for those whose collars are white and have ivy league diplomas
253826 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
253827 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear
253828 every instinct i have in every aspect of life be it something to wear something to eat its all been wrong

253850 gegen ber unseren mitstreitern ist es weiter ein kleines budget aber wir konnten damit dennoch expandieren uns verbessern und einige neue leute an bord holen und damit werden wir f r das n chste jahr auch weitermachen
253851 wir haben von spyker und midland einen r ckstand bernommen und auch wenn wir aufholen so ist die formel 1 so umk mpft wie nie

253879 he is not supposed to be with kate and raising a child
253880 americas initial response to the post 9 11 political environment
253881 the bush administrations debate over whether or not to maintain the values of the american experiment established by the founding fathers
253882 the rise of an influential faction within the bush administration which included vice president cheney and neoconservatives that was comfortable with a hostile political landscape and eager to advance its agenda
253883 americas interactions with the international community and americas unusual position in the world
253884 nations that had good diplomatic relations with the us after 9 11
253885 he is a symbol of the consumate political animal someone who knows how to play the game and plays to win cheney as a man may be mortal but what he represents has always been with mankind and probably always will be
253886 dont leave your political tent and start picking up other ideologies
253887 i think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal i dont want some mum whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf i feel i owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as i can with them
253888 given the serious threats against us right now maybe what were doing here is sending out the wrong signal

253912 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
253913 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
253914 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
253915 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
253916 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
253917 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
253918 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
253919 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
253920 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
253921 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
253922 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
253923 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
253924 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
253925 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
253926 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
253927 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas

253936 elkhart and the surrounding area have a long history of innovation and routinely produce more patents per capita than any other region in the state
253937 by linking the innovations from the region with companies who can transform the technologies into jobs we will strengthen and further diversify the regions economy
253938 an economic development strategy in todays world would not be complete unless it includes innovation new ideas and new business ventures
253939 proactively identifying opportunities to link companies and researchers together to develop new innovations will increase the technical base of our region
253940 this program encourages communities to think plan and act regionally
253941 we know that when companies make expansion decisions they consider the regional assets including the regional workforce infrastructure and cultural amenities therefore it is essential that each region clearly understand and market their regional strengths when going after new economic development opportunities

253948 men who attend college are more likely to commit property crimes during their college years than their non college attending peers according to research to be presented at the annual meeting of the in boston this weekend
253949 the reason appears to be that kids who dont go to college simply have to grow up more quickly college enrollment allows for a lifestyle that essentially extends the adolescent period said patrick m seffrin the studys primary investigator and a graduate student and research assistant in the department of sociology and the center for family and demographic research at

253954 the trend is being set largely by community colleges with their propensity for nontraditional students who need an easier more flexible way to earn degrees the number of students taking online classes in washington has jumped 75 percent in just four years
253955 a report published in 2007 by the sloan consortium an online education association based at babson college in massachusetts found that online enrollment across the country is growing at a rate that vastly exceeds general student growth rates the survey found that almost 3 5 million students were taking at least one online course during the fall of 2006
253956 two year schools account for more than half of online enrollment but students are also enrolling at online universities such as the capella university both of which are for profit schools and many traditional universities are upping the ante with online courses especially in

253959 despite the lure of these technologies many college officials have decided to wait to test them on their students noting the cost furthermore officials say its unclear what requirements the education department would impose on institutions to comply with the proposed law

253964 it is becoming increasingly hard for americans to find work in this economy
253965 as the construction manufacturing and now retail sectors are reeling from job losses too many workers are being forced to reduce their hours and take part time jobs just to make ends meet
253966 i think were going to see more of the same for at least another quarter and it could be the rest of the year
253967 its good to have the government adding jobs in the short term but thats not an long term solution either
253968 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans not boost the profits of oil companies
253969 its time to restore fairness and balance to our economy and we can start by passing the emergency economic plan that im proposing today
253970 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around

253972 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
253973 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
253974 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
253975 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

253978 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
253979 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
253980 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
253981 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
253982 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
253983 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
253984 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
253985 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
253986 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed

254009 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important

254016 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves this practice seems to be fraught with conflicts of interest
254017 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of health care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
254018 many doctors learn about new drugs from drug company salespersons who may not be objective
254019 studies confirm that when unbiased health professionals armed with educational materials provide guidance to doctors they are more likely to purchase the best drug for the patient instead of the best deal for the pharmaceutical company
254020 this legislation a cost effective common sense and practical solution to a serious problem it is exactly the kind of support the federal government should be providing the states
254021 im proud to note that pennsylvania has one of the best and most innovative academic detailing programs in the country with documented and measurable cost savings
254022 for far too long most of the information physicians receive to make prescribing decisions has come from the drug companies marketing reps not independent experts this important legislation will go a long way toward giving doctors another less biased perspective
254023 providing doctors with objective information about prescription drugs allows them to prescribe the most effective treatment to their patients
254024 through this legislation medical professionals will have the option of hearing independent and scientific opinions on a wider range of drugs devices and medical interventions which also has a proven record of lowering health care costs
254025 we need a program like this to counter the pharmaceutical industrys marketing free for all
254026 academic detailing programs already exist in other countries and in several states and theyve been shown to improve care and generate savings
254027 as long time proponents of comparative effectiveness research the blue cross and blue shield association supports this legislation and its goal of making sure doctors have access to objective information about the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs
254028 providing doctors with information based on independent clinical research will help patients get the best treatment and improve safety and affordability of healthcare for everyone

254033 the way things are structured right now all of those costs to finance the boats are going to get passed through to the customers unless the government recognizes that infrastructure for the ferries is similar to infrastructure for the highways
254034 i think its getting to the point where bc ferries is shooting themselves in the foot
254035 prices are high enough that people arent using them and bc ferries are going to lose their revenues and then theyre going to start cutting trips which is just a downward spiral
254036 my better half has a store here which is also affected by ferry fares

254063 as much as this at times almost surreal examination catalogues the things that king and other people stockpile and amass it is more truly an examination of the spaces so in need of something of the emptinesses a life will try to fill one strength of this compendium so stark and strong and honest is that it does cause us to consider whether the existence of the empty spaces might just posit the existence of something meant to fill them

254115 i dont think so it took me since i was 18 to get this one
254116 well now you know it doesnt hurt so much you never know but it looks like it needs creaming
254117 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del proprio destino adesso per riconosco che non tutte le persone sono abbastanza forti da plasmare la propria vita e provo pi indulgenza nei loro confronti di quanta non ne avessi allepoca
254118 sai hachi si dice che per capire davvero limportanza di una persona bosogna prima perderla io credo invece che limportanza di una persona si comprenda davvero quando la si rivede a distanza di tempo non sei daccordo anche tu se adesso rivedessi te e gli altri sicuramente mi viziereste e mi coccolereste come una volta questa prospettiva mi spaventa a tal punto che non riesco a muovermi da qui
254119 ho imparato che non ha importanza quanto e come si ama tutti noi uomini e donne viviamo le nostre vite da soli non ha senso volersi appropriare di qualcuno e nonostante lo sappia a volte me ne dimentico ancora purtroppo non posso fare a meno di pensarci e mi sento cos sola e triste
254120 a quellepoca non ero in grado di amare nessuno in modo maturo ed equilibrato
254121 sai nana veder realizzati i propri sogni ed essere felici sono due cose completamente diverse questa contraddizione mi ancora incomprensibile
254122 il vero amore significa non pretendere niente e proteggere da lontano la donna amata ne sono sicuro e cos per una volta che ti innamori desideri avere tutto da una persona questa la natura umana
254123 ti giuro che se vorrai diventare la mia donna io far limpossibile per renderti felice tu non mi conosci bene ma quando faccio una promessa la mantengo nana quando tu sei al mio fianco io posso fare limpossibile dopo che avrai rotto con takumi e avrai fatto luce nel tuo cuore corri subito da me io ti aspetter
254124 manda pure in frantumi le mie illusioni non ho paura tanto non saprei come fare a cancellare la tua immagine dal mio cuore
254125 ero molto pi fragile di quanto credevo pensavo che un uomo dovesse difendere la sua donna con le ragazze con cui uscivo mi comportavo da spaccone solo ora ho capito che mi sbagliavo nel momento stesso in cui mi sono innamorato di te ho realizzato che la mia virilit e equiparabile a quella di un castoro ma finch tu sarai al mio fianco posso fare limpossibile
254126 lei diversa da tutte le ragazze che conosco loro vogliono avere il mio corpo o addirittura il mio cuore invece lei gentile con me e non pretende niente in cambio questo fa percepire il vero affetto
254127 ti sei sempre presa troppo sul serio passavi le giornate a rimuginare eri triste a quanto pare anche hachiko ti vuole molto bene dovresti esserne felice trovo che i sentimenti che provi per lei siano davvero deliziosi la vostra proprio una bella amicizia
254128 la gente che mi sta intorno mi stressa di continuo dicendo non fare questo non fare quello che ti rovini limmagine ma io sono io non posso smettere si essere me stessa perch me lo ordinano

254133 eis dat het parlement nu in actie komt om de energieprijzen te doen zakken
254134 de prijs van uien wordt niet langer door de markt geregeld en maakt daardoor bokkensprongen eind 2006 en in 2007 ging hij met 400 procent omhoog in maart dit jaar daalde hij met 98 procent om amper een maand later weer te verdrievoudigen

254137 many a doctrine is like a window pane we see truth through it but it divides us from truth
254138 you cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness that created them
254139 the true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self we shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive
254140 we have sleeping beauties inside of us that are waiting to be recognized so that we may awaken to the truth of our existence and connection with all things
254141 if there were nothing but thought in you you wouldnt even know you are thinking you would be like a dreamer who doesnt know he is dreaming when you know you are dreaming you are awake within the dream once there is a certain degree of presence of still and alert attention in human beings perceptions they can sense the divine life essence the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature every life form recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves until this happens however most humans see only the outer forms unaware of the inner essence just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form

254149 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
254150 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
254151 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
254152 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
254153 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
254154 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
254155 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
254156 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there
254157 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal

254172 so because i prematurely ejaculated when losing my virginity you took half my finger
254173 you dont understand peter your sin here is not your short comings as a lover but your lack of compassion as a human being if you had offered her a kleenex or something in way of an apology i perhaps would have let this one slide

254241 there is a secret bond between slowness and memory between speed and forgetting a man is walking down the street at a certain moment he tries to recall something but the recollection escapes him automatically he slows down meanwhile a person who wants to forget a disagreeable incident he has just lived through starts unconsciously to speed up his pace as if he were trying to distance himeself from a thing still too close to him in time the degree of slowness is directly proportional to the intensity of memory the degree of speed is directly proportional to the intensity of forgetting
254242 this is great its fun exciting and useful i could do this forever

254270 the existence of the record or the fact of the discharge
254271 more than three years have elapsed since the offender was discharged
254272 under the police act being of good moral character and not having a criminal record are separate criteria the facts giving rise to a conviction are therefore on their own an insufficient basis for rejecting a candidate for not being of good moral character however a pardon does not erase the past
254273 no further inquiry or interviews were conducted that would have made it possible to counter the presumption that the pardon had restored n s moral integrity

254289 the republicans are losing one of the great swing votes in american politics hispanics and latinos
254290 theyre taking great offense at the tom tancredos of the world
254291 this has been a catastrophic issue for the republican party because theyve made a massive investment in something thats gotten them nothing
254292 republicans have given democrats a way to take a free ride too many people in my party have chosen to demagogue on immigration and that makes it easy for democrats to say wed like to do better
254293 if you put the stress on the fact that these people are here illegally that colors everything else
254294 but if you start out by saying should we create a path for citizenship for those that are here trying to build better lives for themselves and their families then that brings out the compassionate side of the american public
254295 thats the dance were going to see all the way through 2008

254326 the games developers were creating were mostly ports and a lot of consumers were playing it at home and saying well i could play it on a screen like this or i could play it on a smaller screen we dont want to have that competition

254342 this morning we put 13 chefs to the test of making a meal for us were going to taste some of them and pick our favorite
254343 were shooting in new york so new yorks a great background the chefs are all seasoned pros and so far the competitions pretty stiff
254344 their assignment was to prepare and demonstrate a dish that they would make if they were on the today show and we have 13 chefs they all did a two and a half minute demonstration and we are pretty much deadlocked so we narrowed it down to three youre going to make the decision
254345 whoever wins the challenge on december when this episode airs will come on and make their dish on the today show
254346 this is a tomato watermelon feta cheese salad with basil oil and balsamic vinegar
254347 the next one is a saut ed shrimp cabbage roll and its also made with roasted peppers and walnuts theres a spice in there which is sumac
254348 i cant stand that can i do something with this im sorry im sorry im sorry for the person who made this
254349 the next one is seared tuna with asparagus and roasted carrots and a little balsamic glaze
254350 what the fuck why do i have to constantly defend my decision not to settle
254351 be patient sometimes it takes a while for the attraction to come
254352 this is the city my name is friday and im a cop a garbage cop
254353 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
254354 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
254355 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
254356 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
254357 once im healthy im sure ill look at this as a blessing in disguise
254358 right now its a bit painful of course but every athlete goes through these patches and im just grateful that this isnt as bad as it could have been
254359 its wonderful that i can carry the flag for the swiss delegation on my birthday
254360 i still have a score to settle with the olympics and being handed this honor for a second time will give me extra motivation
254361 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
254362 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
254363 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
254364 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
254365 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
254366 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
254367 i wouldnt say that you cant force trades when you get a situation if the fit is not there you just cant force that we hope those guys are going to be okay we just dont know that the fact of the matter is there were no starters on the market available the position players available some we didnt care for and some we did like them but they were rentals and we were not going to trade two of our premium prospects or more for rental players
254368 when i saw this kid last year he was 85 to 88 mph i knew there was power in his arm but hes really showing it now he was consistently 94 to 96 and touched some 7s
254369 hes got good movement on it and his slider is just filthy he gets a lot of miss hits with both of them a lot of ground balls hes still working on his changeup there are some good ones some bad ones and sometimes its just ok he needs more consistency with it but he repeats his delivery and his arm slot well hes tall and lean good pitchers body
254370 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and the final decision is in the best interest of the program
254371 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met
254372 josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
254373 once we won it in 2005 it took a lot of pressure off and then winning last year even took more pressure off
254374 the pressure goes away but the desire is still there and if anything it makes it easier to focus on what youre trying to do and what youre trying to accomplish because you dont sit there and wonder all weekend what it would be like to win
254375 i was here a couple weeks ago to promote the event and man it was cool just touring the track again

254378 you hope to learn something every time you go to the racetrack but with the new car we have spent the first half of the year finding what works and what doesnt
254379 one of our better races came at pocono last month and indianapolis drives a lot like pocono that gives me confidence that we can have a good run this weekend
254380 weve been working very hard to be back in race winning form and i think the last two or three weeks maybe even the last four weeks weve been there
254381 for whatever reason we just couldnt get ahold of the racetrack all weekend at chicagoland weve been struggling on the mile and a half tracks this season and those are the places where we really ran well last year
254382 it was a long night i had a flat tire and had to pit under green and just tried to ride it out there and had a problem
254383 weve kind of struggled for the last few weeks with good cars and just havent quite finished where weve run all night and two weeks ago we finally got everything to go in the same direction the right direction and you know finish it out

254397 my question is in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead
254398 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
254399 i think you are misinformed about what you say not one time

254438 the isi is a very disciplined organization manned by military officials it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda the taliban and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9 11
254439 despite our insistence no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations
254440 weve long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports
254441 there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story

254451 se han estudiado las dos opciones hacer una convencional con una primera parte de larga intentando hacer una buena carrera y cogiendo los m ximos puntos posibles o intentando arriesgar en la clasificaci n hacer una buena crono y luego con los dedos cruzados toda la carrera para que no te adelanten muchos coches y coger tambi n los m ximos puntos posible
254452 y esto depende un poco de lo r pido que vayas si vas bien y eres competitivo puedes hacer la opci n arriesgada y que te salga bien si vas lento es un suicidio o sea que si ma ana por la ma ana vamos bien y estamos confiados igual arriesgamos en la crono y si vemos que vamos regul n optaremos por lo m s seguro

254460 if a basic accounting document can be restricted on security grounds theres no limit to what can be withheld
254461 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
254462 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
254463 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
254464 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
254465 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money

254468 they submitted a package and we responded by submitting our own package
254469 its very natural in the first steps we are going to negotiate over the common ground as they exist inside the two packages if the two parties succeed in agreeing over the common ground that will help us to work on our differences as well to reach an agreement
254470 we have stated clearly that it should come through the normal channel which is jalili to solana and the clock on the two weeks is ticking
254471 the main question here is whether this approach is a continuation of the old approach or is it a totally new approach
254472 if this is the continuation of the old process the iranian people need to defend their right its interests as well
254473 but if the approach changes we will be facing a new situation and the response by the iranian people will be a positive one

254494 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
254495 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
254496 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

254505 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
254506 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
254507 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

254509 fanfiction existed before the internet so its entirely possible nadia would be writing it even without the computer what she wouldnt have is the community that the internet brings
254510 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here
254511 even the most timorous teenage girl couldnt conceive of bella as intimidating its hard to imagine a person more insecure or a situation better set up to magnify her insecurities
254512 no you cant do that but you can do this
254513 you must be doing it wrong rick its dirty and disgusting

254525 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
254526 and five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion

254530 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
254531 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
254532 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
254533 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment

254549 our next stop was the amalienbory slot or palace this is the current residence of queen margrethe ii the architecture is very different from back home in south dakota after the palace we decided it was high time that we saw the little mermaid along the way and across the harbor the new opera house can be seen the final building of this structure was completed in 2005 it is a gift to the danish people paid for by a danish firm at the cost of 2 4 billion kroner roughly 500 million dollars because it was along the way we went into the statens museum for kunst royal museum for fine art it contains a collection of danish and european art with some dating back to the 13th century currently the museum had on display the royal cast collection now back to the little mermaid which is a famous statue that sits in the water of course we all had to take a few pictures

254582 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
254583 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
254584 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
254585 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
254586 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
254587 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie

254589 the huge dead zone of oxygen poor water in the gulf of mexico failed to reach record size this year
254590 hurricane dolly stirred the dead zone like a big pot of soup aerating water that would otherwise have been oxygenless thus by the time scientists finished measuring it the zone was smaller than predicted it should shrink further in the fall with cooler weather fewer algae and more storms mixing the waters
254591 global warming scepticism is being manipulated by tactics reminiscient of an earlier campaign of denial
254592 every product from televisions to teapots takes energy to get to the shopping bag energy to mine raw materials make the product and ship it yet that use goes unreported in oregons tracking of greenhouse gases and energy
254593 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
254594 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
254595 its been an implicit assumption that people come here to stay not to come and go
254596 the only americans who understand whats going on are those living abroad

254601 you want everything to be perfect but that combination of the economy i have a little injury i have a situation and it all came together
254602 ed mcmahons a sympathetic character in this scenario in that he got into a house that possibly he could have afforded if he had been able to keep working then he had an injury that upset his financial apple cart pretty badly
254603 what you dont know is in a normal real estate market if the same lender would have taken a look at an 82 year old man at the tail end of his career and written him a 4 6 million mortgage he had to keeping working to be able to afford
254604 a good analogy would be shoe companies pay athletes millions of dollars to wear a specific shoe so youll have young america buy that shoe because a celebrity endorses it its the same thing with a house

254613 im a poet whether im writing cooking singing scribbling or walking down the street thats all i do ask anyone whos needed something more out of me im just a poet all the time
254614 there is nothing to express nothing with which to express nothing from which to express no power to express no desire to express together with the obligation to express
254615 all i know is when i was like six amy poston said look potato bugs
254616 if it smells like shit wherever you go check your own shoes
254617 when playing solitaire you always feel a bit lonelier as you start to win

254621 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
254622 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
254623 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
254624 personally id like to do another doom movie i thought working with it was a blast
254625 there are some lessons we learned the best way to do things better is to get the experience
254626 well see what happens when we get further along in development of the new doom game and theres more buzz and we share more about what the game will be about
254627 we have concerns about the 360 version of rage because of the economics of the platform in terms of what it costs to go to multiple discs
254628 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue even though we feel the 360 has superior hardware the size limitations may mean that we may not have as much texture density or resolution on the 360 version
254629 let me be clear this is an open question we have these tech issues and we are working with microsoft to solve them
254630 i know that john is pretty much brass tacks on these issues and before the ps3 was ever released he raised the same issues then as now
254631 had a bunch of hardware engineers talking about theoretical power but carmack said yeah this isnt how software people work and they said yeah this is how they should work
254632 complaining about that is sort of a worthless exercise at this point
254633 the ps3 is what it is and its not going to change you have to adapt thats what we have done with id tech 5
254634 today we are saying that rage may look better on the ps3 than the 360
254635 i think the blu ray strategy and some of the other things theyve done in terms how the ps3 is positioned as a home entertainment device shows that sony is placing their bet on the ps3 as a marathon runner not a sprint and microsoft was a little more focused on the short term goals

254670 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
254671 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
254672 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
254673 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
254674 starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on mr obama that republican operatives ran against harold ford
254675 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
254676 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
254677 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
254678 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

254681 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
254682 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
254683 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
254684 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
254685 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
254686 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
254687 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
254688 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
254689 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
254690 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
254691 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
254692 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
254693 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
254694 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
254695 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
254696 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
254697 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
254698 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
254699 la mayor a del p blico comenz a abuchear la protesta pero obama calm los nimos y prometi intercambiar impresiones con los manifestantes en el turno de preguntas y respuestas despu s del discurso
254700 yo habl claro sobre cada uno de esos asuntos quiz no habl de la manera que a usted le hubiera gustado
254701 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
254702 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
254703 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
254704 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
254705 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
254706 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
254707 cuando el adquirente v a licitaci n es un organismo p blico la preocupaci n por el pago de sobre precios por sobre los niveles de competencia es a n mayor por varias razones en primer lugar
254708 el impacto seg n estimaciones de la oecd para chile de este tipo de pr cticas de colusi n en materia de licitaciones estar a siendo anualmente del orden de los 40 millones de d lares como sobre precios pagados por el estado chileno en sus procesos de compra lo anterior calculado a partir del pnb del porcentaje del pnb que representan las compras p blicas un 1 de casos de colusi n entre oferentes y sobre precios promedio de 20 las ltimas 2 estimaciones bastante conservadoras
254709 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
254710 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
254711 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
254712 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
254713 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
254714 hes back thats all i can tell you hes back
254715 we werent expecting it but they made a run and we kept our composure and buckled down defensively and opened the game up
254716 he had a great game against us a few years ago and he was real brash about it trash talking and things of that nature so its my responsibility to bring it to him
254717 he reminded me of it so we sicced the doberman on him
254718 we played what we felt was pretty good defense everyone who was on the court played while and its a matter of getting out there and feeling you can beat whoever youre playing theyre focused they really are
254719 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
254720 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
254721 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
254722 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
254723 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
254724 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
254725 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
254726 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
254727 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
254728 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
254729 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
254730 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
254731 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
254732 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
254733 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
254734 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
254735 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
254736 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
254737 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
254738 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
254739 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
254740 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
254741 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
254742 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
254743 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
254744 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
254745 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
254746 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
254747 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
254748 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
254749 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
254750 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
254751 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
254752 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
254753 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
254754 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
254755 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
254756 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
254757 who are open to doing something on the production side
254758 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
254759 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
254760 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
254761 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
254762 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
254763 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
254764 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
254765 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
254766 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
254767 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
254768 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
254769 it is foolhardy to put something like this at the lake it freezes our ability to have the kind of development we want there
254770 we are not obligated to pass this thing and i dont think we should this is not a good thing for our city
254771 oshawa is also in a unique situation because it has access to a local corn supply and its close to a large ethanol market in the gta
254772 councils decision will decide whether i stay farming in this community or in this province
254773 mitigative measures will not make the proposal acceptable at this location
254774 this is a clear case of an incompatible land use proposal
254775 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
254776 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
254777 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
254778 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
254779 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
254780 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
254781 i think it puts us in a good position going forward from a baseball standpoint and also from the position of standing for something as an organization
254782 feel like a team for the first time in a while
254783 will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
254784 the rebates would be fully paid for with five years of a windfall profits tax on record oil company profits
254785 do you think that i could succeed as a freelancer
254786 prior to implementing rims we really didnt have a system everything was essentially paper based or in peoples heads
254787 we would pick what we could send back paper adjustments and then they would have to make adjustments and send that information back to us the entire process was essentially manual
254788 as far as that system knew every item in our warehouse had one location where it was stored but in reality we would have that item in two or three places things were just getting scattered and we had no real control or visibility into our inventory
254789 we had a lot of big deep locations that would hold twelve pallets we had gone over to a system called bailment where the vendors actually own what is in our warehouse so a lot of them started doing vendor managed inventory where they were keeping track of how much was in our warehouse the process became a little closer to just in time jit where they would have just a couple of weeks supply the issue was that these big deep locations were meant to hold a couple months worth instead of a couple of weeks so we had a lot of space that was assigned to an item that wasnt being utilized
254790 our product line was in the beginning of an expansion period that still continues to this day
254791 we were reaching the point where we were going to start shipping orders incomplete because we were not able to get items to the pick locations in time to meet the shipments
254792 we were spending a lot of time looking for things there was a pretty high cost i had two to three employees that were spending all of their time looking for the stuff and other people were picking up their work so the work level had increased dramatically for everybody but we werent seeing any increased productivity and in fact we were losing opportunity
254793 after looking at the various products on the market robocom was the only vendor that had exactly what we were looking for and they provided us with answers to all of our questions rims was a really good fit for our needs
254794 we completed the implementation in half the time of robocoms previous shortest install it took just 16 weeks from start to acceptance and it was really much shorter than that because there were four weeks at the end where we were up and running and doing some little debugging once we switched over to live testing we never went back user adoption has been very successful within days everyone was using the system and we were immediately seeing efficiency improvements
254795 as soon as an item is received on the floor our legacy system knows and it has been added to that inventory so we have immediate visibility
254796 as we pick it then creates more replenishment not for the orders but to keep minimum stock levels at each of the pick locations a crucial step for maintaining our efficiency levels and meeting customer demand
254797 everything that is done with our distribution center is done with rims
254798 if we move a product from one spot on the floor to another we scan it from one location to another so all of our receipts all of our product movement all of our order fulfillment they are all done with rims
254799 previously we shipped about 1 8 million cases per year and this year we are projecting we will do about 2 8 million we can attribute that dramatic change to the fact that we are running a more efficient business there is no way we could be getting that much out the door if we werent using rims
254800 we are shipping a million more cases a year and at the same time also receiving a million more so that is two million more cases that we are actually managing to only add eight employees over six years while realizing that kind of growth is phenomenal
254801 i can go into a screen in rims and i can call up an item and i can look and see how many cases we have in each location how much movement there is planned whether it is just re warehouse movement or picks to fulfill an order i can look at the receiving floor and see how many pallets are there waiting to be stored i can look at individual orders for today tomorrow if an agent calls with a question about an order i can immediately look it up and give them the information they need the system gives me everything i need at my fingertips there is no more guessing or hunting for inventory we now have total control over our warehouse
254802 we gained a 33 efficiency increase meaning we are able to store 33 more despite losing 25 of our physical storage space
254803 rims is flexible enough that all of our additional physical changes have been very easily accommodated by rims to give us that visibility
254804 we have some deliveries that arent being made until 4 00 or 5 00 in the evening because we only ship out of one door
254805 we have 1100 cases an hour we are able to ship out the door but the more cases we have it just makes for that much longer of a day so we are looking at adding sortation to our conveyer system
254806 robocom has put us in contact with some vendors and they are helping us try to solve this issue and meet our goals that is the benefit of working with robocom they have become a true partner for the long haul i feel very lucky that we found robocom they are such a good fit i am very thankful that things have worked out as nicely as they have
254807 previously we shipped about 1 8 million cases per year and this year we are projecting we will do about 2 8 million we can attribute that dramatic change to the fact that we are running a more efficient business there is no way we could be getting that much out the door if we werent using rims
254808 we are shipping a million more cases a year and at the same time also receiving a million more so that is two million more cases that we are actually managing to only add eight employees over six years while realizing that kind of growth is phenomenal
254809 increases in hearing loss prevalence occurred earlier among participants with smoking noise exposure and cardiovascular risks
254810 the results of our study suggest that prevention and screening must begin at least in young adulthood and that efforts should be intensified among white and mexican american men
254811 i am honored that president magrath has given me this opportunity to serve him my alma mater and my home state as wvus interim chief of staff
254812 during this transitional period i look forward to helping to make a great land grant university even better
254813 jay cole and i by chance became neighbors in our college board offices and i learned about his love for west virginia and its flagship university
254814 he wants to serve wvu by helping me and i am delighted he will do so as we all press ahead
254815 wvu is fortunate to have a man of jay coles experience depth of knowledge character and integrity assume an important role in the presidents office
254816 while we will miss his presence at the college board and will eagerly await his return when his appointment ends we know he will be a tremendous asset to peter magrath and the leadership team at wvu
254817 from academic research to international education to service learning jay has played a crucial and leading role in shaping west virginias higher education policy landscape
254818 he is an extraordinary choice to implement the vision of president c peter magrath and the west virginia university board of governors
254819 we are fortunate jay cole has been chosen by interim president magrath to be wvus chief of staff he has an extensive knowledge of higher education in west virginia and with his work at the college board he is well versed on higher education at the national level
254820 why dont they finish with a clip of what you do have

254828 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
254829 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
254830 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
254831 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
254832 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
254833 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

254844 these are all new models with added standard features versus the previous generation and the a4 when equipped with the all new 2 0tfsi engine and quattro all wheel drive system delivers better fuel economy and acceleration than the key competitors in this segment

254906 a weather radio should be part of a well stocked disaster kit
254907 they are a valuable resource not just during hurricane season but throughout the year
254908 the radios are for occupant protection especially during this storm season
254909 what some many residents dont realize is that this is a simple life saving device which should be in every home we feel a noaa weather radio is just as important as having a smoke detector to keep you and your family safe
254910 we wanted to do something for the iphone but we just didnt have the scheduling or the resources available
254911 the iphone as a device is in the same generation power wise as the ps2 or xbox
254912 the graphics are a little lower but the ram is a lot higher you could easily spend 10 million on an iphone game but the market just cant support that yet
254913 we have a title we want to develop exclusively for iphone
254914 im not announcing anything specifically but it would be a graphical tour de force
254915 the graphics are the same or even better than a ps2 or xbox
254916 in the first games i was nervous and made a lot of mistakes
254917 then i found my rhythm and started believing in myself
254918 most trial lawyers have been defrauded of their legal education
254919 is it not a miracle that after having been defrauded of their education at the hands of the entrenched in our law schools that american lawyers haven taken on the fraudulent mindset of their educators who have defrauded them
254920 american foreign legions aka the army of the living dead
254921 would reduce the medical industry to an economic shadow of its former self
254922 the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong but the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people trust in him at all times ye people pour out your hearts before him god is a refuge for us
254923 charleston is laid in ashes the battle began upon our entrenchments upon bunkers hill saturday morning about 3 oclock and has not ceased yet and it is now three oclock sabbath afternoon it is expected they will come out over the neck tonight and a dreadful battle must ensue almighty god cover the heads of our countrymen and be a shield to our dear friends
254924 a patriot without religion in my estimation is as great a paradox as an honest man without the fear of god
254925 we went to meeting at wells and had the pleasure of hearing my friend upon
254926 seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
254927 this day i went to dr allisons meeting in the afternoon and heard the dr francis allison give a good discourse upon the lords supper i had rather go to church we have better sermons better prayers better speakers softer sweeter music and genteeler company and i must confess that the episcopal church is quite as agreeable to my taste as the presbyterian i like the congregational way best next to that the independent
254928 it is the duty of the clergy to accommodate their discourses to the times to preach against such sins as are most prevalent and recommend such virtues as are most wanted for example if exorbitant ambition and venality are predominant ought they not to warn their hearers against those vices if public spirit is much wanted should they not inculcate this great virtue if the rights and duties of christian magistrates and subjects are disputed should they not explain them show their nature ends limitations and restrictions how muchsoever it may move the gall of massachusetts
254929 statesmen my dear sir may plan and speculate for liberty but it is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand
254930 the only foundation of a free constitution is pure virtue and if this cannot be inspired into our people in a greater measure than they have it now they may change their rulers and the forms of government but they will not obtain a lasting liberty
254931 before god i believe the hour has come my judgement approves this measure and my whole heart is in it all that i have and all that i am and all that i hope in this life i am now ready here to stake upon it and i leave off as i began that live or die survive or perish i am for the declaration it is my living sentiment and by the blessing of god it shall be my dying sentiment independence now and independence for ever
254932 the object is great which we have in view and we must expect a great expense of blood to obtain it but we should always remember that a free constitution of civil government cannot be purchased at too dear a rate as there is nothing on this side of the new jerusalem of equal importance to mankind
254933 the second day of july 1776 will be the most memorable epoch in the history of america
254934 you will think me transported with enthusiasm but i am not i am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost to maintain this declaration and support and defend these states yet through all the gloom i can see the rays of ravishing light and glory i can see that the end is worth more than all the means that posterity will triumph in that days transaction even though we may regret it which i trust in god we shall not
254935 we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion avarice ambition revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government ofany other
254936 as no truth is more clearly taught in the volume of inspiration nor any more fully demonstrated by the experience of all ages than that a deep sense and a due acknowledgement of the growing providence of a supreme being and of the accountableness of men to him as the searcher of hearts and righteous distributer of rewards and punishments are conducive equally to the happiness ofindividuals and to the well being of communities
254937 i have thought proper to recommend and i hereby recommend accordingly that thursday the twenty fifth day of april next be observed throughout the united states of america as a day of solemn humiliation fasting and prayer that the citizens on that day abstain as far as may be from their secular occupation and devote the time to the sacred duties of religion in public and in private that they call to mind our numerous offenses against the most high god confess them before him with the sincerest penitence implore his pardoning mercy through the great mediator and redeemer for our past transgressions and that through the grace of his holy spirit we may be disposed and enabled to yield a more suitable obedience to his righteous requisitions in time to come that he would interpose to arrest the progress of that impiety and licentiousness in principle and practice so offensive to himself and so ruinous to mankind that he would make us deeply sensible that
254938 i pray heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this house and all that shall hereafter inhabit it may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof
254939 religion and virtue are the only foundations not only of all free government but of social felicity under all governments and in all the combinations of human society
254940 now i will avow that i then believe and now believe that those general principles of christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of god and that those principles of liberty are as unalterable as human nature and our terrestrial mundane system
254941 have you ever found in history one single example of a nation thoroughly corrupted that was afterwards restored to virtue and without virtue there can be no political liberty will you tell me how to prevent riches from becoming the effects of temperance and industry will you tell me how to prevent luxury from producing effeminacy intoxication extravagance vice and folly i believe no effort in favor is lost
254942 the ten commandments and the sermon on the mount contain my religion
254943 as i understand the christian religion it was and is a revelation
254944 liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people who have a right an indisputable unalienable indefeasible divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge i mean the character and conduct of their rulers
254945 i have myself for many years made it a practice to read through the bible once ever year my custom is to read four to five chapters every morning immediately after rising from my bed i employs about an hour of my time
254946 the highest glory of the american revolution was this it connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the principles of christianity
254947 from the day of the declaration they the american people were bound by the laws of god which they all and by the laws of the gospel which they nearly all acknowledge as the rules of their conduct
254948 why is it that next to the birthday of the savior of the world your most joyous and most venerated festival returns on this day is it not that in the chain of human events the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked with the birthday ofthe savior that it forms a leading event in the progress of the gospel dispensation is it not that the declaration of independence first organized the social compact on the foundation ofthe redeemers mission upon earth that it laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of christianity and gave to the world the first irrevocable pledge of the fulfillment of the prophecies announced directly from heaven at the birth of the saviour and predicted by the greatest of the hebrew prophets 600 years before
254949 i speak as a man of the world to men of the world and i say to you search the scriptures the bible is the book of all others to be read at all ages and in all conditions of human life not to be read in small portions of one or two chapters every day and never to be intermitted unless by some overruling necessity
254950 posterity you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom i hope you will make good use of it
254951 the bible carries with it the history of the creation the fall and redemption of man and discloses to him in the infant born at bethlehem the legislator and savior of the world
254952 among the natural rights of the colonists are these first a right to life second to liberty third to property together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner they can these are evident branches of the duty of self preservation commonly called the first law of nature all men have a right to remain in a state of nature as long as they please and in case of intolerable oppression civil or religious to leave the society they belong to and ernter into another now what liberty can there be where property is taken away without consent
254953 the rights of the colonists as christians may be best understood by reading and carefully studying the institution of the great law giver and head of the christian church which are to be found clearly written and promulgated in the new testament
254954 we have this day restored the sovereign to whom all men ought to be obedient he reigns in heaven and from the rising to the setting of the sun let his kingdom come
254955 he therefore is the truest friend to the liberty of this country who tries most to promote its virtue and who so far as his power and influence extend will not suffer a man to be chosen into any office of power and trust who is not a wise and virtuous man the sum of all is if we would most truly enjoy this gift of heaven let us become a virtuous people
254956 he who is void of virtuous attachments in private life is or very soon will be void of all regard for his country there is seldom an instance of a man guilty of betraying his country who had not before lost the feeling of moral obligations in his private connections
254957 the said constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms
254958 principally and first of all i resign my soul to the almighty being who gave it and my body i commit to the dust relying on the merits of jesus christ for the pardon of my sins
254959 should not the bible regain the place it once held as a schoolbook its morals are pure its examples are captivating and noble in no book is there so good english so pure and so elegant and by teaching all the same they will speak alike and the bible will justly remain the standard of language as well as of faith
254960 it should therefore be among the first objects of those who wish well to the national prosperity to encourage and support the principles of religion and morality and early to place the youth under the forming hand of society that by instruction they may be molded to the love of virtue and good order
254961 man considered as a creature must necessarily be subject to the laws of his creator for he is entirely a dependent being
254962 the doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures
254963 blasphemy against the almighty is denying his being or providence or uttering contumelious reproaches on our savior christ it is punished at common law by fine and imprisonment for christianity is part of the laws of the land
254964 if the legislature will positively enact a thing to be done the judges are not at liberty to reject it for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature which should be subversive of all government
254965 the preservation of christianity as a national religion is abstracted from its own intrinsic truth of the utmost consequence to the civil state which a single instance will sufficiently demonstrate
254966 the belief of a future state of rewards and punishments the entertaining just ideas of the main attributes ofthe supreme being and a firm persuasion that he superintends and will finally compensate every action in human life all which are revealed in the doctrines of our savior christ these are the grand foundations of all judicial oaths which call god to witness the truth of those facts which perhaps may be only known to him and the party attesting all moral evidences therefore all confidence in human veracity must be weakened by apostasy and overthrown by total infidelity
254967 wherefore all affronts to christianity or endeavors to depreciate its efficacy in those who have once professed it are highly deserving of censure
254968 i have lived sir a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proofs i see of this truth that god governs the affairs of men and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid
254969 we have been assured sir in the sacred writings that
254970 i therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessing on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service
254971 it is the duty of mankind on all suitable occasions to acknowledge their dependence on the divine being that almighty god would mercifully interpose and still the rage of war among the nations and that he would take this province under his protection confound the designs and defeat the attempts of its enemies and unite our hearts and strengthen our hands in every undertaking that may be for the public good and for our defense and security in this time of danger
254972 i never doubted for instance the existence of the deity that he made the world and governed it by his providence that the most acceptable service of god was the doing good to man that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be punished and virtue rewarded either here or hereafter
254973 freedom is not a gift bestowed upon us by other men but a right that belongs to us by the laws of god and nature
254974 the pleasures of this world are rather from gods goodness than our own merit
254975 moses lifting up his wand and dividing the red sea and pharaoh in his chariot overwhelmed with the waters this motto rebellion to tyrants is obedience to god
254976 a bible and a newspaper in every house a good school in every district all studied and appreciated as they merit are the principal support of virtue morality and civil liberty
254977 hence bad examples to youth are more rare in america which must be comfortable consideration to parents to this may be truly added that serious religion under its various denominations is not only tolerated but respected and practiced
254978 atheism is unknown there infidelity rare and secret so that persons may live to a great age in that country without having their piety shocked by meeting with either an atheist or an infidel
254979 and the divine being seems to have manifested his approbation of the mutual forbearance and kindness with which the different sects treat each other by the remarkable prosperity with which he has been pleased to favor the whole country
254980 here is my creed i believe in one god the creator of the universe that he governs it by his providence that he ought to be worshipped
254981 the body of benjamin franklin printer like the cover of an old book its contents torn out and stripped of its lettering and gilding lies here food for worms yet the work itself shall not be lost for it will as he believed appear once more in a new and more beautiful edition corrected and amended by the author
254982 i now offer you the outline of the plan they have suggested let an association be formed to be denominated the christian constitutional society its object to be first the support of the christian religion second the support of the united states
254983 i have carefully examined the evidences of the christian religion and if i was sitting as a juror upon its authenticity i would unhesitatingly give my verdict in its favor i can prove its truth as clearly as any proposition ever submitted to the mind of man
254984 a virtuous citizen will regard his own country as a wife to whom he is bound to be exclusively faithful and affectionate and he will watch every propensity of his heart to wander towards a foreign country which he will regard as a mistress that may pervert his fidelity
254985 in circumstances dark as these it becomes us as men and christians to reflect that whilst every prudent measure should be taken to ward off the impending judgements
254986 it is the happiness of his church that when the powers of earth and hell combine against it
254987 resolved that it be and hereby is recommended to the good people of this colony of all denominations that thursday the eleventh day of may next be set apart as a day of public humiliation fasting and prayer to confess the sins to implore the forgiveness of all our transgression and a blessing on the husbandry manufactures and other lawful employments of this people and especially that the union of the american colonies in defense of their rights for hitherto we desire to thank almighty god may be preserved and confirmed and that america may soon behold a gracious interposition of heaven
254988 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
254989 it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religions but on the gospel of jesus christ for this very reason peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum prosperity and freedom of worship here
254990 the bible is worth all other books which have ever been printed
254991 bad men cannot make good citizens a vitiated state of morals a corrupted public conscience are incompatible with freedom
254992 it is when people forget god that tyrants forge their chains
254993 the great object is that every man be armed everyone who is able may have a gun
254994 this is all the inheritance i give to my dear family the religion of christ will give them one which will make them rich indeed
254995 providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers and it is the duty as well as the privilege and interest of our christian nation to select and prefer christians for their rulers
254996 unto him who is the author and giver of all good i render sincere and humble thanks for his merciful and unmerited blessings and especially for our redemption and salvation by his beloved son
254997 he who permits himself to tell a lie once finds it much easier to do it a second and third time till at length it becomes habitual he tells lies without attending to it and truths without the worlds believing him this falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart and it time depraves all its good dispositions
254998 i never believed there was one code of morality for a public and another for a private man
254999 the only foundation for useful education in a republic is to be laid in religion
255000 god who gave us life gave us liberty and can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god that they are not to be violated but with his wrath indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
255001 to the corruptions of christianity i am indeed opposed but not to the genuine precepts of jesus himself i am a christian in the only sense in which he wished any one to be sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others
255002 i consider the doctrines of jesus as delivered by himself to contain the outlines of the sublimest system of morality that has ever been taught but i hold in the most profound detestation and execration the corruptions of it which have been invented
255003 earnestly recommended to all officers and soldiers diligently to attend divine services
255004 merchants have no country the mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains
255005 a more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics i have never seen it is a document in proof that i am a real christian that is to say a disciple of the doctrines of jesus
255006 i have always said i always will say that the studious perusal of the sacred volume will make better citizens better fathers and better husbands
255007 deemed in other countries incompatible with good government and yet proved by our experience to be its best support
255008 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
255009 no free man shall ever be de barred the use of arms the strongest reason for the people to retain their right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
255010 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants
255011 in questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution
255012 separation of church amp state letter written to the baptists in danbury connecticut on january 1 1802
255013 gentlemen the affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which are so good to express towards me on behalf of the danbury association give me the highest satisfaction my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents and in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legislative powers of the government reach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion of prohibiting the free excercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience i shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man to all of his natural rights convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties i reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessings of the common father and creator of man and tender you and your religious association assurances of my high respect and esteem
255014 the patriot who feels himself in the service of god who acknowledges him in all his ways has the promise of almighty direction and will find his word in his greatest darkness a lantern to his feet and a lamp unto his paths he will therefore seek to establish for his country in the eyes of the world such a character as shall make her not unworthy of the name of a christian nation
255015 history records that the money changers have used every form of abuse intrigue deceit and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling the money and its issuance
255016 there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the of the people by the gradual and silent encroachment of those in power than by violent an sudden usurpation
255017 it is indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the community agst against the incapicity negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate
255018 cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the cross of christ
255019 it is the duty of every man to render to the creator such homage before any man can be considered as a member of civil society he must be considered as a subject of the governor of the universe
255020 we have staked the whole future of american civilization not upon the power of government far from it we have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves to control ourselves to sustain ourselves according to the ten commandments of god
255021 religion is the only solid basis of good morals therefore education should teach the precepts of religion and the duties of man toward god
255022 americans need never fear their government because of the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation
255023 for everything there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven
255024 in the language of the holy writ there is a time for all things there is a time to preach and a time to fight
255025 tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph
255026 what we obtain too cheaply we esteem too lightly tis dearness only that gives everything its value heaven knows how to put a price upon its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated
255027 the cause of america is in a great measure the cause of all mankind where some say is the king of america ill tell you friend he reigns above
255028 yet that we may not appear to be defective even in earthly honors let a day be solemnly set apart for proclaiming the charter let it be placed on the divine law the word of god let a crown be placed thereon
255029 the almighty implanted in us these inextinguishable feelings for good and wise purposes they are the guardians of his image in our heart they distinguish us from the herd of common animals
255030 i would give worlds if i had them if the age of reason had never been published o lord help stay with me it is hell to be left alone
255031 i die in perfect composure and resignation to the will of my creator god
255032 if thou wouldst rule well thou must rule for god and to do that thou must be ruled by him those who will not be governed by god will be ruled by tyrants
255033 i have alternately been called an aristocrat and a democrat i am neither i am a christocrat
255034 if you ask an american who is his master he will tell you he has none nor any governor but jesus christ
255035 government is not reason it is not eloqence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
255036 the thing that separates the american christian from every other person on earth is the fact that he would rather die on his feet than live on his knees
255037 i hope that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality the preeminence of free government exemplifies by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world
255038 the general orders this day to be religiously observed by the forces under his command exactly in manner directed by the continental congress it is therefore strictly enjoined on all officers and soldiers to attend divine service and it is expected that all those who go to worship do take their arms ammunition and accoutrements and are prepared for immediate action if called upon
255039 the time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether americans are to be freemen or slaves whether they are to have any property they can call their own whether their houses and farms are to be pillaged and destroyed and themselves consigned to a state of wretchedness from which no human efforts will deliver them the fate of unborn millions will now depend under god on the courage of this army our cruel and unrelenting enemy leaves us only the choice of brave resistance or the most abject submission we have therefore to resolve to conquer or die
255040 while we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion to the distinguished character of patriot it should be our highest glory to laud the more distinguished character of christian
255041 it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes
255042 no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the united states
255043 whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of almighty god to obey his will to be grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and favor
255044 now therefore i do recommend and assign thursday the twenty sixth day of november next to be devoted by the people of these united states
255045 that we then may all unite unto him our sincere and humble thanks for his kind care and protection ofthe people of this country previous to their becoming a nation for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of his providence in the course and conclusion of the late war
255046 for the great degree of tranquility union and plenty which we have since enjoyed for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness and particularly the national one now lately instituted for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed
255047 and also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great lord and ruler of nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions to promote the knowledge and practice of the true religion and virtue given under my hand at the city of new york the 3rd of october a d 1789
255048 sunday morning almighty god and most merciful father who didst command the children of israel to offer a daily sacrifice to thee that thereby they might glorify and praise thee for thy protection both night and day receive o lord my morning sacrifice which i now offer up to thee
255049 i yield thee humble and hearty thanks that thou hast preserved me from the dangers of the night past and brought me to the light of this day and the comfort thereof a day which is consecrated to thine own service and for thine own honour
255050 let my heart therefore gracious god be so affected with the glory and majesty of it that i may not do mine own works but wait on thee and discharge those weighty duties thou required of me and since thou art a god of pure eyes and will be sanctified in all who draw nearer to thee who dost not regard the sacrifice of fools nor hear sinners who tread in thy courts pardon i beseech thee my sins remove them from thy presence as far as the east is from the west and accept of me for the merits of thy son jesus christ that when i come into thy temple and compass thine altar my prayer may come before thee as incense and as i desire thou wouldst hear me calling upon thee in my prayers so give me peace to hear the calling on me in thy word that it may be wisdom righteousness reconciliation and peace to the saving of my soul in the day ofthe lord jesus
255051 grant that i may hear it with reverence receive it with meekness mingle it with faith and that it may accomplish in me gracious god the good work for which thou hast sent it
255052 bless my family kindred friends and country be our god and guide this day and forever for his sake who lay down in the grave and arose again for us jesus christ our lord amen
255053 it is impossible to rightly govern the world without god and the bible
255054 it is impossible to account for the creation of the universe without the agency of a supreme being it is impossible to govern the universe without the aid of a supreme being it is impossible to reason without arriving at a supreme being
255055 of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens
255056 hold on my friends to the constitution and to the republic for which it stands miracles do not cluster and what has happened once in 6000 years may not happen again hold on to the constitution for if the american constitution should fail there will be anarchy throughout the world
255057 if we abide by the principles taught in the bible our country will go on prospering and to prosper but if we and our posterity neglect its instruction and authority no man can tell how sudden a catastrophe may ovenvhelm us and bury all our glory in profound obscurity
255058 finally let us not forget the religious character of our origin
255059 let us cherish these sentiments and extend this influence still more widely in full conviction that that is the happiest society which partakes in the highest degree of the mild and peaceful spirit of christianity
255060 god grants liberty only to those who love it and are always ready to guard and defend it
255061 the hand that destroys the constitution rends our union asunder forever
255062 if religious books are not widely circulated among the masses in this country i do not know what is going to become of us as a nation if truth be not diffused error will be if god and his word are not known and received the devil and his works will gain the ascendancy if the evangelical volume does not reach every hamlet the pages of a corrupt and licentious literature will if the power of the gospel is not felt throughout the length and breadth of the land anarchy and misrule degradation and misery corruption and darkness will reign without mitigation or end
255063 i shall stand by the union and by all who stand by it i shall do justice to the whole country in all i say and act for the good of the whole country in all i do i mean to stand upon the constitution i need no other platform i shall know but one country the ends i aim at shall be my countrys my gods and truths i was born an american i live an american i shall die an american and i intend to perform the duties incumbent upon me in that character to the end of my career i mean to do this with absolute disregard of personal consequences what are the personal consequences what is the individual man with all the good or evil that may betide him in comparison with the good or evil which may befall a great country and in the midst of great transactions which concern that countrys fate let the consequences be what they will i am careless no man can suffer too much and no man can fall too soon if he suffer or if he fall in the defense of the liberties and constitution of his country
255064 this is the book i have read the bible through many times and now make it a practice to read it through once every year it is a book of all others for lawyers as well as divines and i pity the man who cannot find in it a rich supply of thought and of rules for conduct it fits man for life it prepares him for death
255065 what is the greatest thought that ever passed through your mind
255066 discipline our youth in early life in sound maxims of moral political and religious duties
255067 the bible was americas basic text book in all fields
255068 gods word contained in the bible has fumished all necessary rules to direct our conduct
255069 in my view the christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children under a free government ought to be instructed no truth is more evident to my mind than that the christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people
255070 the brief exposition of the constitution of the united states will unfold to young persons the principles of republican government and it is the sincere desire of the writer that our citizens should early understand that the genuine source of correct republican principles is the bible particularly the new testament or the christian religion
255071 the religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of christ and his apostles which enjoins humility piety and benevolence which acknowledges in every person a brother or a sister and a citizen with equal rights
255072 the moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all of our civil constitutions and laws
255073 when you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers let it be impressed on your mind that god commands you to choose for rulers just men who will rule in the fear of god the preservation of a republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty
255074 if the citizens neglect their duty and place unprincipled men in office the government will soon be corrupted laws will be made not for the public good so much as for the selfish or local purposes
255075 corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws the public revenues will be squandered on unworthy men and the rights of the citizens will be violated or disregarded
255076 if a republican government fails to secure public prosperity and happiness it must be because the citizens neglect the divine commands and elect bad men to make and administer the laws

255084 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan

255086 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
255087 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
255088 wal mart has once again been exposed for what it really is a corporation that will go to any length to put profits ahead of its workers
255089 wal mart has talked a lot about changing its ways on health care the environment and workers rights but this article shows that all that talk hasnt translated into action

255097 i began to receive or hear high frequency tones in my ears
255098 this inter cerebral hearing is used to drive the victim mad as no one else can hear the voices transmitted into the brain of the target transmission of auditory data directly into the targets brains using microwave carrier beams is now common practice instead of using excitation potentials one uses a transducer to modify the spoken word into elf audiograms that are then superimposed on a pulse modulated microwave beam
255099 russian satellites controlled by advanced computers can send voices in ones own language interweaving into natural thoughts to the population of choice to form diffused artificial thought the chemistry and electricity of the human brain can be manipulated by satellite and even suicide can be induced through ferocious anti humanitarian means the extremist groups are fabricated the troubles and bloody disturbances are instigated by advanced tele means via russian satellites in many countries in asia africa europe and latin america

255119 blue cross goal was to join together with local employers and providers and help our members in the area who have diabetes be healthier
255120 similar to the medical home concept as part of this program physicians provided comprehensive coordinated care for their patients that enhanced their health
255121 taking these tests and knowing the results are significant first steps toward better diabetes management we are encouraged that with early detection treatment and proper management people with diabetes may prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with the disease which range from heart and blood vessel disease blindness and kidney failure to nerve damage foot ulcers and urological problems

255192 theres also another kind of violence that were going to have to think about its not necessarily the physical violence but the violence that we perpetrate on each other in other ways
255193 the violence of men and women who have worked all their lives and suddenly have the rug pulled out from under them because their job is moved to another country
255194 the violence of children whose voices are not heard in communities that are ignored
255195 theres a lot of different forms of violence in our society and so much of it is rooted in our incapacity to recognize ourselves in each other

255199 he fed into some of the worst stereotypes that my two young daughters are having to deal with today in america the notions that as young african american women who i hope will be athletes that that somehow makes them less beautiful or less important it was a degrading comment its one that im not interested in supporting

255201 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
255202 my advice to senator obama is to run as a man and leader and the american people will evaluate you as such not as a victim this is a presidential race based solely on a capacity to lead the united states of america it is not about skin tone however perhaps we should come to expect these immature statements it also seems rather humorous that the presidential candidate who was supposed to be such a uniter and transcend race is the one talking about it the most if senator obama was confident in his abilities and character he would not need to create a crutch for failure senator obama has just tipped his hand any criticism of him and his policies will be directly attributed to racism i congratulate senator obama for taking race relations in america back some 30 years
255203 necesitas salir al ancho mundo y buscar tu fortuna no te puedes quedar ah sentado esperando a que el cambio venga a llamar a tu puerta tienes que hacer un esfuerzo tienes que mostrar algo de fe tienes que hacer todo lo que puedas eso significa correr el riesgo de parecer un tonto si tu intento resulta fallido o que tus planes resultan estar mal concebidos recuerda que la energ a empleada en la persecuci n de una causa que merezca la pena nunca se pierde aunque no pueda dar inmediatamente un resultado evidente
255204 can make a big difference in starting pay and that difference is largely sustained into midcareer

255213 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
255214 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
255215 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
255216 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
255217 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom

255223 agilists celebrate our ability to respond to change rather than following a rigorous plan which sounds great until youre asking a product manager who just invested a lot of time and money in her market research to reshuffle the backlog based on new information theyll be torn the market research says that they should stick to the plan the new information says that it should change the greater the investment in the market research the more challenging it is to make the change

255243 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
255244 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
255245 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
255246 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
255247 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and i will assume that it is likely to be in the new year

255251 my team has worked doubly hard through the last several months to try to avoid this situation
255252 weve even gone to the extent of showing alternative properties to them
255253 all along the line weve been trying to give good advice and support them through this difficult time
255254 you owe your conscience to god to one another you owe nothing but mutual love
255255 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea v 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband v 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god v 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away v 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful v 6 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely v 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son v 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
255256 every house where love abides and friendship is a guest is surely home and home sweet home for there the heart can rest
255257 when christ receives a soul into his love he puts upon him the ring of adoption adopted why then we are brothers and sisters to all the good of earth and heaven we have the family name and the family dress and the father looks down upon us robes us defends and blesses and the insignia of eternal glory is our coat of arms
255258 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
255259 if anyone says i love god and hates his brother he is a liar
255260 for what i am doing i do not understand for i am not practicing what i would like to do i do the very thing i hate
255261 the church of christ when it is functioning properly is the hope of the world
255262 paul and timothy servants of christ jesus to all the saints in christ jesus at philippi together with the overseers and deacons grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ
255263 stop loving this evil world and all that it offers you for when you love the world you show that you do not have the love of the father in you for the world offers only the lust for physical pleasure the lust for everything we see and the pride of our possessions these are not from the father they are from this evil world
255264 too many people forget that satan desires to sift us like wheat so he can steal slaughter kill and destroy us and everything that is good worldliness opens the door to all forms of evil in our personal life relationships and ministries
255265 set your thoughts on things above not on earthly things for you died and your life is now hidden with christ in god
255266 the kingdom of heaven like a mustard seed that someone sowed in his field it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches

255268 the court has ascertained that nevzlin organized a whole host of extremely serious crimes
255269 the decision of the court was written in advance by the kremlin and there is no surprise in this decision

255277 when you are thinking about decorating your dorm room jcpenney is not something that will come to the surface for young girls
255278 jcpenney wanted to find a new media engagement idea that was going to make some young girl say wow was that jcpenney
255279 we certainly want to position the dorm life brand as a relevant resource to these young adults as they graduate from high school and head off to college
255280 for many of them this is a first opportunity to define themselves among new college friends by their decorating and expression of personal style we want to be seen as a relevant contributor to a very exciting time in their lives
255281 any kind of undisclosed paid placement spells trouble for consumers the media and the marketing industry
255282 without full disclosure and transparency media lose credibility and their value as an unbiased source of information for consumers
255283 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
255284 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
255285 he looks as close to being 100 percent since before he got hurt
255286 we are still in the middle of a massive transformation
255287 the internet is still the only industry really thats growing in advertising revenue
255288 we also absolutely feel that we have to look out for whats best for shareholders
255289 the board and the management team have always said what is it that we can do best for our shareholders
255290 i want to make it absolutely clear to everyone that the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning
255291 we called the shots and we were deeply involved in every step
255292 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
255293 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
255294 and they pressed onward creating a way of life that many would come to call if not american certainly the defining fabric of the south and the midwest as well as the core character of the nations working class
255295 the senate race was already starting to replay itself with the same old oppo research being thrown back
255296 if we have no intention to pursue this theres no reason to be distracted by questions that are unrelated to the senate
255297 weve been doing that here in virginia for a while
255298 we did that with warner in 01 kaine in 05 and democratic legislative candidates in 07
255299 people in their mid 30s married with two children and two dogs professional families
255300 the last hope of the conservative interests in the united states
255301 had been overwhelmingly approved both in congress and at the polling booths
255302 conservative interests resorted to the courts starting literally thousands of actions to stay the governments hand
255303 the liberal justices themselves called their conservative colleagues arbitrary and madly unwise but while the liberals warned the conservatives laughed
255304 reimposing meaningful limits on federal power that could strike at the core of the regulatory state for the first time since the new deal
255305 justices could change the shape of laws governing the environment workplace health and safety anti discrimination and civil rights making it difficult for the federal government to address problems for which the public demands a national response
255306 we will support our president and we will support our troops
255307 should never have been authorized and should never have been waged
255308 the only way we lose this election is not to engage this issue head on
255309 the case against mccain and bush on national security is so overwhelming it should be an essential part of the case for the democratic nominee
255310 i could not fathom that they would do what they did under the circumstances they did it
255311 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
255312 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
255313 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
255314 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
255315 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
255316 everyone will be a little happy even if no one will get everything they want
255317 it does not bode well for our convention or our unity
255318 im inclined to support the clinton position but thats not a carte blanche
255319 i think people want a sense of what the end is going to look like
255320 weve got to take time we need a little more time
255321 we havent turned any corners we havent seen any lights at the end of the tunnel the champagne bottle has been pushed to the back of the refrigerator
255322 too many fathers have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men
255323 you and i know how true this is in the african american community
255324 we know that more than half of all black children live in single parent households a number that has doubled doubled since we were children
255325 be there for their children and set high expectations for them and instill in them a sense of excellence and empathy
255326 struggled at times to pay the bills to give us the things that other kids had to play all the roles that both parents are supposed to play
255327 youre going to see house to house combat for these votes
255328 the thing democrats are counting on nationally doesnt work here they cant turn him into george bushs third term
255329 new hampshire looked at george bush eight years ago and john mccain eight years ago and understood there was a difference
255330 there was nothing we could tell them that they didnt know
255331 i spoke to a lot of independent voters who said im going to vote for obama or mccain
255332 theyd say theyre both straight talkers they both want to bring people together theyre both honest
255333 the reality is that in january mccain came in third place
255334 the republican brand has been so badly damaged that if republicans try to run an anti obama anti reverend wright or if senator clinton wins anti clinton campaign they are simply going to fail
255335 the same names and labels they always pin on everyone who doesnt agree with all their ideas the same efforts to distract us from the issues that affect our lives by pouncing on every gaffe and association and fake controversy in the hopes that the media will play along
255336 a vote for don cazayoux is a vote for barack obama and
255337 if don tax you gets to washington hell do what they tell him to do
255338 there was a lot of political and partisan decision making in the office
255339 you took resources from some programs and gave them to others without clear criteria for why the funds were shifted
255340 i realize this is going to be a sensitive issue in some circumstances in very narrow circumstances i think
255341 i certainly think that theres greater openness among evangelical leaders to begin discussions with democrats and listening to viewpoints that are not narrowly defined by the religious right
255342 we won together the swing states necessary to get to 270 electoral votes
255343 who will be the strongest candidate and the strongest president who will be ready to take back the white house and take charge as commander in chief and lead our country to better tomorrows
255344 to the 18 million people who voted for me and to our many other supporters out there of all ages i want to hear from you
255345 i hope youll go to my web site at and share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can
255346 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not
255347 and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
255348 believe that freedom from responsibility is selfishness freedom from sacrifice is cowardice freedom from tolerance is prejudice freedom from stewardship is exploitation and freedom from compassion is cruelty
255349 either by mere gross materialism or by mere silly sentimentalism above all we cannot meet it if we attempt to balance gross materialism in action by silly sentimentalism in words
255350 recognize the fact that his business activities while beneficial to himself and his associates must also justify themselves by being beneficial to the men who work for him and to the public which he serves
255351 i have no doubt that in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
255352 loving your country shouldnt just mean watching fireworks on the fourth of july loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it
255353 let me tell you what it was like to be young to be an american and to be asked

255363 were a conservative community and were just trying to make our students more reflective of that
255364 it is an additional option to allow us to keep kids in the educational classroom
255365 i dont think that jumpsuits are going to work because my friends actually instead of it being a punishment theyll see it as an opportunity to be like rebels
255366 i dont think theres going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school
255367 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
255368 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety
255369 the jumpsuits may be just as distracting as the clothing theyre replacing
255370 because ssbs can by definition browse to only one website many of the web based attacks against users phishing cross site scripting cross site request forgery wont work
255371 a great way to brand a website and keep users safer all at the same time
255372 i contend that we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race
255373 an estimated 5 million people have access to appropriate healthcare globally thanks to revenues from diamonds
255374 i believe de beers are so neck deep in this they are even editing stories in wikipedia
255375 we couldnt find that mccain has any position on cybersecurity they just taught him how to watch the drudge report how can you expect a guy who has never used a pc to understand cybersecurity
255376 a generation out of date on current technology and important related issues
255377 you hear me you little ones mind what dicey tells you you hear
255378 mostly garages and small shopping centers and discount stores and quick food places there were no green patches and few sidewalks
255379 it takes different things to make me glad like knowing weve got food the ocean and lots of room outdoors but mostly the ocean and the food too
255380 cousin eunices house wasnt free it was expensive and the price was always remembering to be grateful
255381 we dont have to go anywhere we could always travel like this following the warm weather like will said he did we can take care of ourselves
255382 northern ireland has made remarkable progress over the past decade
255383 the fact that there has been such progress is down in no small measure to the considerable contribution made by daniel and john in helping us to achieve a climate of understanding and a brighter future for all in northern ireland
255384 both men have been true friends to the people of northern ireland and loyal supporters of the peace process
255385 i congratulate both men on receiving these awards which are richly deserved
255386 i used to be really thin but now find myself toting around an extra 23 30 40 pounds of unwanted flub
255387 i was a little hefty to begin with and am now the physical equivalent of fat bastard
255388 if they come and arrest me on friday theyll lock me up when they chuck the food through the cell door ill chuck it back at them and i shall not eat anything or drink anything
255389 my team has worked doubly hard through the last several months to try to avoid this situation
255390 weve even gone to the extent of showing alternative properties to them
255391 all along the line weve been trying to give good advice and support them through this difficult time
255392 all my insecurities are breakin me up inside you light another cigarette and my eyes are on fire lightning strikes me only in waves and i know im safe for now but i know the rest is on its way
255393 if you return a computer to us without fail it will go out to a school many corporations like that
255394 used computers have potential problems a hard drive can fail or lcd monitor can go bad but we have only a 1 4 percent failure rate for our refurbished computers
255395 this job saved my life by the grace of god
255396 this man pointing to ford gave me an opportunity and trusted me with the keys to his facility
255397 schools spend billions of dollars on computers were one of their biggest suppliers so its a very fragmented market
255398 our leasing business is growing 10 percent to 20 percent a year ise grew 78 percent last year on top of 65 percent and 67 percent growth
255399 the special rapporteur wishes to engage in a constructive dialogue with the authorities with a view to improving the human rights situation of the people of myanmar
255400 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
255401 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
255402 that is why we are talking to pakistan thats why we are carrying on these conversations
255403 its a jigsaw puzzle we have some of the pieces the pieces that we have i told you where they lead
255404 i was incredibly interested in the combination of structural coherence and a content that kept transgressing distending through the force of what was being said of the physical moment being opened up the conceptual membranes of the writers identity a figuration linked with cross cultural trajectories
255405 appeared faintly behind the tinted glass of the vehicle as he waved
255406 okay and what plans does he have i was told there was a tent set up at the house is there a family event a wedding whats going on
255407 his mom and dad are here his brothers his brother and sister i believe will be here as well at least one brother that i know of
255408 and theyll spend some time getting together theyll hopefully be outside if it doesnt rain and spend some time in his last summer that the president is president of the united states
255409 we see a tent outside at the presidents fathers home
255410 the couple getting married is chris ellis and rachel williams
255411 rachel williams you may remember was a press assistant in our office and now works for ed gillespie
255412 chris ellis is the presidents grand nephew is that right
255413 there are far fewer britons which means no rapes no accidents no drunken debauchery no going on the rampage
255414 if melinda had any information nancy grace stopped the investigation in its track
255415 el dolor en la vida de una persona no cambia
255416 some political interests can indeed be served by such a measure and innocents between eight and eighty years of age can certainty be sent behind bars
255417 the attitude of prakash karat with regard to the role of the speaker is extremely shameful he kept on saying from the beginning that the speaker would take his own decision but alongside quietly he kept on sending his messengers so that orders could be passed on to the speaker if karat really wanted somnath chatterjee to take the decision himself there was no sense in expelling him from the party
255418 if somnath chatterjee in his capacity as speaker of lok sabha considers himself above party line he cannot be faulted for this anyway at least in this context there has been a glorious history of parliament and no speaker has ever been accused of acting under the influence of his party
255419 legally there is no problem in chatterjee remaining in the speakers chair but morally he may have to face the question as to how can he hold his post that he achieved as the representative of the party that has expelled him
255420 accusations and counter accusations were being hurled all over but this episode wads of currency notes being shown was seen by the entire world and our democracy was stripped before the world
255421 obviously rebellion at such a big scale would not have been for free
255422 even a slight glimpse of the tape or let the people listen to the voice of any of the accused persons
255423 im not sure whether gujral can make his wife vote for him

255467 many people have argued that having a legitimate hypervisor installed prevents installation of virtualization based malware we will show that this is not the case

255526 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
255527 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
255528 frankly as rollouts go i so would have like to see this go way differently and way better

255536 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that be without a lawyer
255537 he was just such an amazing guy he had a great personality
255538 he never cared for sitting around unless it was for a weekend with the guys playing risk he was always big on travelling he didnt like to sit in one place

255558 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
255559 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
255560 the scientific community is really going to run with this
255561 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

255564 the objections to religion are of two sorts intellectual and moral the intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow

255583 jonathan chait theda skocpol on tpm and eugene robinson are all calling for obama to go after mccain with some attack ads of his own why not hammer mccain with his many goofy bush like policy proposals verbal gaffes and lies
255584 a key question is whether obama will finally launch a caustic television ad perhaps aimed at hillarys war vote
255585 just because a group of voters values bipartisanship doesnt mean they respect weakness in this respect obama has been eclipsed by the warrior clinton for much of the race
255586 my pioneer dvr 420hs has an analog tuner thus when the digital transition kicks in the tuner on my dvd recorder will no longer work most dvd recorders out there right now have analog tuners so they will all be obsolete

255588 the special rapporteur wishes to engage in a constructive dialogue with the authorities with a view to improving the human rights situation of the people of myanmar
255589 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
255590 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
255591 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
255592 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
255593 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
255594 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
255595 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
255596 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
255597 you are bound when you are developing new technology to have some engineering problems and some people have had them but i am sure we will get on top of them
255598 to make the system work from the start of next year is going to be very challenging
255599 but people will make it work and we will get on top of the technology and we will develop better and lighter battery solutions mechanical solutions because that is the pace of development in f1
255600 so it is just an engineering challenge and we will get on top of it
255601 each of us has it clear in our minds what the risks are of carrying fuel in the car but in terms of batteries generally we dont have a lot of common experience so we are looking at these things as they can have all sorts of problems or risks
255602 it will be common engineering practice to be sure that we put safe things on the car so it will be hard work but we are confident that we can do the job
255603 regarding safety we are doing everything to make sure that the system is safe
255604 the car that we used in jerez we also used it for a shakedown just to run it for a few kilometres to be safe that everything is working
255605 but it seems that not everything was perfect so we are investigating it with a lot of experts to find out what happened
255606 regarding using kers or not first we have to see in the car what is the actual performance gain because there is this extra power from the kers systems but theres also more weight or less ballast on this car so it will always be a trade off but the plan is to race this system
255607 i think all the formula 1 teams are taking the safety aspect very very seriously
255608 you have to remember that first the system has to be managed on the bench in house in testing so the safety aspect is the first priority you cannot use a system in house on the test bench a system that you believe is not safe enough or in testing
255609 safety of course is the first aspect i dont think anyone would use a system in the race that they dont believe is safe
255610 in terms of when it should be decided whether to use the kers or not in a race this is still very early days
255611 we think there is potential we think we can have a performance advantage so we will push in that direction and at the very last moment if the whole package is faster we will use it
255612 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
255613 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
255614 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
255615 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
255616 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money
255617 i understand what yao said but im still ghetto im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture
255618 he said some real nice things i really appreciate it it was nice of him
255619 disrespecting me chip in a drawer at home he has a chance to simultaneously stiffen his new team and refurbish his reputation if on the other hand artest persists with his fourth nba team now in pressing play on an endless loop of
255620 whether im right or whether im wrong whether i find a place in this world or never belong
255621 cognitive dissonance when writing about the undue attention paid to the balance of power between the two conferences noting that it is a
255622 i made a mistake the suitcase was supposed to fall in the river if it had fallen in the river nobody would have found it as they havent found the head and the other parts
255623 while the company believes the weak economy and ailing consumer confidence were the primary factors hemming in member application growth we remain concerned that market sizing issues or competition could also be partly to blame
255624 as in the case with cfo tom wurtzs announced departure just a week ago we suspect the departure likely reflects bob steel electing to put his own inner circle of senior executives in place in order to help implement the battle plan for overhauling wachovia
255625 we suspect an outside candidate will be preferable someone with no ties to wachovias culture or existing problems who can come in and be totally objective in helping mr steel assess the problems and recommend swift action
255626 gfi did a good job controlling expenses especially in light of departures and guidance for 3rd quarter was better than expected in our view
255627 we see gfi as a cheaper way to play the strong volume seen in the derivatives market
255628 we believe that sales at the department stores were lackluster owing to the lack of fashion newness and a challenging macro environment
255629 i know that water pong seems like a good balance between the dartmouth drinking culture and just trying to have fun
255630 however it can be just as dangerous if not more so
255631 foul language rowdy and disorderly behavior and to examples of the consumption of alcohol under circumstances that are detrimental
255632 biggest pet peeve i dont even know what the fuck that means
255633 we have to go forward and one of the things that we are proudest of is the letters that we get from these students
255634 we really can help to fulfil their dreams and its so wonderful that we didnt want to say we cannot do it this year so we are doing the best we can
255635 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
255636 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
255637 tonight the vietnamese team had a good match the weather tonight was nice and i liked this match very much
255638 im happy with the match although we had little training we would like to thank vietnamese fans and the hosts for giving us a warm welcome and good preparation
255639 having the brazilian players in vietnam is a once in a lifetime event
255640 its a great opportunity to see ronaldinho pato and anderson
255641 im very surprised about the warm welcome and the enthusiasm from the vietnamese fans for soccer i will have a lot of things to tell my friends back home
255642 there are many young players who have a lot of experience and i think that will make the difference for us
255643 we have let many chances of gold slip many good teams have played the olympics and we have never managed to win it now we have the opportunity we have a very good team
255644 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
255645 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
255646 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
255647 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
255648 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
255649 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
255650 we do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard
255651 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
255652 actually obama is a serious trustworthy candidate whose relevant qualifications are x y and z and whose consistent record of experienced leadership will accomplish 1 2 and 3
255653 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
255654 wouldnt have been seen as playing the race card if davis hadnt issued this release
255655 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
255656 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
255657 i am confident i will get her votes if im the nominee its not clear she would get the votes i got if she were the nominee
255658 anyone who has ever belonged to a book group must read this book
255659 its always nice to be recognized but im more concerned about where we finish the season and the process that it takes to get there
255660 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
255661 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
255662 es un negocio muy lucrativo pero los cient ficos advierten que de continuar a este ritmo la demanda no ser sostenible
255663 es momento de unir no de dividir no es hora de quedarnos en el pasado sino de mirar hacia el futuro
255664 desterremos el pasamonta as y la ocultaci n de identidad como medio intimidante
255665 cuando el actual gobierno asumi se requer a una cosecha para equiparar el gasto p blico ahora se necesitan por lo menos tres cosechas
255666 new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
255667 not one person in my neighborhood has a building permit
255668 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
255669 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
255670 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
255671 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
255672 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
255673 most demolitions are of multi story buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
255674 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
255675 it was an eye opener to realize that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
255676 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone
255677 its happened to my children four times its cruelty beyond words
255678 we are very pleased to have signed a confidential rail transport agreement with qns amp l an outstanding and well recognized rail transporter this agreement will ensure long term access to the worlds largest consumers of iron ore for our future high quality product the signing of this rail transport agreement also marks a significant milestone in the development of the bloom lake property
255679 we are delighted with investor interest in the companys projects and a successful first close despite a challenging time in the capital markets the company is now well positioned with over 8 million in cash to advance the work programs on its priority projects in quebec
255680 kids are starving in india and youre walking around with a sombrero full of peanuts
255681 theres also my visitor she could be from tintuum or maybe even from the band though i doubt that why would she want me to find her if she was already part of the band
255682 we thought she might be from spoy plenty of people have been lost to that stone over the years maybe one of them has found a way to reach out to the guardian
255683 dont feel right to me that thought i saw no mark on the band near spoy when i last looked
255684 its making quite a dent in the flesh now as if it wants to sink towards the bone
255685 i dont remember it doing that before but then most wosiq dont go round wearing it why did you do that kal
255686 ive always worn it bull wore it too according to my hosts memories and spar was wearing it when me and falc went to visit her
255687 they may have been driven to it are you sure youve worn it before
255688 ive only been the guardian three times and that first time i didnt even know what i was carrying not until grussa tried to turn me insane
255689 first as a pendant hung over my chest with string but when grussa pushed me too far i kept hold of it in my fist then once id bested her it changed shape turned into a sort of arm band so i wore it like that
255690 it was shaped as a ring then i wore it on my finger
255691 if shes managed it shes done a superb job those are good memories even if they might be false
255692 that sounds suspicious he dont look at it rub it even he must be feeling something the way its tight on his thumb
255693 maybe she hides in one mind most of the time and swaps over only when needed
255694 what else have you two scribbled down on your paper
255695 how much do we really know about them how certain can we be that they dont see us
255696 say if a vampire host became aware of his rider like kals host has or like kal did with grussa your new friend hes a vampire who knows what hes doing what if someone like him survived the hosting with knowledge of us
255697 rule is you always render from a vampire host by making sure it dies
255698 thats our rule yes but were not the only band in the world
255699 i was there but theres other stuff too maybe one of the powers is here in the outer world could that be causing the fear
255700 powers have stayed put since the loss of fol huun
255701 they dont need our help to come through for all i know they probably dont need a host while theyre here
255702 we would know it if one of them was here the powers arent shy kal they wouldnt see the need to hide from us
255703 theyd just use us heh same as ever powers is powers they do as they see fit
255704 they used to maybe but this is a different world a different order of knowledge and intelligence us monkeys were tricky nowadays
255705 this fear its in my guts and my joints its in the whiff of the wind and the damp of the rain its everywhere if it was a power doing this then id be able to locate it east or north or something a power has to be somewhere a location none of them can be everywhere at once they arent gods
255706 to describe what has happened virtually overnight in logan square a neighborhood north of the loop as gentrification is to miss the point chicago like much of america is rearranging itself and the result is an entire metropolitan area that looks considerably different from what it looked like when this decade started
255707 there are responsible critics who argue that in absolute numbers the return to the urban center remains a minor demographic event they have a point but even if the critics are mostly right there is no doubt that a demographic inversion in which the rich are moving inside and the poor are moving outside is taking place the crucial issue is not the number of people living downtown although that matters the crucial issue is who they are and the ways in which urban life is changing as a result
255708 take note of 3 things that made me happy am proud of or thankful for
255709 der dateityp xy mp4 wird von diesem ger t nicht unterst zt
255710 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
255711 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
255712 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
255713 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
255714 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
255715 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
255716 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
255717 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
255718 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
255719 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
255720 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
255721 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
255722 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
255723 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading the huffington post
255724 det er os der g r vi med pote og kl r
255725 directed filmed and produced in the uk with a hugely talented and largely british cast and crew it is particularly fitting that this warner brothers film will help raise funds to support those from the british film and television community most in need
255726 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
255727 wind power is clean its renewable its everything you want and its a stable supply of energy its unbelievable that we have not done more with wind
255728 there was never a conversation in more than 30 board meetings that did not involve shareholder value
255729 in my opinion carl icahn knows less about computers than i do why let him run it rather than the founder of the company
255730 icahn has his point but i am pleased he didnt replace the entire board
255731 dark hair preferably kind of tall who likes coldplay and plays the guitar
255732 eighteen is just a little too old its kind of illegal
255733 id do it anyone we like or respect no matter how different they may be we would play with
255734 shes doing something quite different i just think she seems to have a sweet character
255735 of somebody at my age of 63 wanting to learn one of the hardest languages
255736 somebodys appreciating their culture and thats the reason why people are so happy about the record
255737 if a foreigner likes it then we should like it
255738 if they buy two dozen ill sing them a song in guarani
255739 i dont want to lose guarani ive invested 3 1 2 years in it
255740 the current system of classification comes from a time when video games were in their infancy
255741 the widespread recognition of the bbfcs classification categories in the uk and their statutory backing offer significant advantages which the pegi system lacks
255742 the pegi ratings system is the only one that truly protects children understands the interactive nature of rating games and is the only system endorsed by the games industry
255743 it offers a strict classification system based on international standards and detailed criteria which is scalable and robust enough to cope with rating the explosion of gaming content
255744 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
255745 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
255746 you were lucky to have been born in the united states of america
255747 how are we now supposed to negotiate with the british energy board after the way it has behaved
255748 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement
255749 i think it would have been a good fit its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
255750 a development by acquisition is not an end in itself it is one of the means to reach our targets and it is conditional on being welcome in a country where a deal can be done
255751 we have to go forward and one of the things that we are proudest of is the letters that we get from these students
255752 we really can help to fulfill their dreams and its so wonderful that we didnt want to say we cannot do it this year so we are doing the best we can
255753 aviation has always bailed me out of anything in my mind that is blue
255754 i can look through an airline schedule and brochure and cheer up
255755 thats how crazy i am about it if i can look out the bedroom and see the planes i am happy
255756 maybe if john travolta or harrison ford is interested in this maybe its something for me
255757 thats really the bigger purpose is to get the young people interested in aviation again and the aerospace industry

255780 hey we cant help the fact that a crazy person latched onto what weve been telling people to do for years because of course sane people would know that we didnt really mean it
255781 these are the times of violence and hatred those who call on gods name i know i know universalists dont follow orthodoxy but the gunman didnt know that are on the front line because we call people to change we tell them that they are sinners in the grasp of sin and must change or face damnation we tell them that their efforts just arent good enough yet we also tell them that there is a way to eternal life with almighty god we tell them and hopefully show them as well his peace joy and lovingkindness we offer reconciliation with god a family that will never go away so why the hate they hate because they must they are confronted by what lives within them and if they dont submit that ugly place inside them to the light of christ which brings them true life for the very first time then the sin takes over and they act on it this is what was foretold and it will get worse still our weapons are not the weapons the world uses we stand by the power of the spirit of god and his love is stronger than their hate his love can turn an enemy into a brother

255885 the most damning piece of evidence the remnants of the previous security border
255886 its been a long day sunday starting off with my jumping the gun several times and in opposite directions
255887 as can clearly be seen the outside edge of the decosta colbs right border indicated by the red arrow falls well short of the red line drawn where techdude says the outside edge of the phantom border is located
255888 i dont have my birth certificate and i dont know where it is
255889 whats on the birth certificate that someone might not want the public to see
255890 the thinner lines used in the 2007 colb would have been an experiment that seemed like a good idea at the time but later abandoned because of the impossibility of getting good solid black diagonal lines especially against a coloured background

255892 the thinner lines used in the 2007 colb would have been an experiment that seemed like a good idea at the time but later abandoned because of the impossibility of getting good solid black diagonal lines especially against a coloured background
255893 short version ray you need a better expert just from where i sit here youre uncomfortable with the scientific results so youre squirming but the results seem pretty solid to me
255894 techdude posted segments of the borders and the segment from the kos image clearly showed a pattern of 2 darker lines followed by a lighter line repeated at regular intervals unless k can demonstrate that the pattern of alternating darker and lighter lines are actually an artifact of my display screen or can demonstrate that theyre an artifact of how the image was digitally reproduced for the screen then techdudes evidence is not only present but convincing on its face the pattern can be seen with the naked eye
255895 you could almost look at vegas as the incubator of a whole host of surveillance technologies
255896 the spread of the techniques to counterterrorism is doubly worrisome finding a terrorist is much harder than finding a card counter and the consequences of being wrongly labeled a terrorist are much more severe than being excluded from a casino

255900 we often hear of the surveillance technology du jour but what were seeing now in america is a collection of surveillance technologies that work together
255901 it isnt just video surveillance or face recognition or license plate readers or rfid chips its that all these technologies are converging to create a surveillance society
255902 the only people who have anything to worry about are the people who have something to hide
255903 its all about gathering personal information which im not so crazy about the government knowing its none of their business
255904 whats the big deal michele screwed up when she scanned the colb so what
255905 some minor variations on the minute angle of the images
255906 this morning i started to look more into the font kerning issue which techdude illustrated in a number of animated gif files and in doing so stumbled upon something well something rather interesting the michele colb appears to have some sort of aspect ratio distortion i took a cue from elliewyatt and decided to start by matching the green basketweave pattern of the background i pulled in the michele colb and then overlaid the obama colb and set it to about 50 transparency i zoomed in on the center of the image and used that point to line up the pattern however i noticed that as i scrolled up and down and left and right the patterns didnt match up nearly as well at all i found this strange as the michele colb i had was a 300 dpi image same as the obama image so i decided to brute force it i separately adjusted the image width and height until i had a good alignment of the pattern over the entire page heres an image of the alignment left to right
255907 it would be quite easy in some programs to alter the percentage of one area of the text fields without touching the others in a quality program one could alter the spacing between the individual letters as well if required
255908 fathers race the kos version was set in a larger font for the word
255909 the kos overall depth before reduction from the top of
255910 we do have witnesses who have assured us that the obama colb is the same as others of the same version
255911 slightly undersized paper interesting that the white space is essentially equal all the way around the image in both the michele and obama images how did both documents manage to get centered so precisely as to have the same amount of white space around them
255912 its your turn to produce a kos clone and tell us how it was done naturally its your turn to provide the visual evidence its your turn to take the heat
255913 well i have created the kos clone i and nobody else i did what you asked of me i know how the kos was made
255914 meanwhile theres lots of evidence against it being real and trying to denigrate the negative research does nothing to validate it
255915 critics like aj ray and yourself have been asking me to prove that the kos image is a fake while at the same time clamoring for me and techdude to make a kos clone to demonstrate how it was made
255916 forgery matches none of the other as on that image but all of the others match one another
255917 forgery matches none of the other ms on that image but all of the others match one another
255918 it was never intended to be something to be passed off as a fake
255919 essentially what youre saying is that in the graphics program the text is in
255920 but whats the stretch if you dont increase the kos image to 101
255921 i took a good size horizontal section of the background from the obama image up above the printed area and just copied it five times from top to bottom to create a full blank page of the background pattern
255922 when you said that the first fake was too straight i laser printed the filled in template on plain white paper and then scanned it
255923 60 and using a very sharp pencil changed them to very convincing 54s effectively making me 21 years old
255924 we had a newsroom colleague bring in her own hawaii birth certificate to see if it looks the same its identical

255928 i went down to dmv handed the lady at the window my old id card told her what id done back when i was 15 and said i wanted to get a drivers license with my real birth year on it
255929 i dont know that its possible for us to even say beyond a doubt what the image on the site represents
255930 even say beyond a doubt what the image on the site represents
255931 when we looked at that image you guys sent us our registrar he thought he could see pieces of the embossed image through it
255932 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
255933 claim the embossed seal size on the obama colb is smaller than the embossed seal on the michele colb
255934 its not a very good image for comparative purposes as the obama seal is not only offset from the reference seals
255935 the panel with the obama seal actually cuts off a portion of the bottom of the seal though this isnt immediately obvious
255936 el seems to feel that the embossed seal on the obama colb is smaller than that of the michele colb
255937 in the image here i have lined up the basket weave patterns on micheles on both sides with obamas for accurate size scale they are not lined up vertically because of needing to match the weave pattern http s283 photobucket com albums kk287 elliewyatt action view amp current 3seals jpg are they the same size obs appears smaller to me but im not sure it was quite obvious with decostas but i cant tell here
255938 i noticed that the alignment of the diamond shapes on the side borders of bos cert are not the same the diamonds on the left border are centered but the pattern on the right border was shifted off center to the left so i traced the lines and colored them
255939 el i went ahead and mocked up all the seals by doing what i described
255940 elliewyatt july 19 2008 at 2 30 pm ksdb thank you for that work i think it is excellent i think at least seal size issue can be put to rest

255981 had caused such a negative impact in many parts of the communion
255982 although there has been a great appreciation of one to one conversation there is the need to develop further trust in the relationships that have started here
255983 full visible communion as the aim of our dialogue has receded further
255984 that even in the midst of difficult circumstances you have sought the views and perspectives of your ecumenical partners even when you have not always particularly rejoiced in what we have said
255985 what we are talking about is nothing other than faithfulness to christ himself
255986 not only a disciplinary position but an expression of our faithfulness to jesus christ
255987 effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
255988 the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate is not only a matter of isolated provinces but that this is increasingly the stance of the communion

255993 strong and vocal stands in favor of impeaching president bush and vice president cheney
255994 in the eyes of the right wing i am seen along with rep kucinich as one of the symbols of the impeachment fight they believe that if they defeat me they defeat our cause

255997 i saw firsthand the damage hurricane dolly inflicted upon south texas so this announcement is certainly an important step forward in helping those affected by the storm receive much needed relief im also pleased residents in cameron hidalgo and willacy counties have been approved for individual assistance in which homeowners can directly receive aid for recovery efforts there is still important work to do i have and will continue to do all i can on the federal level to ensure appropriate and necessary resources are allocated to south texas families businesses and communities i will also work with fema the counties and residents to make sure funding moves expeditiously
255998 twenty years ago 21 of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery today oil speculators purchase 66 of all oil futures contracts and that reflects just the transactions that are known speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as 30 to 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs
255999 might want to in your thank you to inhofe for his assistance in helping encourage usage of city plex for fema and any govt office
256000 figured out how to get the lights and microphones back on
256001 senator obama and i faced a decision which amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
256002 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
256003 thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
256004 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative city and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
256005 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
256006 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
256007 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
256008 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
256009 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
256010 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
256011 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
256012 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
256013 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
256014 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
256015 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
256016 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
256017 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
256018 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
256019 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
256020 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more

256022 comcast was delaying subscribers downloads and blocking their uploads it was doing so 24 7 regardless of the amount of congestion on the network or how small the file might be
256023 even worse comcast was hiding that fact by making affected users think there was a problem with their internet connection or the application today the commission tells comcast to stop
256024 the commission rejected comcasts defense that its practice constitutes reasonable network management
256025 while comcast claimed that it was motivated by a desire to combat network congestion the commission concluded that the companys practices are ill tailored to serve that goal for many reasons they affect customers who are using little bandwidth simply because they are using a disfavored application they are not employed only during times of the day when congestion is prevalent the companys equipment does not target only those neighborhoods suffering from congestion and a customer may use an extraordinary amount of bandwidth during periods of network congestion and will be totally unaffected so long as he does not utilize an application disfavored by comcast

256035 there appears to be an effort by the federal government to coerce states into exempting their fusion centers from state open government laws

256047 cant say with a straight face that this isnt about eliminating the right to gay marriage so whats their problem with this this is a political lawsuit not one about serious legal issues

256099 a normal person who does insane things on the internet
256100 do you know how many ive killed at his command
256101 hacks like this tell you to watch out by hitting you with a baseball bat
256102 demonstrating these kinds of exploits is usually the only way to get them fixed
256103 so the message is buy a helmet and the medium is a bat to the head
256104 no its like a pitcher telling a batter to put on his helmet by beaning him from the mound if you have this disease and youre on the internet you need to take precautions
256105 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
256106 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
256107 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
256108 you seem to know exactly how much you can get away with and you troll right up to that line
256109 is there anything that can be done on the internet that shouldnt be done

256111 plankton levels are dropping bees are dying there are tortilla riots in mexico the highest wheat prices in 30 odd years
256112 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
256113 we need someone to show us the way the messiah
256114 loki was a hacker the other gods feared him but they needed his tools
256115 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
256116 while drews conduct is immoral it is a very big stretch to call it illegal
256117 people know to be deeply skeptical of what they read on the front of a supermarket tabloid
256118 it should be even more so with anonymous comments they shouldnt start off with a credibility rating of say 0 it should be more like negative 30
256119 but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help
256120 allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around zach asked if i thought i could turn my parents around i almost broke down the idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that i could actually be proud of it was overwhelming
256121 its not that i do this because i hate them i do this because im trying to save them
256122 ultimately the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards
256123 what makes a bad person or a good person how do you know if youre a bad person
256124 a good person is someone who follows the rules a bad person is someone who doesnt
256125 there is no morality only the right of the superior to rule over the inferior
256126 were going to turn into wormchow before the rest of the universe even notices
256127 there was no place in the land where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity for the slave no place in all the land but one the pulpit it yielded last it always does it fought a strong and stubborn fight and then did what it always does joined the procession at the tail end slavery fell the slavery texts in the bible remained the practice changed that was all
256128 they said god was on high and he controlled the world and therefore we must pray against satan well if god controls the world he controls satan for me religion was full of misstatements and reaches of logic that i just couldnt agree with
256129 the patient typically finds himself impelled by some deep inner conviction that something is true or right or virtuous a conviction that doesnt seem to owe anything to evidence or reason but which nevertheless he feels as totally compelling and convincing we doctors refer to such a belief as faith
256130 i am patient with stupidity but not with those who are proud of it
256131 everyone seems to be liking the same race tire so the race tire is pretty good we were out there the whole session on the same one that we had on this morning just to get as many laps on it as possible and then with about eight minutes on the clock we put a little bit softer tire on and went a little bit quicker but the race tire is pretty good its capable of running mid fours pretty comfortably with a tire with race laps on it looks okay at the moment
256132 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies

256140 consumers believe that retailers like wal mart know the quality and safety of products they sell
256141 retailers benefit from that trust and must be held accountable for the products they sell
256142 consumers believe that retailers like wal mart know the quality and safety of products they sell
256143 retailers benefit from that trust and must be held accountable for the products they sell
256144 what it does is it takes a very difficult and confusing process and makes it easier for people to understand
256145 theyre really providing a value to people to understand whats going on even though its not the prettiest site to look at it seems to meet the needs of its users and thats what it comes done to meeting customers needs
256146 theyve done a good job in understanding what the people who visit the fbi are looking for
256147 it comes down to knowing what your users want and getting it to them in an easy straightforward fashion
256148 e government has stopped the bleeding for now in terms of citizen satisfaction but it remains to be seen if this is a blip or the beginning of a positive trend
256149 what is evidently clear however is that improving online satisfaction can drive traffic to the web channel investment in the online channel will pay itself off and result in increased efficiency and happy citizens
256150 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
256151 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
256152 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
256153 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
256154 whether it is cost effective in certain populations of women colonized with group b streptococci to be re screened or just treated in a subsequent pregnancy will have to be determined
256155 should be considered in the algorithm for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis
256156 are not advocating the abandonment of the cdc recommendations for antepartum screening
256157 the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
256158 pot is still better but this sh ts pretty good pretty soon well have something thats just like marijuana only legal

256162 that the defendants plot although disturbing and audacious was one that they intended to carry out and not as they have suggested in their pretrial papers merely loose talk
256163 asked by a democratic lawmaker a while back why there weren t more democrats in the military rafael enrique valero
256164 i f there is a significant num ber of documented aliens aliens in ins records on the orange county voter registration rolls how many illegal or undocumented aliens may be regis tered to vote in orange county
256165 register to vote so that they can obtain documents identifying them as u s citizens
256166 used their voters cards to obtain a myriad of benefits from social security to jobs with the de fense department
256167 respond to an inquiry by a federal state or local government agency seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose autho rized by law by providing the requested verification or status information
256168 it is important to safeguard the confidentiality of each legal immigrant especially in light of the federal privacy act and the immigration and nationality act
256169 want to open a pandoras box if word got out that this is a substantial problem it could tie up all sorts of manpower there might be a few thou sand illegal voters in dallas for example but there could be tens of thousands in places like new york chicago or miami
256170 there is no way of check ing we have no access to any information about who is in the united states legally or otherwise
256171 revealed phony addresses and large numbers of registrants who admitted they were not u s citi zens
256172 and told that she was not to ask that question only whether the person wished to register to vote
256173 she then reapplied in 1997 again claiming to be a u s citizen and was again given a voter card which was again cancelled records show she was able to vote at least four times in general and primary elections
256174 elections decided by one two or just a handful of votes
256175 from a relatively small universe of individuals legal immigrants who seek to become citizens these numbers do not tell us how many illegal immigrants have regis tered and voted

256180 many people have argued that having a legitimate hypervisor installed prevents installation of virtualization based malware we will show that this is not the case
256181 years ago other vendors tried to downplay the importance of microsoft windows kernel rootkits saying that one needed to already be an administrator in order to install one as we know over the last couple of years kernel rootkits became a very serious security problem
256182 it is automatically created when the system boots and does a lot of the management of the system it builds all of the other user domains and manages all of their virtual devices
256183 the subverting techniques we will be presenting at black hat indeed assume that the attacker first obtained access to domain 0
256184 domain 0 being an administrative domain requires certain services to be run inside it one such service is an secure shell daemon this makes the attack surface on domain 0 quite large
256185 over the last year it has been shown that domain 0 is far from being bulletproof with our presentations we take the game to the new level by studying how to compromise the hypervisor and what we can do to prevent it
256186 we will show how to bypass those protections and subvert xen hypervisor memory
256187 were going to see how it is presented shes done some really cool stuff in the past but in this case i dont see this applying to all of xen
256188 most things that fall into those proportions are beautiful to the human eye

256190 its a style of music that lets you unwind and reflect
256191 its a challenge to make the music not too intrusive
256192 the more successful it is the less you notice it
256193 its like the music is being pushed into you its so anchored in you that when you play it again you relive the experience
256194 younger kids come to us and say that music makes me sleepy
256195 i say thats the best compliment in the world think about it when you are falling asleep you want to be in a really nice space where you feel secure safe and comfortable

256200 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
256201 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
256202 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

256209 so this is the beginning of a new era i guess
256210 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies

256236 its one of these things where youre trying to do something for public good and you have it interrupted by vandalism it doesnt make a lot of sense
256237 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
256238 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
256239 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
256240 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
256241 i think it started with dwight early in the game he got it going on the defensive end which led over to the offensive end once he holds it down in the middle like that we feed off of that
256242 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
256243 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him
256244 we have said if there is any proof of pakistans involvement we would like to see the proof of that because merely alleging something means nothing
256245 as far as i know and as far as we are informed the army has worked very hard to root any such elements out
256246 because as you know they were exposed to a very long engagement with the afghan resistance and those were really jihadis of a particular hardcore kind
256247 a lot of steam has been let out of the pressure cooker
256248 what is this world coming to will this ever end
256249 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
256250 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
256251 i am prepared to stay here as long as we can
256252 i think that is one hell of a performance for this management team considering what they been through the last six months
256253 there is no company on the internet that has this collection of assets

256257 allison i like to read the books i dont care about this stuff
256258 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
256259 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
256260 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
256261 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
256262 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
256263 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

256267 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phoney allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families

256279 it is an insult to my peoples faith to discuss the sharia in this forum
256280 plainly one can talk about a sneaking islamization into public life if it not an insult that one has to restrict oneself in order to live in peaceful coexistence between cultures
256281 various acts of barbarism to be practiced such as the stoning of adulteresses the public hanging of homosexuals and early marriages with child brides everything seemingly quite in line with the sharia
256282 they condemned zionism as equal with nazism and apartheid but also with the white rage which had attempted to create a holocaust of human trafficking slave trade and colonization in africa israel should disappear completely its politicians should appear in a nuremberg style court and be punished anti semitic caricatures were handed out copies of hitlers mein kampf were distributed along with the protocols of the elders of zion under a photo of hitler one could read that israel never existed and that the palestinians would not have payed with their blood if he had been victorious some delegates were threatened with violence and some shouted kill the jews the climax of this farce was the sudanese minister of justice ali mohamed osman yasin demanding damages for the slave trade while at the same time his own country shamelessly enslaves people
256283 the leading exponents of anti semitism be they against individual jews or the jewish state as such are once again given a global platform by the united nations
256284 it would be a farce if it wasnt so tragic
256285 anti racism in the un has become the ideology of totalitarian movements meant to advance their own agenda dictatorships or notorious half dictatorships libya pakistan iran saudi arabia algeria cuba venezuela and so on adapt to a democratic language and formal legislative standards to counter democracies without questions about themselves
256286 which endorses the idea of religious defamation in order to suppress any doubt especially in islamic countries
256287 a clear stance is needed in europe when confronted with this foul play boycott plain and simple just like canada decided
256288 that this lobby of fanatics and tyrants in 2008 like in the thirties contains specifically those nations who must be judged by history for not allowing multi party states and freedom of opinion
256289 democracy secularism and the defense of universal human rights against the intended cultural pluralism meant to defend the islamic sharia against individual freedom
256290 and the democracies have to stand up firmly against that
256291 according to this letter the performing license of the indonesian band debu led by kumayl mustafa daood is revoked
256292 it is another example of how rich people exploit and pollute the planet because of their money
256293 responsabilizamos a las fuerzas armadas colombianas en una forma de actuar que sigue se al ndose como son los ajusticiamientos extrajudiciales se asesina a personas civiles para vestirlas despu s de guerrilleros y sindicarlos como guerrilleros
256294 el hostigamiento de grupos guerrilleros o armados da lugar a bombardeos indiscriminados por parte del ej rcito y los grupos de civiles y las comunidades ind genas y campesinas se ven en medio del fuego cruzado y son los que acaban poniendo los muertos
256295 a los l deres estudiantiles y profesores se les est n haciendo se alamientos directos

256300 finally new yorkers can say stop the junk and have the force of the law behind them with the ability to file complaints directly against distributors
256301 the result will be cleaner streets more livable neighborhoods and less waste
256302 sustainable flatbush strongly supports the unsolicited materials law as part of our mission to promote sustainable living in flatbush brooklyn it is a prime example of thinking globally while acting locally we vocally oppose the waste of thousands of pounds of paper that unsolicited materials represent we call these materials junk litter and have to remove piles of flyers menus and advertising papers from our porches lobbies and front lawns no one should have the right to dump litter this way we hope that the businesses that promote this practice understand that they are not only wasting paper but are wasting money too
256303 people dont seem to suspect they have a dire need to understand crucial aspects of energy although we all cant be technical experts

256308 thats ok im a big boy now and i dont need it as much
256309 do not follow where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
256310 many a doctrine is like a window pane we see truth through it but it divides us from truth
256311 you cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness that created them
256312 the true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self we shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive
256313 we have sleeping beauties inside of us that are waiting to be recognized so that we may awaken to the truth of our existence and connection with all things
256314 if there were nothing but thought in you you wouldnt even know you are thinking you would be like a dreamer who doesnt know he is dreaming when you know you are dreaming you are awake within the dream once there is a certain degree of presence of still and alert attention in human beings perceptions they can sense the divine life essence the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature every life form recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves until this happens however most humans see only the outer forms unaware of the inner essence just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form
256315 what i can say is that we are going to hold to the no tights part of it
256316 for people wondering when clark is going to start embracing his destiny this is the year where he is going to be doing that more than ever
256317 we worked closely with smallville creators alfred gough and miles millar for many years and they shared with us their ideas for how the show would end when that time comes we hope that doesnt happen for some time but when it does happen i think that everyone in this room will be very happy we got some awesome ideas
256318 the cool thing is that were not trashing the doomsday back story were adding to it and interpreting it
256319 what were adding to it is the human consequence not just the human consequence of the people he victimizes but the human consequence for himself because hes actually a really nice guy
256320 with lex is missing tess is the new girl in charge at lexcorp and nobody knows why
256321 clark is going to actively go out and seek his destiny as superman and really take on the daily planet as his source of finding people that need his help
256322 they tend to stick pretty close to the comics but put a smallville tweak on it so if it happens its fine with me
256323 im going to be writing the episode im excited to work with everybody on this and the cast is amazing

256353 got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
256354 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
256355 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
256356 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
256357 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
256358 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
256359 hes not from central casting when it comes to presidents of the united states hes young hes new to washington yes hes african american

256437 the compact could be a great step forward to protect the great lakes
256438 however there are serious concerns with the exceptions laid out in the compact such as those allowing the packaging and sale of great lakes water as a product for private gain and explicitly exempting bottled water furthermore the compact fails to incorporate the public trust doctrine that protects great lakes basin waters from private export and sale and protects these waters from claims to the water as a product under international trade laws
256439 this was born out of the recognition that publicly owned natural resources are essential to meet the basic needs of all citizens and communities regardless of economic status
256440 but as long as the water is considered a product it establishes a precedent that water can be grabbed by profit hungry corporations who want to claim it is a product not subject to the compact
256441 there are those who argue that the compact is an acceptable compromise claiming that protecting 70 percent of our great lakes basin waters is good enough
256442 but anyone knows that a 30 percent hole or leak will result in a draining and serious impairment or diminishment of the water and fish in not only the great lakes but all of our inland lakes and streams
256443 i was at a deck party awhile back and the bugs were having a ball biting everyone a man at the party sprayed the lawn and deck floor with listerine and the little demons disappeared the next year i filled a 4 ounce spray bottle and used it around my seat whenever i saw mosquitoes and voila that worked as well it worked at a picnic where we sprayed the area around the food table the childrens swing area and the standing water nearby during the summer i dont leave home without it pass it on our friends comments i tried this on my deck and around all of my doors it works in fact it killed them instantly i bought my bottle from target and it cost me 1 89 it really doesnt take much and it is a big bottle too so it is not as expensive to use as the can of bug spray you buy that doesnt last 30 minutes so try this please it will last a couple of days dont spray directly on a wood door like your front door but spray around the frame spray around the window frames and even inside the dog house

256534 babies were not washed as they emerged from the womb but sometimes licked by the mother
256535 the most convincing clue we have comes from sir charles bell bell wrote that he once visited a spot on the tibet bhutan border where he saw a stupa called bang kar bi tse cho ten that contained the bodies of an eight year old boy and girl owho had been slain for the purpose of some religious ritual
256536 a demon scenting the corpses and blood took possession of the cho ten
256537 the slavery in the chumbi valley was of a very mild type
256538 more people were executed in china in the last three months than in the rest of the world for the last three years
256539 told the government that they were only able to do it because their parents had told them how it was done
256540 toil and trouble slavery is on the rise in china as number of poor migrants increases beijing appears unwilling and unable to prevent it
256541 the two races differ strongly in many qualities which have their roots deep down in the characters of the two nations firstly the tibetans are deeply religious the tibetan government is truthful it can be slow obstinate and secretive in dealing with foreigners but it has a strong regard for truth but the chinese authorities from time to time made statements which were deliberately untrue the chinese are far more cruel than the tibetans are when they tried to conquer areas in tibet they used to put to death what prisoners of war they captured although the only offense of these was fighting in defense of their homeland the tibetans when they captured chinese prisoners of war used simply to send them back to china the chinese treat the granting of a favour merely as a step towards asking for another the tibetans do not treat favours in this way they have a national memory of things for which they are grateful many other examples of the differences dividing these two nations could be given for instance the status of women in tibet is higher than china the kinder treatment of animals and the more orderly government
256542 a mans wealth was first and foremost measured through the number of sons he had
256543 it was a matter of survival strong hardy sons were needed in every family to work and to fight bandits and settle feuds
256544 a survey made in 1940 in eastern tibet came to a somewhat different conclusion
256545 there is no method of torture known that is not practiced in here on these tibetans slicing boiling tearing asunder and all to sum up what china is doing here in eastern tibet the main things are collecting taxes robbing oppressing confiscating and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal

256558 weve helped set up this conference to address the need for continued education in the health industry of al anbar
256559 we met with the physicians and i was struck first by their hospitality and heartened to see that they have very good fundamental training
256560 every physician needs continued education i go to lectures on a regular basis for my own learning experience
256561 the conference was assembled to gather physicians from within the province and bring their skills and knowledge together to improve healthcare within the province and all of iraq
256562 this will expose physicians to new trends in medicine and new procedures they can later get additional training on through the ministry of health
256563 first is infant mortality that is a difficult problem to solve because we lack nurses to provide prenatal care the second is not having the medical care to support the population particularly in the western regions
256564 part of the future for the health care of all iraq is an increase in the number of female nurses within the profession
256565 this need is important in obstetrics and gynecology and it is an honorable calling to serve others
256566 i would like to see this continue with even more cooperation with american and european hospitals

256573 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
256574 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
256575 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
256576 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
256577 obama simply asks that big oil companies contribute a reasonable share of the windfall profits they receive from high oil prices over the next five years to pay for emergency assistance for families right now

256601 again thank you mark for a great job at keeping the focus on the issue at hand that is two tier justice and equality issues
256602 good stuff mark truth is the greatest weapon against corruption and the wider the truth is sewn the less the grip of the corruptors
256603 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
256604 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
256605 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
256606 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
256607 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do

256613 now there is a real shortage of organic grain for animal husbandry and dairy operations
256614 we think we can keep the contamination from getting worse by putting safeguards in place so people who want to choose to eat organic products free of genetic contamination can do so
256615 the longer we delay the more challenging it is going to be

256630 i dont support mccain and dont give a damn who wins
256631 only 20 percent of headlines that introduced articles describing palestinian attacks named the group responsible
256632 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
256633 the board really thinks baylor needs a new president who can bring together and unify the various constituencies of the university
256634 we felt like dr lilley came at a very difficult time in the history of baylor and we acknowledge that we do appreciate his service a great deal
256635 with john in place we could take more time to do a thorough search we probably saw john serving out much if not all of his contract but he didnt want to do it under those terms
256636 the reality was we felt unless he was willing to transition he would not have the support of various constituents of the baptist family and move the university in the successful way it is moving
256637 he didnt want to work under those conditions the board felt it could have worked very well but he did not and we respect his reasons
256638 theres no denying we had the tenure situation and the branding situation lilleys initial decision to get rid of the popular
256639 i dont know that there was any one particular relationship that caused the difficulty we did not see the baylor family coming together as we envisioned
256640 two and a half years ago i was invited unanimously by the board of regents to come to baylor
256641 i did not come to baylor to advance my career gerrie his wife and i were reluctant but finally were persuaded to come because of the unanimous vote and the promised prayers of the regents
256642 we felt that we could help to heal the wounded hearts left in the wake of the conflict that preceded us despite the boards unanimous vote it became clear immediately that the baylor board of regents reflected some of the deepest divisions in the baylor family
256643 i am proud of the work my colleagues and i have done to bring the baylor family together and to help the university achieve the ambitious goals set forth in our mission and vision 2012 documented in our annual report just presented to the regents
256644 i deeply regret the action of the board and i do not believe that it reflects the best interests of baylor university
256645 john has left baylor better than he found it john had a passion for the research element of baylor 2012
256646 we are appreciative of his service and love for the university
256647 harold has a track record of proven leadership and is well respected within the baylor family
256648 we will be open minded and do an international search
256649 we want a unifier of the baylor family thats always a good thing
256650 the largest mandate is we need a new president who will listen to all the voices of the baylor family and bring us together under the vision of 2012
256651 actually i think the board of regents is more unified than ive seen it in a long time
256652 we may not agree about every motion but i see the board functioning in a healthy fashion at the end of the day we can walk out of our meetings as a unified functioning board
256653 he is a distinguished alumni and will always have a home with his alumni association
256654 highly sensitive and emotionally charged campus and alumni donor base probably without being fully equipped with an adequate understanding of our experience in baylors recent history
256655 having been away so long im sure it would have been extremely difficult on anyone to get an in depth understanding of the baylor family and its unique structure
256656 while john made himself very accessible to many of the various constituent groups he often remained vigilant to his own opinions
256657 in a delicate time such as this for baylor it is not only important to reach out for input but for that input to have impact on decisions and the direction baylor heads
256658 its become evident how essential inclusiveness and collective buy in are to the success of a private academic institution and alumni relations
256659 the single conduit of information between regents faculty and alumni
256660 probably proved to be too much for any one person and probably not the most effective model moving baylor forward
256661 we understand what a difficult and critical process it is to determine the universitys leadership and to take measures to move baylor forward and our association of alumni and donors stands ready to provide support in any possible way
256662 our regents are entrusted with much and we are all looking toward their leadership and a process that fosters inclusion and input from faculty staff alumni and other constituent groups
256663 that input across the family is always welcomed and appreciated during times such as these
256664 im particularly proud of the university as it is today as a texas baptist im very proud but im also extremely grieved that for the past several years at the board and the highest levels of administration there continues to be disunity
256665 this great flagship ministry of our baptist general convention of texas
256666 i am personally praying that during this time of transition the current leadership both volunteers and paid leaders and the various constituencies will find in their hearts a way to get together and represent what it truly means to be a christian university
256667 they need to genuinely present a christian approach to divisiveness and difficulty we see it in our churches our denomination and in our institutions too often were not representing our lord best when people see us fighting

256669 i want to thank dan for enabling me to see another side of garfield some of the strips he chose were slappers oh i could have left that out it would have been funnier
256670 when i looked at jon and laughed at his crazy antics i thought hes just like me as it turns out i wasnt the only one saw myself in him millions of visitors from all over the world visit garfield minus garfield and tell me they think the same thing now thanks to the awesome generosity and humor of jim davis garfield minus garfield is going to become a book and im absolutely honored to be part of it

256676 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
256677 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
256678 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
256679 i havent scored the runs so far this season in test cricket so of course i felt under pressure
256680 not so much pressure from outside but pressure knowing that i havent contributed and i felt as though i have let the team down that is how i have felt these last few months so today was very special
256681 vaughany said before i went out dont be reckless but be aggressive when i am taking the bowlers on that is when i am at my best
256682 he was pretty with it i wont say he was the earliest adopter but he was an early adopter
256683 while you were sitting there for hours and hours and hours during the session you could surf the internet and look for plane tickets look at espn com and the chicago tribune com
256684 that was a time where a lot of legislators really advanced their internet skills
256685 he always had the cell phone in a clip on the side of his belt
256686 then he had his blackberry clipped to the side so he had two clips
256687 ultimately when he was pushed into the internet age and into the blackberry age he resisted slightly but he realized the benefit and the necessity
256688 and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need
256689 his favorite toy in the whole world is his motorola razr phone and he flips it open and consults experts directly
256690 shes one of the hardest working athletes ive ever worked with
256691 you want your sail to act like a spring to create the power to move your sail forward
256692 you can see the top of the sail really flexing thats really what you want and youre bringing the power from the middle all the way to the top
256693 when i look at pictures i actually realize that im really short and small and im just like god thats not fair i would love to be taller that would be nice im like 5 foot 2
256694 shes one of the hardest working athletes ive ever worked with
256695 she does everything you tell her shes got great character which is the best thing about her in my belief
256696 we do a lot of balance stuff a lot of strength stuff
256697 some base olympic lifting but for her its a lot of upper body stuff especially going over to china theres not a lot of wind for her sport
256698 and so i did portugal when i was 15 poland when i was 16
256699 and then i started seeing all the young girls on the boards and i was like wow you know they are at such a higher level
256700 my sail went in the water my sail got torn i lost 40 seconds off that start off the race
256701 the right to a fair and impartial judge is of particular importance in the present cases
256702 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
256703 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned
256704 the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details

256706 he is one of my top five students that ive ever worked with
256707 they must have loved me how could you not im irresistible
256708 i thought okay hes trying to be the next christian
256709 has received numerous awards and recognition for his apparel design painting stain glass writing and
256710 emphasis added who knew maybe blayne will continue to be full of surprises as the season progresses
256711 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors
256712 i still dont go over the mississippi here in minnesota that i dont look down and remember and pray
256713 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
256714 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
256715 its going to be a celebration of life but i also think its going to be a remembrance of what people went through
256716 i think were going to get an opportunity to feel some of that
256717 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
256718 as a racecar driver i like the corners thats where you make or lose a lot of time but its still a fun race track
256719 pocono is obviously very very unique theres no perfect setup at pocono you have to give up a little in one corner to be good in the others and it takes a while to figure out where to be in that situation you kind of have to play it by ear and see how the car reacts and make adjustments from there
256720 the car was brand new for the first pocono race and its been waiting to go back as fast as it was in june during qualifying and the race i think it should be strong a car that can run in the top 10 if we make the right adjustments i dont see why we cant have a shot at another win as good as it was the first race if we do the right things we should have another shot
256721 you just race as hard as you can every week
256722 we have had some really good cars since sonoma but havent been able to capitalize every weekend
256723 i mean you might not take a chance on fuel or a different pit strategy to win a race but you really dont do much different
256724 one thing about this team i love the most is whether its lowes motor speedway where theres a tire issue you have to do things as a team to try to manipulate the strategy and win a race or here at indy where were having tire problems whatever it may be it seems our team really bites in deep gets a hold of things and is successful
256725 the 77 sam hornish got wide and i dove under him and he came down i have to control my car its not his fault i got sideways and had my car saved felt pretty good about it then the 15 just ran me over
256726 im not sure i ran with jimmie johnson he passed me a couple times so he saw my car a lot
256727 this is where we need to be running and were starting to do it consistently and thats how you gain respect from these guys we just need to keep running up there each week and learning from them this is why im here i want to run with these guys and it feels good
256728 i started thinking now is the right time for them and for me
256729 this is a huge opportunity and it is the right time to push that forward
256730 the linux desktop is something people have wanted for a long time and now its really happening
256731 theres a good chance your cell phone is running linux you dont really care but it is running linux thats a huge volume of users and theyre giving feedback on this end user platform
256732 you have huge volumes of these things shipping and people are getting linux they didnt get it because theyre huge believers in open source they got it because it works well thats a tipping point we can build on
256733 a lot of people have been joking about me being the top dog or big boss so i thought id point out that i work for the board of directors 7 volunteer part time directors who are doing a great job of running the gnome foundation my job is to make them and the gnome foundation even more successful
256734 when i first started working i had a boss who said stormy what can i do for you and ive stuck with that every since a managers role is to help people by working for them or with them to get things done these people are working on gnome because theyre passionate about that and im working for them
256735 trust people to do the right thing trust them to have good ideas to want to make the project organization team or company successful trust them they want to do good empower them make sure they know you trust and believe in them and give them what they need to execute on their great ideas maybe its a computer or a person to bounce ideas off of or help convincing others or some space or fun people to work with or a better understanding of what the company is trying to do
256736 its much more that i have to make my own business cards
256737 ive known for a long time that developers like open source software at hewlett packard i got lots of calls from developers who were excited about what they were doing and wanted to open source what they were doing developers just like open source because it works well they get to interact they get recognition at and said they consciously chose open source because it helps them retain developers i think youre starting to see more companies doing that ive talked to a lot of companies that are nobody i can quote for you though
256738 the default desktop for many linux distributions is gnome and a lot of people are using linux on the desktop i recently read a survey that said 46 of all enterprise users use openoffice org thats a good sign that the linux desktop is being used by a huge percentage of enterprise users
256739 at everyone wanted to say hi and show me what theyre working on i met with several hundred people its so much fun to be involved in the community and showing the world im part of the community im excited to be working with sponsors and get enterprises using gnome and helping to build those relationships i get energy from interacting with other people i enjoy talking to people and seeing their excitement
256740 i started out going to jmu and kind of made a poor decision on deciding not to play there
256741 after youre away from the game you realize how much you miss it its kind of one of those deals where i was just itching to get back out there
256742 ive been out of it for so long i want to get in there and work hard and prove myself
256743 i wasnt ready to be thrown into a system like that and actually the coach that recruited me to jmu and the position coach when i was being recruited both left before the season started so i just kind of got thrown into the mix without anyone really there to connect with as far as how they brought me in and everything
256744 i called my dad and told him you know i dont think things are working out
256745 and i dont know if this is what i want to do maybe i should concentrate on school and just get my degree he told me to stick it out for a little bit that its just one of those things where freshmen have a tough time coming in and once you get through camp itll be alright but i dont know it just didnt feel right
256746 coach durden he just talked me through it and asked me if it was really what i wanted to do
256747 coach newsome heard that i wanted to go and start playing again
256748 and he asked me what i wanted to do so he talked to coach west and kind of put in a good word for me
256749 hes the type of guy thats a plus for any program he takes care of his business goes to class does the right things so that was the first thing that attracted me to him and obviously he can run i went and watched him run a lot of track meets and hes the type of player that can really run
256750 extremely overdue except im not so sure about calling up a 30 year old career minor leaguer who has yet to see a single pitch in the majors
256751 i putted well today but the longest putt ive holed all week has been about 12ft my irons have been really good and my driving has been consistent

256912 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities

256965 in this case we were struck by the fact that pugh has a history of abusing animals and we think its particularly important that animals be shielded from that
256966 law enforcement gets discretion and its entirely their decision but given the history i hope the judge will decide the dog should be confiscated
256967 if shes found guilty i strongly urge the judge to not allow her to own any more animals
256968 seventy percent of animal abusers commit other crimes from murder to trafficking in drugs and firearms offenses in 1986 only four states had felony animal abuse laws today there are only five that dont arkansas mississippi idaho north dakota and south dakota we hope to have that remedied in the 2009 legislative session

256976 tulsa has been an important part of our efforts to be successful in oklahoma city with the nba relocation
256977 ultimately the team must be a state wide team and weve committed to that and believe in that we know it will work but the first place we need to be is in tulsa

256982 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
256983 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
256984 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
256985 any hope that plaintiffs could renew their season tickets left with them
256986 neither the city of seattle nor the nba are parties here but plaintiffs claim a right to have this court drag the team and the nba back for two more years of games plaintiffs dont intend to buy tickets for or attend at a venue the team no longer has a right to use
256987 this is absurd no such contract right exists and plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief must be dismissed
256988 barack obama told a group of florida donors friday night that republicans will try to make voters afraid of him and suggested they would use his race to scare up votes for john mccain
256989 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
256990 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife
256991 we know the strategy because theyve already shown their cards ultimately i think the american people recognize that old stuff hasnt moved us forward that old stuff just divides us
256992 an increase in racist and white supremacist activity mainly on the internet
256993 i havent seen this much anger in a long long time
256994 nothing has awakened normally complacent white americans more than the prospect of america having an overtly nonwhite president
256995 roper says white revolution receives about 10 new applicants each week more than double the norm
256996 white supremacy groups have increased by nearly half since 2000 according to the southern poverty law center
256997 the truth is were finding an explosion in these kinds of hateful sentiments on the net and its a growing problem
256998 there are probably thousands of web sites that do this now i couldnt even tell you how many are out there because its growing so fast
256999 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative
257000 we will get out of this trough and we will go back to moderate and normal interest rates hopefully in about six months to a year
257001 this year is difficult because of rising crude oil prices and commodity prices
257002 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
257003 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catch up and ive not been able to do that
257004 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
257005 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
257006 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
257007 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
257008 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
257009 and he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one
257010 he can do no wrong can you see the light
257011 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
257012 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
257013 but the plan satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
257014 i believe the agreement is good for india good for the world good for nonproliferation i believe we answered every question satisfactorily
257015 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
257016 an arrow was launched through the heart of the npt today with the approval of the india safeguards agreement
257017 as a result of heavy handed diplomacy india can benefit from nuclear help from abroad while keeping its weapons programme unchecked hypocrisy wins
257018 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor
257019 all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
257020 not leaving until we call this congress back into session and vote for energy independence
257021 vision of the future by the democrat party the lights are out theres no power and the air conditioning is gonna go off soon
257022 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world
257023 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
257024 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
257025 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities
257026 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
257027 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
257028 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
257029 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
257030 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
257031 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
257032 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
257033 even the worst polluters on the road today are far cleaner than most vehicles were a few decades ago
257034 in europe vehicle specifications now regularly list a models co2 emissions
257035 everybody in europe knows what their vehicles co2 emissions are
257036 lo que estamos sugiriendo al ministro es que se haga un bloque latinoamericano entre gobiernos como el que se tuvo cuando se hizo un arbitraje hace unos a os formar una posici n firme y demandar ante europa la deuda moral que tiene del no cumplimiento del acuerdo
257037 la vemos como una salida inexplicable no puede ser en la l gica com n que gente de tanto nivel como los ministros y negociadores comerciales estuvieran equivocados es claro que hay un incumplimiento
257038 no es que signifique una gran rebaja son apenas 28 euros 43 4 d lares y el resto se reduce en los pr ximos ocho a os
257039 lo que est n dando es muy poco son migajas
257040 never let them rest until your good is better and your better best
257041 i think the internet will be the main media base
257042 print journalism will be around but will not be as important as online media because the younger generation is brought up as already tech savvy
257043 writers now not only must focus on their written work but must also find video photos and audio to accompany their story
257044 i had to send out audition tapes to many television stations when i was starting out
257045 but you have something that we did not have the internet now you can just broadcast yourself by the way of the web
257046 the greatest outlet for photography in the future is going to be the web
257047 in contemporary times you dont see tap dancing that much anymore so its important for me to get a hint out there to make the public more aware
257048 i think its not only important for the field but for american culture as well
257049 he complains about his knees and grumbles that hes shuffling and all that but then hell turn around and joke at my age of 47 what more can you expect he never lets on a hint that hes so much older
257050 its hard to keep a song in my head with all the noise and then try to also interact with the crowd and say hello to people
257051 i love getting little kids to come dance with me to make some motion and get them embodying the dance as well thats wonderful
257052 mr washington cannot play next to those statue musicians on maxwell street or else he will be arrested
257053 on that street there can not be any vendors or musicians because of its historical importance i feel its all about class segregation because the mayor has replaced the poor people with the rich
257054 to raise the fee of the market 5000 so that poor vendors can not pay for it
257055 city hall favors the rich and is the stalin of chicago
257056 we are proud that we have a lot of customers that cheer for us and say theyll see us next sunday
257057 because some buyers were investing in a quick rich system people purchased houses they could not afford and the real estate market bubble bursted
257058 if i do well my family does well and when i do bad my family will suffer
257059 now i have to work three jobs to maintain my same lifestyle
257060 some of my other colleagues even went out of business completely
257061 i ask them to pay me for their food but they always try to give it to one of the other older workers it can be frustrating
257062 i made my first dollar when i was five and opened a bank account that same year
257063 often i pay for the phone and cable bills and other stuff like my shoes
257064 last time i checked i had about 3 000 dollars in my bank account
257065 a hundred years from now youll be dead you know it i know it
257066 i want you to be the lighting not the thunder
257067 unfortunately there have been a lot of cutbacks in the business because of money and a lack of advertisements
257068 now theres not as much money and not as much interest
257069 normally we would send a whole crew editing on scene the art department the editor of the magazine like we did in salt lake city and greece
257070 im sure well have good material to publish and there will be good visibility for it
257071 it may not be as big as it was in atlanta or salt lake city but well still have a very strong presence
257072 luxury of having a fall back position in case we miss something
257073 itll be my job to winnow down the big pile to the small pile
257074 i have to cut that edit to something thats presentable to the editor because the editor will not want to see 40 000 pictures hell want to see the 20 best
257075 geared towards what the editor of the magazine thinks is appropriate for the market and also how much money the advertising people can support
257076 the best thing is to have a source on the record so that the reader can judge the integrity of the source
257077 in many cases sources able to provide information on celebrities depend on them for their livelihood
257078 that would explain why so many are willing to talk about a subject but not want to be identified by name
257079 the essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held but in how they are held instead of being held dogmatically they are held tentatively and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment

257083 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
257084 the bush administration is unprecedented in how systematic the politicization is and how it extends both across the wider organization chart and deep down within the bureaucracy
257085 theyve been very consistent from day 1 in learning the lessons of previous administrations and pushing those tactics to the limit
257086 we pledge 7 slots within 40 days and 40 nights let the games begin

257111 once they are here the opportunity is easy to understand
257112 they invest in vacation property or a second home then they start spending more personal time here they begin to realize they can work from here bring their skills here and become part of the growth that is happening soon they start spending a majority of their time in costa rica and then look to moving here full time they love it and so do we
257113 i estimate we are in the first 20 percent of the cycle of growth here
257114 if you take other coastal resort areas like hawaii or cancun as a model you find development expands after major hotels are in operation in this region more than a dozen hotel projects have been announced with key flagships like the four seasons in place already with more visitors more people fall in love with the area and want to come here and live
257115 our team consists of the people who developed the four seasons the top service providers in latin america definitely in costa rica its a great costa rican team not a foreign team they know how to work here they have the contacts and the track record theyve already done it
257116 we wanted to build a resort community that would allow our investors to live here year round and totally enjoy the day to day lifestyle at the same time if an owner plans only to vacation here and wants to rent his property out for the rest of the year we wanted to make that easy for them too our goal was to create a community and the amenity set that would inspire anyone who visits this area to want to stay at coco bay estates because of all that it offers
257117 there arent too many places in the world where you can go to the beach go to the rainforest go surfing visit a volcano go atving hiking or play in waterfalls all in the same day and then go home to a community that is comfortable safe and in what we call affordable luxury
257118 we love it our families love it our friends love it and were pretty sure lots of other folks are going to love it as well

257121 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
257122 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
257123 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
257124 the executive presents a litany of contrary arguments all of which are unavailing
257125 t he executive takes the committee to task for failing to utilize its inherent contempt authority but there are serious problems presented by the prospect of inherent contempt not the least of which is that the executive is attempting to have it both ways on this point
257126 at the very least however the executive cannot simultaneously question the sufficiency and availability of an alternative remedy but nevertheless insist that the committee must attempt to
257127 significantly immunity is strictly a legal issue and it is the judiciary that must
257128 rather than running roughshod over separation of powers principles the court believes that entertaining this case will reinforce them two parties cannot negotiate in good faith when one side asserts legal privileges but insists that they cannot be tested in court in the traditional manner that is true whether the negotiating partners are private firms or the political branches of the federal government
257129 the notion that the framers contemplated that congress would be required to shut down the operations of government before an article iii court could exercise its traditional role of resolving legal disputes is an odd one
257130 the court does not understand why separation of powers principles are more offended when the article i branch sues the article ii branch than when the article ii branch sues the article i branch
257131 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides
257132 similarly if the executives absolute immunity argument were to prevail congress could be left with no recourse to obtain information that is plainly not subject to any colorable claim of executive privilege for instance surely at least some of the questions that the committee intends to ask ms miers would not elicit a response subject to an assertion of privilege so too for responsive documents many of which may even have been produced already the executives proposed absolute immunity would thus deprive congress of even non privileged information that is an unacceptable result
257133 the mere fact that this case involves a dispute between the political branches or that such disputes are normally settled through negotiation and accommodation is not sufficient to render the committees right non judicially remedial that argument is foreclosed by precedent dating back to united states v nixon including case law involving subpoena disputes between the two political branches the court therefore rejects the executives argument that the dja does not permit the committee to have its day in court
257134 article i the committee asserts provides congress with an implied right to investigate in furtherance of its legislative function that right has been recognized by the supreme court which has also held that it carries with it a necessary corollary that congress may rely upon compulsory process to enforce its investigative authority
257135 were trying to develop a vocabulary of what san jose will become
257136 to be able to get away from our present day car centric culture we need to be able to easily walk to the library the schools the transit nodes the local parks and trails and the local shopping districts
257137 we can say plan for people not cars but without the infrastructure well have people living basically in ghettos with no place to put their cars
257138 this indicates to me that there are a lot of problems in house
257139 an alliance with microsoft would have been a good thing for both companies and im sorry to see it didnt happen

257142 you dont have to go to a gym and put my kids in a daycare and ive made so many new friends out here
257143 it was designed with children in mind said christine royer the franchise owner of stroller strides so with that in mind we keep the babies moving and anytime we do stop we entertain them and interact with them by singing songs to them and getting them involved with us
257144 the dads have a little hard time keeping up after moms have been working out all week so its kind of fun but we really enjoy it
257145 therapy is for me getting out in the morning and seeing the other moms and getting the social aspect of getting out of the house for the day is just huge gates said
257146 in the near term we want to launch these with great customization and a great library of accessories this fall i think there is a lot more we can do with them you will see us continue to add experiences that make use of the avatar
257147 our goal is not to create a sterile environment where you move furniture around its about how can we make our gaming experiences better
257148 returning to islay after three nights of solitude was weird all those roads restaurants and people
257149 tv shows which tend to be successful are to do with contemporary life and this is so far removed from life as we know it
257150 physically im nothing like the pictures of henry and therein lies the boldness we needed to do something to get a contemporary audience watching to draw in people in their 20s and 30s
257151 and elizabeth taylor had eight husbands and thats 20th century hollywood not just 16th century england sometimes i think people are just prudish
257152 he was the spare he was prince harry now if you like
257153 his elder brother arthur our william he was supposed to be king but he died henry was 14 nowadays wed never expect someone of that age to deal with that
257154 it might not appeal to an older more critical audience we have to condense everything by about ten years
257155 for example the whole anne boleyn thing happened when henry was into his 30s we set it in his 20s otherwise wed end up with about 50 hours of television that nobody would want to watch
257156 with henry i dont look at any pictures of him
257157 i have to draw on his personality and i had to research deeply into the flaws of the man
257158 i dont play him as a good man i think he was a smart man and a charismatic one but his bad deeds outweigh his good ones
257159 he gave his country a lot of pain with the reformation people had to choose between their head and their hearts his way or the popes way and god help them if they chose the popes way
257160 the simple fact is that henry wanted a younger more beautiful wife who could bear him sons and this is a man who was used to getting everything he wanted
257161 very few people in the world apart from a few dictators know what that feels like these days certainly no one in britain has held that kind of power for centuries
257162 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wow s first sex scene it was with a porn star i dont know her name shes probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad
257163 i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
257164 diabetes is the no 1 cause of amputation but those patients have other problems that make it more complicated
257165 a soldier who is a healthy candidate would greatly benefit from this someone who has been injured that could be a combat injury or an injury from a trauma who still wants to live an active life
257166 the white part is the part i will remove then i will put on this
257167 it has both a bone ingrowth part and a soft tissue ingrowth part
257168 if the patient is comfortable and there is no infection and everything goes well the idea is to make the technology available to human patients in addition to being an option for other kinds of patients
257169 if we can help patients at the same time as we are advancing knowledge then we prefer that
257170 he has three legs we let him do whatever he wants
257171 the fact that the va is unable to identify how billions of dollars are being spent underscores the urgent need to review and refine a process that is clearly broken
257172 stewardship of taxpayer dollars needs to be more than just a miscellaneous obligation this gravely concerns me as well as several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and i believe it is important to get to the root of this problem
257173 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
257174 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
257175 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
257176 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
257177 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
257178 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video
257179 a lot of people are too scared to put up a fight theyre afraid theyll get fired theyve seen their co workers get fired
257180 theyre bombarding us with so much work and so many violations its difficult to keep track
257181 the problem is that a lot of employees dont know what their rights are
257182 a lot of people are too scared to put up a fight theyre afraid theyll get fired theyve seen their co workers get fired
257183 if i could fill all the positions i have it would be 190
257184 i need to be put out of my misery does anyone have a gun
257185 he was escorted off the ward by police officers in front of his co workers
257186 taking care of patients bathing shaving taking them out for walks making sure they had good care it was natural for me to take care of the patients
257187 they werent taking care of patients and i let them know about it
257188 what is happening is that when theyre charging people they come in with multiple charges which makes it very difficult to exonerate an employee
257189 do you know how hard it is to fire a federal employee
257190 to remove someone from federal government employment is extremely difficult i cant just decide i can fire some guy because hes late there are too many checks and balances
257191 weve only fired four people in a workforce of over 900 employees show me a private firm with that kind of record
257192 it scares me to death that im losing my civil service retirement employees
257193 we sometimes disagree on how to get there one of my goals is to hear concerns up front rather than having to deal with them later
257194 when i took this job two years ago i walked into a negative situation and its steadily getting worse
257195 the union has tried to take the high road we dont want to cause trouble we want to work with management but management has to be responsible
257196 one thing that has transformed the va is performance measures
257197 it was a heck of a lot better in 1981
257198 taking care of patients was number one the patient care has gone downhill
257199 arbitration cases cost us between 2 000 3 000 and it comes out of our treasury
257200 its to managements advantage to drain our coffers but were a strong union and were willing to invest in our employees
257201 its disappointing that the union has taken its concerns to a public forum
257202 i think where the partnership arrangement has faltered is on the side of labor and its desire for co management you cant have co management the management is responsible for patient care the union is not
257203 ill probably work until fall and then ill probably hang it up

257215 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
257216 frankly as rollouts go i so would have like to see this go way differently and way better
257217 human health in a changing climate a canadian assessment of vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity
257218 if this government doesnt have a clear adaptation strategy and is treating these assessments the way that they are

257223 tobacco producers and their families will be able to bring closure to what has been a very stressful time
257224 this program is available to help producers exit the industry transition to other crops or find new opportunities outside agriculture
257225 the unique challenges tobacco farmers are facing have never come with easy solutions
257226 as you know farming is a business but its also a proud way of life that goes back generations these funds will help those who wish to continue to produce to do so under a new provincial licensing system
257227 to help communities transition to a non tobacco based economy
257228 it seems like a knee jerk reaction by the public
257229 im not suggesting in any way that the charges arent serious but it would appear to be a bit overblown
257230 a basic tenet of the justice system is that youre presumed innocent and part of that is judicial interim release

257235 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
257236 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
257237 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
257238 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
257239 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
257240 it burst into flames and it appears that the two parties that were on board are deceased
257241 we dont have any information as to what the aircraft was of the serial number or if it was training or doing something else
257242 arms were flailing and stuff like that but then i saw the guy had a knife a big frickin rambo knife a hunting knife and it was covered in blood
257243 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
257244 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out
257245 he came very calmly towards us with the knife in one hand the head in the other
257246 the three of us were just standing there in shock and he just calmly looked at us with sunglasses on and dropped the head in front of us like it was no big deal
257247 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
257248 he picked the head up looked at the cops dropped the head and walked back to the body
257249 when attempts were made to have him exit and surrender to police were unsuccessful additional resources including the rcmp emergency response team and negotiator team were called in to assist

257271 ive said it over and over and ill say it again the concept of formatting dates should never be something that your database code should ever worry about
257272 by adding indexes on the foreign keys on three tables
257273 we saw a reduction of 87 in total i o load it really struck me that having sql server do this by default would avoid a lot of apparent performance problems should sql server simply do this by default when you declare a foreign key reference
257274 the response that came back was authoritative and well reasoned yet it also smacks of its not an error because we say it isnt hopefully this response and kind of response will be reconsidered in the future
257275 if you pretend that something is a bug you are stating that a developer wrongly coded a program because it does not meet the requirements and the specifications if the design is wrong and the program is written by design then the program is wrong but you cannot say it has a bug

257277 in critical production systems before making changes to the environment lots of testing is required to know the effect of those changes and this usually takes lots of time to test for the stability and effects of the change in oracle 11g this thing is simplified and a new feature database replay is added which can be used to simulate the production workload on a test system
257278 once upon a time a small village of developers decided to create a database one day everything changed a giant from a faraway technology land of perpetual sun approached the villagers one very brave villager decided to take the database back to what they had originally intended he stripped away all of the fancy features they had just added to be able to compete with the giants as soon as he completed his task clouds began to form and a light drizzle started to fall

257314 we see women become anorexic while trying to lose pregnancy weight
257315 it can even start during the pregnancy this struggle with weight issues the women become obsessed with body image theyve been on a series of diets and weight loss programs but at some point the wish to lose weight becomes overwhelming an obsession
257316 we tend to not do things in moderation thats where these women get into difficulty there is no middle ground they want to be perfect they dont want to be average

257358 opinions expressed herein are solely those of the authors for official log cabin california information please
257359 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
257360 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
257361 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
257362 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
257363 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
257364 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
257365 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
257366 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
257367 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
257368 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
257369 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
257370 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
257371 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
257372 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
257373 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

257376 se em vez de sufocar sentimentos como a raiva o medo e a humilha o passamos a aceit los e a express los com maturidade na hora em que eles aparecem agimos no sentido de evitar novas tens es e dores musculares e at mesmo de aliviar as antigas que est o congeladas e podem incomodar por anos a fio

257378 there was lots of pressure said collingwood who was in danger of being dropped after a summer of poor performances
257379 its not pressure so much from the outside as knowing that you have to contribute or you are letting the team down
257380 today was very special everything went my way and its a day i wont forget its been tough over the past couple of months
257381 he said to me just before i went out to bat dont be reckless but be aggressive i quite enjoyed having my freedom from the skipper thats the way i play my best cricket
257382 it simply wasnt good enough weve got that out of the way in the dressing room weve got a gift tomorrow morning and thats the second new ball
257383 were going to have really make it work fast for us arthur said
257384 the games on a knife edge we had an opportunity today which we didnt take we forgot about everything weve spoken about today
257385 but weve got that second opportunity with the new ball the wickets flat there wasnt a huge amount of spin on offer and it didnt swing much today when the sun was out
257386 we believe we can chase down most totals on that but its going to be difficult
257387 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
257388 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
257389 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
257390 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
257391 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
257392 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
257393 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
257394 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
257395 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
257396 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
257397 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
257398 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
257399 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
257400 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
257401 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
257402 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
257403 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
257404 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
257405 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
257406 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
257407 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts

257409 shes been pushing for a live together situation for the past year
257410 zac finally gave in to the idea hes calling it their shack up experiment
257411 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
257412 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
257413 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
257414 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

257417 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

257419 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
257420 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
257421 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
257422 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
257423 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
257424 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
257425 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
257426 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
257427 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
257428 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
257429 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
257430 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
257431 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
257432 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
257433 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
257434 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
257435 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
257436 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
257437 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
257438 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
257439 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
257440 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
257441 theres likely to be a fair amount of time between now and when that event actually takes place and thats a time period in which we intend to generate a very significant amount of capital

257459 yo creo que a n no me he hecho a la idea de serlo lo veo escrito en los resultados en prensa y me parece una marca m s creo que a n lo pienso s lo como marca personal m a me cuesta creer con la gente que he visto correr en espa a que no hubieran corrido tanto o m s porque hab a y hay gente de mucha calidad
257460 yo creo que s la he analizado y salvo una fase entre los 40 y 60 metros cuando alcanzo la verticalidad todo lo dem s va perfecto igual en esa fase no di todo lo que ten a o no iba colocado como desear a pero a veces sin ser perfecto t cnicamente se consiguen los resultados
257461 espero que s porque seguir entrenando para rebajarla no me gusta pensar que a partir de ahora se trata solo de acercarme a esa marca prefiero pensar que por poco que sea la puedo limar alguna cent sima
257462 es temporal si miras el ranking mundial del a o pasado por ejemplo hay un buen grupo de atletas blancos rondando los 10 10 o por debajo caso de osovnikar hace dos a os yepishin alg n atleta alem n pero por ahora mira me siento orgulloso sobre todo por dunia mi entrenadora
257463 en primer lugar estar risas s que suena a poco pero son mis primeros juegos ol mpicos
257464 yo empec de alev n en la escuela de atletismo de m stoles y desde entonces mi entrenadora es dunia mart n pues imagina cross fondo saltos lanzamientos hice de todo hasta cumplir los 18 a os en los que ya me especialic y los recuerdos son gratos era un ni o y esto era un juego hoy a veces cuando me preguntan que en que trabajo les digo que juego a las carreras
257465 no lo definir a exactamente as yo ven a de quedar 4 en el mundial j nior del a o anterior en el 4x100 y con resultados as ya te entran muchas ganas de seguir entrenando de aquella final de riga todav a encuentro rivales en las pistas lewis francis alexandro cavallaro marcin jedrusinski
257466 bueno esa es la espinita que tengo clavada en teor a deber a ser mejor atleta de 200 que de 100 por entrenamientos que hago pero creo que me ha faltado aprender a correrlos mejor este a o parece que ya me va saliendo mejor en cuanto al record lo veo dif cil en la superliga tuve un tiempo de reacci n de 0 285 que si lo llevas a un tiempo decente ser a estar cerca del r cord pero es algo que no me da dolor de cabeza s lo quiero volverlo a correr en los juegos y acabar con una sensaci n como en annecy que vi el resultado y se me puso una sonrisa de oreja a oreja
257467 tyson gay es competici n se crece en grandes campeonatos asafa es t cnica corre perfecto y usain es f sico alto ahora mas fuerte dif cil elegir un favorito aunque despu s de lo que demostr en osaka y si se recupera de la lesi n para el 100 el favorito es gay
257468 es el mote del barrio de un ni o de 7 a os era delgado bajito y estaba todo el d a corriendo y saltando y as hasta que llegu al mundo del atletismo
257469 este a o lo veo regular hay gente buena para correr entre mis compa eros hay atletas que hace 4 a os compet amos y un d a ganaba uno y otro ganaba otro no se si por falta de motivaci n o lesiones no han conseguido progresar en sus marcas tambi n est el tema de las lesiones que ha parado la progresi n de varios de ellos como orkatz josu cecilio ivan todos ellos de mi generaci n a mi me encantar a estar peg ndome con ellos en el campeonato de espa a por ver quienes son los 3 atletas que competir an en los juegos entre otras cosas por tener un relevo de final en cuanto a lo que viene por detr s ya va saliendo gente como luis wee jos l pez marc altes lvaro aljarilla javi sanz todos ellos yo creo que son capaces de bajar alg n d a de 10 30 o de 20 80 y espero que entrenen duro porque los resultados llegan trabajando

257487 providing a steady supply of wood will help expand local markets thereby reducing the cost of fuels reduction projects on the front range
257488 we didnt envision this effort as a mountain pine beetle program but we believe the sites will become increasingly more important as the epidemic reaches into the front range
257489 only sites where provisions have been made to immediately treat pine beetle infested wood such as the gilpin county and meeker park sites will accept hot wood prior to sept 1
257490 we believe the program will make it possible for entrepreneurs to enter the wood market with new ideas for using the wood because they will not have to invest as much time and capital to get started
257491 through this program secondary processors could see significant savings in sorting transportation and warehousing throughout most of the year

257500 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
257501 this bill sends a clear message to americas servicemen and women their families and our veterans that we all appreciate and respect their service and sacrifice
257502 while many of these changes are long overdue i am proud congress has renewed its commitment to increasing education benefits for veterans and instituting critical reforms to our military health care system it also boosts military construction so that our troops have better housing health care and day care facilities and more effective training facilities
257503 as working families across the country continue to battle the effects of a slowing economy and record high energy prices it is absurd for congress to turn their backs on the american people and shut down the institution for a month long vacation
257504 with the driving public groaning under high gas prices it is embarrassing that the house leadership wouldnt even schedule a vote on expanded drilling and increasing refining capacity
257505 american workers and manufacturers are fighting for their livelihoods in the face of chinese mercantilism while congress takes a month long siesta
257506 we clearly have unfinished business and if we are serious about getting the american economy back on a growth path we have got to tackle the most prominent economic challenges of today volatile energy costs and chinese trade abuses
257507 closing the doors to the federal government and allowing members of congress to skip town for a five week recess sends exactly the wrong message to the public at exactly the wrong time americans deserve better
257508 we have an obligation to serve those who have served our nation
257509 i am pleased that congress has prioritized the passage of veterans funding for 2009
257510 all brave men and women of the united states military particularly those injured while serving our country deserve the best possible medical care
257511 we continue to hear about the difficulties that some student loan originators are having in attracting the initial capital needed to make student loans in the upcoming academic year we have apprehensions that this ongoing situation could eventually jeopardize the ability of students and parents to obtain federally backed college student loans at the lender of their choice
257512 while these lenders are working diligently to ensure that no student in their service areas goes without access to a federal student loan this summer and fall they can provide no long term assurances that federal student loans will remain available in future years
257513 to truly provide a long term solution we believe that the federal government must address the underlying issue that there is no viable capital market available to finance student loans
257514 without support from the capital markets the long term health of the student loan program is in jeopardy
257515 a specific description of any documents withheld from production on the basis of executive privilege consistent with the terms of the memorandum opinion
257516 every day we delay finding a solution to rising energy costs is another day arkansans are forced to spend more of their money at the pump
257517 congress cant bring relief to americans energy needs if a comprehensive bill isnt brought to the house floor for a vote
257518 we cant wait until september to increase our domestic energy supply
257519 its in the best interest of the people of the third district for my colleagues to allow a vote on a commonsense energy plan that will allow us to utilize all sources of energy which includes domestic exploration renewable energy and the development of alternative energy sources
257520 we have to go forward and one of the things that we are proudest of is the letters that we get from these students
257521 we really can help to fulfil their dreams and its so wonderful that we didnt want to say we cannot do it this year so we are doing the best we can
257522 today we do what is morally right and economically just today we give americas working women a real dose of liberty
257523 in passing this act i do so in memory of our mother and millions and millions of american women who ask only to be treated fairly in the workplace and earn equal pay for equal work and get that check
257524 though i have long been a supporter of higher education and programs making education more readily available the senate passed conference report imposes obligations on oklahoma colleges and universities and even tries to direct the decisions of our state legislatures
257525 i take seriously the concerns laid out by the national governors association who state that the maintenance of effort provision in the bill
257526 the switch to dtv could leave our most vulnerable citizens without access to critical news weather and public safety information with less than seven months until the transition the federal government has not done nearly enough to facilitate this process for seniors low income families and other vulnerable communities i urge the president to quickly develop a comprehensive plan and commit the resources necessary to help make the transition as smooth as possible
257527 the bush epas denial of californias request for a waiver was not supported by the science or the law and it must be overturned i will continue to use every tool i have to reverse the bush administrations outrageous decision so that california and the other states can continue the fight against global warming
257528 as gas prices continue to rise we need to ensure that americans have access to public transit as an alternative mass transit can save households thousands of dollars a year but increased ridership takes a toll on our public transportation infrastructure my legislation will help mass transit agencies meet their growing demands without sacrificing service
257529 new york has the nations largest public transportation system and this legislation will help it remain the nations best as well
257530 women have shattered so many barriers in the 45 years since the equal pay act was enacted and for young women paving their way in the workforce today the sky is the limit but we still have work to do to truly level the playing field
257531 thats why i have championed the paycheck fairness act to build on the promise of the equal pay act and help close the pay gap the act would prevent regulate and reduce pay discrimination for women across the country i am proud that the house has passed this legislation to help ensure equality in the american workplace i hope that we can take quick action on this measure in the senate and that the president will then do the right thing for these hard working individuals and their families and sign this long overdue bill into law
257532 today we build on the legacy of those who preceded us those pioneers at seneca falls as well as the women who blazed a path in the house today we stand up for working women and their families
257533 as members of congress my colleagues and i are fortunate to come to work everyday in this extraordinary institution from different regions with different backgrounds and different experiences but man and woman we are paid equally every woman in this country deserves the same every family deserves to know that this institution will act today to make it real it is about ensuring that women who work hard and productively and carry a full range of family responsibilities are paid at a rate they are entitled
257534 today the congress has sent a message to women across the country that their work is valued equal pay is an issue of fundamental fairness but as families grapple with difficult economic times equal pay for equal work is often about daily survival for millions of families i commend congresswoman rosa delauro for her tenacious leadership and my colleagues in congress for their strong support of this essential legislation
257535 forty five years after passage of the equal pay act it is shocking and totally unacceptable that women continue to be paid substantially less than men doing the same jobs
257536 the paycheck fairness act is essential because current law is not up to the job of eliminating the discrimination that causes this wage gap
257537 aauw is proud to be a critical force behind passage of the paycheck fairness act and action on the bill comes at an important time in this economy women are even more sensitive to issues of equal pay
257538 younger women especially also identify equal pay for equal work as a vote driver and i suspect itll be on the minds of a lot of women as they go to the polls in november
257539 know what to ask amp know your rights a pay equity guide on how to help yourself in the workplace
257540 the claw back statute represents a harmful trade precedence and the u s needs to respond forcefully and appropriately if the japanese government insists on following its current course of action
257541 my bill will provide new tools to stop any effort to use the claw back statute against goss in a case where the japanese government has tried to unfairly and inappropriately protect a japanese company found guilty of fraudulent practices while u s markets remain open and free u s companies need to know that our trade laws will be enforced against unscrupulous players whether domestic or foreign i am confident that when our senate colleagues fully learn of the fight faced by goss this bill will move very quickly
257542 it is critical for goss international its workers in new hampshire and for anyone who believes in fair trade that foreign companies which have broken our trade laws be brought to justice tks has been found guilty in our courts and ordered to pay over 30 million in damages and the japanese government should not be allowed to nullify this judgment through retaliatory acts that are solely intended to subvert our rule of law this legislation will help ensure that our laws are enforced in spite of the japanese governments unfortunate actions and will go a long way to ensure fair play among our global trading partners i look forward to working with senator sununu and other members of congress to help move this bill and protect not only our trade laws but also the hundreds of manufacturing jobs at goss
257543 this common sense and cost effective solution is an important way that we can begin to tackle the challenges our nations health care system faces
257544 community health centers have succeeded in bringing primary care to millions of americans and we should build on this progress
257545 would expand the highly successful and cost effective federally qualified health center model to every corner of this country the result would make certain that every man woman and child in this country has access to comprehensive primary care services
257546 it is disappointing to me that in very hot weather states like arizona and other southern states republicans who should be demanding immediate federal assistance to protect the elderly and the sick are holding this effort hostage to their political agenda
257547 a timely recognition of a worthy effort when affordable housing is such a critical issue in vermont
257548 we think what is taking place is a rate increase
257549 ensuring americans in illinois and across the country have access to affordable healthcare should be a top priority
257550 over the years community health centers have proven their ability and capacity to expand access to healthcare lower costs and improve quality of care these centers patients often experience better outcomes and health disparities are commonly reduced i am proud to join senator sanders in introducing the access for all america act this common sense and cost effective solution is an important way that we can begin to tackle the challenges our nations health care system faces
257551 we must reform the healthcare system so that every american has quality affordable healthcare but an insurance card is not enough access to primary care is an essential part of ensuring that all americans receive the care they need and this legislation is an important part of improving this access community health centers have succeeded in bringing primary care to millions of americans and we should build on this progress
257552 this country faces a major health care crisis among many other serious problems 56 million americans lack adequate access to basic medical care dental care and low cost prescription drugs the access for all america act would expand the highly successful and cost effective federally qualified health center model to every corner of this country the result would make certain that every man woman and child in this country has access to comprehensive primary care services
257553 by guaranteeing health care to all americans we can save lives prevent human suffering and save taxpayers billions of dollars
257554 its not often that we are presented with a program that meets critical needs while reducing overall health care expenditures by more than it costs at a time when families are being squeezed harder than ever by huge gas prices higher food costs and a dismal economy we owe the american people this common sense reform

257579 much of the decline to the housing first strategy that has been promoted by the bush administration and congress and increasingly adopted across the country
257580 if you listen to the patient the patient will give you the diagnosis
257581 thats what addiction means we anticipate that people will relapse its part of the recovery process and the advantage of this harm reduction approach is that people are not evicted and homeless again simply because theyve relapsed they remain housed and so can continue to work on curing their addiction or improving their mental health what we do that is is to separate housing from treatment thus if you relapse youre still housed theres treatment for addiction and for mental illness and theres housing for homelessness
257582 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative
257583 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
257584 much of the decline to the housing first strategy that has been promoted by the bush administration and congress and increasingly adopted across the country

257593 you know i knew something would happen i had a feeling last night when i went to bed i am very disappointed

257599 it is the responsibility of the people to vote the congress out of office for good we need action not talk
257600 we are giving our wealth to the middle east because we refuse to provide our own energy why because our congress represents the corporate state and not the people
257601 in fact every new promise that the new members of congress ran on to get elected remains exactly that an empty promise i have to laugh when i recall the self righteous finger waving of house speaker nancy pelosi and company now go on and enjoy your vacation you earned it
257602 we have all been wringing our hands about energy and our dependence on foreign oil for the past 30 years
257603 and we wonder why the public is cynical and the wrong track numbers are at an all time high
257604 members of congress and in this example i mean the majority have refused to take any action because it is easier to wait out the presidential election and then see what the climate is like because unfortunately for the people congress can choose to vote only when it is convenient to do so
257605 because there is nothing they can do for immediate energy prices and they have profound differences for the long term that are not easily reconcilable
257606 right now the publics anger at washington is mainly being taken out on the party of the president
257607 and its not likely that is going in change due to congresss failure to act during the august recess

257618 the isi is a very disciplined organization manned by military officials it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda the taliban and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9 11
257619 despite our insistence no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations
257620 weve long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports
257621 there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story
257622 there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas

257627 for me the most exciting experience was to see the child in him as he would go down memory lane during each of the sittings
257628 the book highlights srks achievements in his career as well as his future plans
257629 each chapter starts with a quote from shah rukh there are so many facets of his life he personifies the best that a mother would want in her son a girlfriend would dream of in her lover a wife would want in her husband and a child would want in his father
257630 we received a tremendous response for still reading khan but priced at rs 3 000 it was beyond the reach of an srk admirer from among the masses this book is specially developed and designed keeping both the masses and classes in mind

257652 a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives
257653 i think everyones looking for a good story characters from books come with an appeal of their own like the female protagonist of my book she transcends barriers and encapsulates the female experience
257654 luckily theres less condescension from the film world towards this new trend for commercial fiction as theyve suddenly found a whole treasure trove of stories in these books that are film able and more easily recognisable to their audiences
257655 chetan bhagat is excited that salman khan plays him in the movie hello
257656 these are guys i have grown up watching and for me this is just unbelievable
257657 bhagat says hes not possessive about his script as long as people respect the story also he looks forward to newer audiences reading the book once the movie is out
257658 i wanted to hold off for a while before committing because then i would not have been in a position of control
257659 now since the book is doing well kala says directors who approach her consider her opinion more and ask whether she wants to be a part of the scriptwriting process
257660 directors werent forthcoming about movie rights so its not like banks roll for authors but once publishers and authors get savvy they will discuss and negotiate this further
257661 financially it helps authors a great deal the minimum offer i received for movie rights is a great deal higher than what ill make from the book royalties in a year although my book is already a best seller

257683 he was quick to temper and did not trust me anymore
257684 he was easygoing about talking to people now he was not social and was paranoid he thought there were people following him hed ask what is that black box on road or why did you ask me that the military expects them to turn that switch were waiting at home doing it all ourselves and they come home and add more stress its like who is this guy the kids dont know who he is holy mackerel they come back so different

257687 a neighbor shot off fireworks and it was pretty loud a trigger for paul

257690 every time one went off hed fall down i called police they understood and shut it down
257691 we ended up losing our duplex and with four kids moved to the projects in dover

257699 the idea for team gis explorer originally came from tools that we developed over the course of many gis consultancy engagements we found that uptake of arcgis desktop could be significantly increased by the addition of intuitive data access tools as they make the system much easier for both expert and occasional users to drive when we productised these tools we not only added new and unique functionality such as the ability to add data from mxd files without opening them but we also optimised the tools for the distributed data environments seen today as such team gis explorer has been designed as a tool to allow data administrators to publish their organisations gis data to arcgis desktop users while keeping the data configuration secure from update or corruption by the users

257701 during earths history a rise in co2 levels has always been accompanied by a rise in earths average temperature
257702 a deep anxiety because people do want to know moral rules to live by
257703 the ability to act on the basis of own considered will
257704 few people who survived auschwitz continued to believe in the all powerful all good heavenly father or the scriptures
257705 therefore clive hamilton seems to pick up this challenge ignore the illusions of secular prosperity and lead us to something different who would not see some value in it
257706 i think the environmental urgency he responds to forces us to new thinking about the mysteries of existence
257707 its not very fashionable to espouse religious views so hes espousing a non spiritual spirituality which leaves everyone feeling somewhat confused he didnt know the solution it seems to be to charge up with some communal force but he doesnt say what it is or what it means
257708 its the idea of the classic philosophers life where you set yourself up as critical of modern life
257709 the big issue for me is this is all about morals and has political implications that are not spelled out
257710 i dont want someone deciding political implications on the basis of their own morals which would impinge on my freedom
257711 what i would endorse is that clive hamilton is resonating with a very ancient religious and philosophical tradition
257712 i dont know how long i remained parked in front of that wall of womens magazines
257713 motionless and mesmerized in an overly lit bookstore listening to the rhythmic flip flap of pages being turned the sensation was similar to being in a las vegas casino where there are no windows or clocks and you could be playing blackjack for either ten minutes or ten years
257714 are you normal how do your sex habits sleep patterns and breakup strategies stack up against other womens take these quizzes to find out
257715 partly because the thrill was gone what had once been a guilty pleasure taken at nail and hair salons had since become a full time job i was not only reading fourteen magazines a month i was actively participating in their content checking in with faceless writers and editors at all times and constantly analyzing the results it was an exhausting way to live out a life however successful the end result
257716 the real problem is that the whole system is corrupt and its the money thats doing it it used to be that in the senate the members knew each other we had good friends on both sides of the aisle
257717 our families knew one another now as soon as the majority leader says thats it for the week everyone runs out the door and hops on a plane to go someplace usually to a fund raiser its so corrupt
257718 the marketing model if followed empties the truth out of the gospel first the needs consumers have are needs they identify for themselves the needs sinners have are needs god identifies for us and the way we see our needs is rather different from the way he sees them we suppress the truth about god holding it down in unrighteousness rom 1 18 we are not subject to his moral law and in our fallenness are incapable of being obedient to it rom 8 7 so how likely is it outside the intervention of god through the holy spirit that we will identify our needs as those arising from our rebellion against god no the product we will seek naturally will not be the gospel it will be a therapy of some kind a technique for life perhaps a way of connecting more deeply with our own spiritual selves on our own terms terms that require no repentance and no redemption it will not be the gospel the gospel cannot be a product that the church sells because there are no consumers for it when we find consumers we will find that what they are interested in buying on their own terms is not the gospel
257719 it hurts to get hit it doesnt hurt to almost get hit
257720 to develop the militarys capacity to carry out long range strikes
257721 we judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon is late 2009 but that this is very unlikely we judge with moderate confidence that iran probably would be technically capable of producing enough heu for a weapon sometime during the 2010 2015 time frame the state department bureau of intelligence and research or inr judges that iran is unlikely to achieve this capability before 2013 because of foreseeable technical and programmatic problems all agencies recognize the possibility that this capability may not be attained until after 2015
257722 the international community has a duty and responsibility to clarify to iran through drastic measures that the repercussions of their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons will be devastating
257723 haaretz 4 june in line with this retired israeli air force general isaac ben israel who took part in the bombing of iraqi nuclear plants in 1981 told the german magazine der spiegel 1 july 2008
257724 if iran continues with its program for developing nuclear weapons we will attack it
257725 a nuclear iran would pose a grave threat and the world must prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
257726 a nuclear iran would be a game changing situation not just in the middle east but the world iranians need to understand that whether its the bush administration or an obama administration that this is a paramount concern to the u s
257727 if we show ourselves willing to talk and to offer carrots and sticks in order to deal with these pressing problems and if iran then rejects any overtures of that sort it puts us in a stronger position to mobilise the international community to ratchet up pressure on iran
257728 in this situation we have to take the possibility of a military attack against iran more serious than we did previously
257729 the first u s shot against iran would set u s vital interests in the world on fire tel aviv and the u s fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in irans crushing response
257730 awtw are the u s and iran still on a collision course
257731 another war in the middle east is the last thing we need
257732 a destabilizing force throughout the middle east and southwest asia and in my judgment is hell bent on acquiring nuclear weapons
257733 no opera music no blue lights and no fake contacts

257735 i t seemed difficult for centuries of western christians to suppose that the joy of the elect could be perfect before all were gathered in the house of the father
257736 held in a kind of sweet sleep or quiet joy waiting at the
257737 place of repose in the paradise made for adam in the bosom of abraham in a secret dwelling or again
257738 i saw there beneath the altar the souls of all who had been slain for love of gods word

257740 come you that have received a blessing from my father take possession of the kingdom which has been prepared for you
257741 anxious to remain faithful to the tradition he pope john xxii studied other earlier authors but having no idea of development of doctrine as was quite excusable at the time he gathered considerably more authorities in favor of his interpretation

257743 one day i was walking toward the sea on the southern coast of crete
257744 as i walked raising my head occasionally to the sea i began to discern an unusual black shape in the distance
257745 as i came closer i slowed my pace and moved more gently over the rocks i felt that i was invading a vast serene privacy which would be shattered by my presence i held my breath as i moved closer for fear of startling the man i expected him to look up at any moment then i stopped only a few feet from the bent figure i slowly raised my camera focused composed and pressed the button he slowly raised his head looked at me calmly and said good morning
257746 most vocal critics have focused on some of its prevention strategies
257747 critics have also questioned pefpars focus on hiv care and treatment
257748 criticized for creating a vertical program with disease specific goals as well as a single donor driven structure and strategy
257749 verticality the program has also been reasonably well integrated with the global and national responses to the hiv epidemic
257750 key challenge for pepfar will be to maintain its sense of urgency and its razor sharp focus on results factors that have resulted in remarkable achievements in the face of enormous challenges
257751 the advances have been dramatic but much remains to be done
257752 served to isolate and discredit that element of american politics that refines hatred of government to a toxic purity
257753 would be a private holocaust of abandonment mourning and despair
257754 preserves the pepfar programs successful founding principles and it deserves the wide support it has achieved
257755 worth noting that the bill includes new accountability and transparency benchmarks
257756 one in four of the nations more than 590 000 bridges is rated as either in need of repair or inadequate to handle todays traffic
257757 steel concrete asphalt and earth work have increased at least 50 percent
257758 and oil has quadrupled in the last four years forcing states to delay needed repairs
257759 we need federal intervention and federal intervention at a big level
257760 my objective is that those lives lost in the i 35 bridge tragedy will not have been lost in vain that indeed the congress will act the president will sign a bill state departments of transportation will act
257761 inattention by the states to their bridge needs and sort of an overconfidence that theyve built bridges to high standards and dont need to revisit them is the principal concern i have and i think the underlying cause for escalating deteriorating bridges corrosion and metal fatigue
257762 we are going from pin to pin and doing phased array ultrasound which is a volumetric test to look for cracks or corrosion in the pins
257763 what were looking for here is something out of the ordinary
257764 typically were looking for cracks and were also looking for large areas of corrosion visual inspection would not be able to identify these areas so we need to use this volumetric test
257765 i think the bridge collapse has made bridge inspections more of a priority
257766 theres been some progress but there could be more the other area that should get attention is maintenance
257767 what we have today is crumbling and neglected infrastructure words that seem to go together all the time
257768 and the reason is weve never planned for how we should adequately pay for the use of that facility over the design life of an asset
257769 often people will hear crack on a bridge and think its ready to fall down but on a secondary member its very common and on a steel bridge probably about 90 percent have some kind of crack on them
257770 staffing shortages inadequate supplies broken and obsolete equipment and patient records including inmate requests for medical care in tatters
257771 honesty with your defense attorney is critical no one wins when it is discovered after you have announced you want a trial that the client had three convictions for the same type of offense in another state

257784 i wanted to point out everybody what life was like in iraq with the war and how the many the crowd got to school and do their normal lives with everything thats happening there

257786 we like the same movies the same music the same things

257789 this is really just about living this is about how people live through this crazy insane time
257790 everyones talking about the future but we never talk with the future thats really what this film is they are the future of iraq
257791 i want people to take away from this film that theres a lot of hope
257792 they just want to live like altogether the other peoples they just do their best to be civilized
257793 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last obscurity and agreed
257794 internet use will have existence just like in any one olympics
257795 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
257796 it is only inevitable for people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one some other on some different issues
257797 the ioc and the chinese body politic i think are the ones to be held accountable here i think the blame related for anything related to the politicization of the olympics really falls on their shoulders
257798 wholly in all chinas security forces are confident and capable of securing the olympic games
257799 im disconcerted sad and its an ugly thing for the world of fencing

257806 why does cote divoire have 76 religions while norway has 13 and why does brazil have 159 religions while canada has 15 even though in both comparisons the countries are similar in size
257807 i think we all know that history doesnt tell the whole story that its told from the side of the victor but britain from around 1485 to 1700 is a case where you can see this making of history being done in a very deliberate way to very specific ends to justify a new regime the tudor dynasty to justify a new church after the english reformation and so on it also happens that this period is where a lot of british and american institutions find their origins so its important to know where they come from

257812 moldon challenged the legality of using eminent domain to take his land for no apparent public use since the city of las vegas only planned on transferring selling it to the stratosphere for future expansion
257813 the moldons are entitled to the interest earned on the condemnation deposit because they had a property interest in the condemnation deposit the district court clerks act of placing the interest earned from the condemnation deposit into clark countys general fund caused a taking in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments consequently former nrs 355 210 was unconstitutionally applied to allow such takings accordingly we reverse the district courts order providing that the moldons were not entitled to the interest earned on the condemnation deposit and we remand this matter to the district court so that the district court may determine the amount of interest owed to the moldons on the condemnation deposit

257861 theres likely to be a fair amount of time between now and when that event actually takes place and thats a time period in which we intend to generate a very significant amount of capital

257863 many people have argued that having a legitimate hypervisor installed prevents installation of virtualization based malware we will show that this is not the case
257864 years ago other vendors tried to downplay the importance of microsoft windows kernel rootkits saying that one needed to already be an administrator in order to install one as we know over the last couple of years kernel rootkits became a very serious security problem
257865 it is automatically created when the system boots and does a lot of the management of the system it builds all of the other user domains and manages all of their virtual devices
257866 the subverting techniques we will be presenting at black hat indeed assume that the attacker first obtained access to domain 0
257867 domain 0 being an administrative domain requires certain services to be run inside it one such service is an secure shell daemon this makes the attack surface on domain 0 quite large
257868 over the last year it has been shown that domain 0 is far from being bulletproof with our presentations we take the game to the new level by studying how to compromise the hypervisor and what we can do to prevent it
257869 we will show how to bypass those protections and subvert xen hypervisor memory
257870 were going to see how it is presented shes done some really cool stuff in the past but in this case i dont see this applying to all of xen
257871 there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that dr hatfill had anything to do with this

257876 since the founding of the republic we have had broad authority to conduct searches at the border to prevent the entrance into this country of dangerous persons and goods
257877 in the 21st century the most dangerous contraband is most often contained in electronic media not on paper the age of micro fiches and paper files is long over
257878 detain documents and electronic devices for a reasonable period of time to perform a thorough border search on site or at an off site location
257879 in the course of a border search and absent individualized suspicion officers can review and analyze the information transported by any individual attempting to enter reenter depart pass through or reside in the united states

257890 por eso creo que todos con mucha tranquilidad con mucha serenidad pero tambi n con mucha profundidad y responsabilidad debemos mirar todo lo que nos rodea
257891 lo que nos pas no para lamentarnos o acusarnos simplemente para saber cu l es el camino acertado en materia pol tica econ mica y social
257892 no quiere decir que todos seamos homog neos que todos repitamos exactamente la misma marchita o cantemos al un sono no para nada
257893 hay que saber por d nde pasa esa historia nacional y popular la de los grandes intereses la que representa a los intereses de los chicos de los trabajadores de los intelectuales de los empresarios de los comerciantes para no equivocarse

257912 el cne no tiene absolutamente nada que expresar en ese sentido

257916 this has been a very exciting demo selection cycle and will undoubtedly lead to an extraordinary demofall event not only did we receive an overwhelming response from potential demonstrators but the caliber of products weve selected introduces a new phase in technology

257926 we are very close to the family of james te aute and the other victims in this trial and part of it was relief on out part on their behalf
257927 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal
257928 there are deficiencies in the summing up and other matters
257929 there are always issues involved and there are some particular issues in this case there are some substantial ones
257930 at the end of the day the question is has the person received a fair trial if there are deficiencies in the summing up and the way it proceeds the defence is entitled to proceed and i am saying there are matters to be canvassed
257931 it was incredibly complex evidence and the most complex summing up i have ever heard a judge have to give to get through the other end of a second trial is a hell of a relief
257932 it was the toughest summing up i think would confront any judge in this country

257945 the pulse enjoys a loyal following among a hard to reach audience
257946 we plan to continue the kind of intelligent witty and occasionally irreverent reporting that the pulse is so well known for delivering
257947 weve already built a popular portfolio with brewer radios wjtt fm wmpz fm whjk fm and walv fm along with the chattanooga traffic network our web media includes www chattanoogahascars com www chattanoogahastravel com www chattanoogahasfun com and now www chattanoogapulse com the pulse gives us a newsprint presence on the streets in more than 240 distribution points all over chattanooga its unique position as chattanoogas alternative weekly is a powerful addition
257948 brewer media group is a fantastic match for the pulse
257949 we are confident that together we will continue to serve up the kind of content our readers expect at the same time brewers multi media approach offers a powerful and compelling proposition for advertisers were going to be able to offer our local regional and national advertisers a variety of options to reach their targeted audience
257950 political climates and cultural climates kind of go together that was a more conservative era in lots of ways

257953 im not telling you how to vote but you should know that if republicans win in november then we may face massive budget cuts so that some of you may lose your jobs or take pay cuts and you may be forced to work under more difficult conditions now remember im not telling you how to vote but you should understand that this is what will happen if republicans win the election

257960 lo que hay que reformar es la pol tica no la justicia
257961 crea un club cerrado que se auto perpet a a trav s de sus sucesores y cierra la posibilidad de relevo a quienes no son allegados al c rculo es antidemocr tico y revive el clientelismo convierte a la corte en un feudo de varios niveles la c pula los magistrados de las cortes en el medio los magistrados de tribunal y en la base los jueces
257962 la sentencia considera constitucional que en el futuro se presente ese cambio la separaci n de los procesos pero eso se puede hacer con la simple reforma al estatuto de administraci n de la justicia que es una norma del c digo de procedimiento penal el gobierno fue m s all de la sentencia de la corte no hay una urgencia evidente para el cambio que s puede traer consecuencias grav simas

257964 la corte suprema es la llamada a juzgar a los congresistas porque en el estado de derecho el legislativo debe ser juzgado por la cabeza m xima de la justicia los organismos m ximos investigan a los organismos m ximos el hecho de que al cuerpo legislativo lo investigue un tribunal que no tiene la misma entidad sino que est un escal n abajo en el estado de derecho lastima el sistema de pesos y contrapesos y el alcance democr tico
257965 coincido con la suprema en que es totalmente inoportuno formular una reforma a la justicia cuando se adelante una investigaci n a buena parte del congreso
257966 inconveniente e inoportuno emprender en este momento hist rico una reforma a la justicia cuando la corte suprema adelanta investigaciones y juicios en contra de algunos congresistas por el denominado proceso de la parapol tica

257968 the fact that more people in the united states are infected with hiv every year than previously thought shows that we need to be working much harder to control the epidemic in the united states
257969 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
257970 these new figures from the cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response we call on the federal government to renew its commitment to prevention care and research into the hiv aids epidemic in the united states
257971 when the fracture results in nanoplates it leads to a low level of fracture energy at a certain size resulting in a size specific fracture
257972 it also may prove useful in the deliberate creation of large quantities of stable nanostructures
257973 thus the phonon confinement should occur instantaneously as the crack propagates
257974 this could have important consequences not only for small materials but also for the way cracks propagate in nanostructured bulk materials
257975 not many people have thought seriously about the interactions between a superfluid and a superconductor that are co existing like this
257976 we found that the boundary wasnt just shifted but new behavior appeared when the superconductor is on the edge between type i and type ii
257977 we were surprised that there was anything new to mine here
257978 but slightly different behavior thats the next step in our research and its already being done which is pretty neat
257979 this protective effect suggests that a public health measure aimed at preventing development of myopia could be based on increasing the engagement of children in outdoor activity

257988 were going to see what he can do at third we want to give him every opportunity to play and get comfortable in our system hes going to be our third baseman now
257989 im just going to keep preparing myself and hopefully im in the lineup as much as possible im just going to keep doing my job
257990 nothing against l a but i was the utility guy or the one just coming in to pinch hit
257991 coming here i get the chance to be an everyday player ill get the chance to earn a spot and be an everyday player
257992 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
257993 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
257994 we lost probably one of the best players in baseball
257995 he does everything for you he goes out and plays hurt he shows up every day and hes a great person inside the clubhouse
257996 aside from being a good player he was a fun person to be around ever since ive been in the big leagues ive played with him i learned a lot from his professionalism hell certainly be missed
257997 its something i try not to think about or dwell on but its certainly something that im going to miss
257998 i think the easiest way to look at it is that my job as a player isnt to run the organization or evaluate trades thats what neal and president frank coonelly and the scouts are paid to do we just have to have faith in them that they do their job to the best of their ability and then we do our job on the field
257999 we understood coming in this year that this was the team that we were coming in with and if we didnt win then it would be taken apart
258000 we knew that this is what was going to happen
258001 its tough being the guy that has been here through all of these rebuilding molds
258002 its tough to see so many good players that have been here and are now with other clubs doing well
258003 every time we made a trade it was one big dent
258004 theres a much different feeling than ive had before on the day of the deadline because this year there were three big guys it makes it much harder
258005 they are doing things for a reason and you have to trust that they are making the right decisions and hopefully everything works out and they made the right deals and they got the right players
258006 but its tough it seems like were losing all our offense from a pitching standpoint its just seemed like every day we had a chance to come back and that we always had a good chance to score some runs and win any game hopefully we wont skip a beat
258007 if thats the route they want to take thats their decision
258008 were still going to try and go out and get wins every day it would have been nice to keep them but theyre building toward the future we understand the concept
258009 sometimes you dont know if youre going to be here
258010 right now its building toward the future but who knows some of us might not be here
258011 hes all you can ask for want in a teammate this is part of baseball but its not fun
258012 i dont remember much i had used too much drugs
258013 we are going to be taken now to a london police station from there my mum can get her head together and get her thoughts together
258014 gt macredia flash mx serial code torrentsyt a gt url
258015 because greenland is so far away and its hard to comprehend theres not really snow to speak of here let alone a big chunk of ice
258016 we really want them to be able to talk to the researchers and hear from them what theyre out there doing what theyre seeing what theyre learning and get a sense thats really going on right now and they could do that when they grow up
258017 it looks like what happens they fill up during the spring and then at some point during the summer theres enough water in that lake that it fractures all the way to the bottom of the ice sheet thats a kilometer of ice and the water spreads out and it changes the velocity of the ice moving just a little bit but when you have a lot of lakes doing that it adds up the whole ice sheet moves at a different velocity during the summer than during the winter
258018 a lot of the conservation efforts at least in recent years have been very good i sometimes wonder if we dug ourselves in too deep of a hole
258019 i tried to be lenient with them but wanted to punish them
258020 i wanted to show them there was a better way than the way they were going
258021 i am not after money i am after their attention
258022 i want them to realize the importance of a good name and reputation
258023 here are the tools you need to do the job i have for you i know youre weak so i put padding on the yoke before i lay it on your shoulders but youre still going to have to pull and it will be uphill both ways sometimes but ill be there ill always be there i always was
258024 the church doesnt seem to know what it wants to be
258025 before this was the best place but now its like a prison when i watch tv everything is lies so i walk in the streets where the soldiers ask for my identity papers if theres the smallest mistake youre finished we should be tolerant but we cant be tolerant any more
258026 broke down five doors checked everything threw it all on the floor and hit everyone present it was like a burglary
258027 at first i thought they were going to kill me they gave us half a steamed bun a day everyone was very thirsty and a lot of people drank their own urine we had no clothes no blankets nothing to lie down on and it was very cold for four days nobody spoke to us they just left us there
258028 im very worried about the monks the soldiers regard them as something very different i cant understand why they do terrible things to monks
258029 i met an old man who had two ribs broken
258030 afterwards he said that hed done all kinds of things that happens to a lot of people they pressure people to admit things they never did many questions were asked of people who are not guilty of anything they are just guilty of being tibetan
258031 i have a relative in india i wrote just what i heard and saw to send over the internet i wrote a little and saved it on word all of a sudden it disappeared so i was very frightened so i havent checked my e mail i have a lot of friends abroad and they send many e mails but i havent opened them
258032 in prison i sometimes dreamed about food i would remember my mothers and my sisters cooking and i really appreciated how tasty the food is at home
258033 these are the worst things that ive ever seen in my life
258034 more than 150 tibetans were arrested after they tried to march on to the chinese embassys consular section
258035 we expect most of them to be released by friday night
258036 we are fulfilling a promise to provide good working conditions for reporters covering the olympic games
258037 we always have been following international law on such matters
258038 we urge the international olympic committee to exert pressure on china so that those attending the games and ordinary chinese citizens can enjoy freedom of expression and movement
258039 i was driving through on my way home and they had the checkpoint up i was summoned to pull over so i pulled over they explained what they were doing
258040 i told him i was glad they were in the neighborhood and wished they could do it more often
258041 it saddens me to hear these people are being killed literally for nothing
258042 im sure it will get much worse before it gets better i want to run away but where will i run to
258043 there is no constitutional requirement for a president to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
258044 no one disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time
258045 that is every presidents prerogative but abrogating a published executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law
258046 because the published order stays on the books it actively misleads congress and the public as to what the law is
258047 if the president revokes modifies waives or suspends a published executive order or similar directive notice of this change in the law must be placed in the federal register within 30 days the notice must specify the order or the provision that has been affected whether the change is a revocation a modification a waiver or a suspension and the nature and circumstances of the change
258048 the bill does not require the publication of classified information about intelligence sources and methods or similar information the basic fact that the published law is no longer in effect however cannot be classified
258049 on rare occasions national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret
258050 but it can never justify lying to the american people about what the law is maintaining two different sets of laws one public and one secret is just that deceiving the american people about what law applies to the governments conduct
258051 to be honest its sheer luck if a security officer spots something in an environment like that
258052 if you get a security manager alone behind closed doors a lot of them laugh about what a waste of money it is
258053 it works a lot like the behavioral software that many it people use on their networks
258054 it establishes a baseline of activity and then sends alerts when there are anomalies the big difference is that until now there was no way to do this kind of analysis on video images because the data collected by the cameras wasnt machine readable we had to invent a way to do that
258055 if youre monitoring a busy highway where traffic comes and goes frequently on a regular basis the software learns very quickly
258056 if youre monitoring an outdoor fence line when the camera sees only three or four actions all day it will take longer
258057 the great thing about it is that you dont need a human to monitor the camera at all
258058 we think a three to one ratio of alerts to actual events is what the market will accept
258059 what weve seen so far is enterprises spending billions on video surveillance equipment but having a lot of trouble proving a return on investment
258060 what were doing is helping them to get more out of that equipment
258061 we are concerned that user generated video content on sites such as youtube does not carry any age classification nor is there a watershed before which it cannot be shown
258062 we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users
258063 given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly
258064 we need urgently to find a consensus about the standards of the future standards to help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving world if we are to protect young people
258065 democrats are avoiding bringing up the bills and have since late june to prevent a series of votes on energy issues designed to open new areas for oil exploration with gas prices hovering near 4 a gallon republicans pushing what they call their all of the above energy plan think they have found a political issue that works to their benefit instead of taking the votes on which republicans likely would have prevailed obey adjourned the committee and he has not answered repeated questions about when or if the hearing would continue this is the meat of our legislative responsibility here in congress said michael steel spokesman for house minority leader john boehner they have shut down the process based entirely on their fear that we would get a vote on energy issues since then obey has not brought up measures on which republicans could offer similar amendments intent on avoiding similar votes when lewis offered to refrain from trying to amend other appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on the interior measure obey did not respond

258082 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
258083 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
258084 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
258085 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
258086 i think it started with dwight early in the game he got it going on the defensive end which led over to the offensive end once he holds it down in the middle like that we feed off of that
258087 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
258088 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him
258089 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
258090 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
258091 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
258092 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
258093 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
258094 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
258095 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
258096 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
258097 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end

258167 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
258168 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he mr holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
258169 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends

258249 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
258250 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
258251 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
258252 the connection between music and sports has never been stronger
258253 sports is entertainment as an agency that creates unique entertainment brand experiences we felt that this break through model where music meets sports was something that we wanted to get behind immediately
258254 as an avid music enthusiast im happy to team with wemix com to discover talented new artists and find a song that best reflects me
258255 im also excited about opening new avenues that support my efforts to encourage kids to play the game of baseball the number of african american major league players has dramatically decreased over the last 10 years and were hoping that projects such as this will reverse that trend and get more minority kids into the game
258256 im a huge fan of baseball and sports and i truly support what torii is doing through his foundation
258257 this is a fantastic opportunity for wemix to spread that positive message excite fans around the country and make great new music at the same time

258377 chrysler llc today announced that in spite of the severe economic and industry challenges we continue to perform ahead of our financial plan for the second quarter and first half of 2008
258378 the company remains ahead of its financial plan due primarily to chryslers fast response to the deteriorating market conditions and its cost reduction initiatives launched in 2007 focused largely on restructuring its operations
258379 chryslers negative product mix largely driven by trucks and suvs was off set in the first half with a positive mix which includes the effects from substantially reduced fleet sales the effects of new products the all new chrysler and dodge minivans dodge journey and jeep liberty and the elimination of unprofitable models chrysler pt cruiser convertible pacifica and crossfire and the dodge magnum

258392 in july we saw strong performance once again in our launch products including the cadillac cts chevrolet malibu saturn astra and pontiac vibe and g8 in addition we continued to see strong retail demand for our fuel efficient chevrolet aveo and hhr saturn vue and buick enclave so despite an overall weak market there are pockets of strength
258393 obviously the weakness in the truck market persisted in july yet we continue to hold share due to our fuel economy leadership in many truck segments despite dramatic competitive incentive spending increases

258404 subaru products represent the best all around package in the auto industry and provide smart alternatives to traditional truck based suvs

258406 we are writing a new chapter in the auto industry story as customers dealers and companies adjust to a changing environment
258407 there are many changes taking place that give us at the new chrysler cause for optimism in the short term our 2009 model year vehicles with value packages will soon be arriving in dealerships and our august incentive packages are the best deals of the year helping to make owning as affordable as leasing within the product lineup our leadership in minivans is well timed as consumers look for fuel efficient alternatives to larger suvs two new fuel saving hybrid suvs the dodge durango and chrysler aspen will be soon hitting the streets the dodge journey and jeep patriot are gaining more customers on the appeal of fuel efficiency and affordability and the success of cars like the dodge avenger charger and challenger shows that customers still want their cars to stand out from the crowd lastly this fall we come to market with our best new pickup truck ever the 2009 dodge ram
258408 there are some democrats who think things are going to look a lot different in the makeup of the next congress and why dont we just wait until we are more advantaged
258409 its my hope that theyll come back in september chastened by their constituents and ready to work with republicans on tackling the facing this nation
258410 expanding access to americas abundant diverse and currently locked away energy resources
258411 are here to protect the interests of the oil companies plain and simple
258412 republicans in the congress and the president dont want to do any of the things that would have an impact on gas prices immediately
258413 our country faces a critical challenge because of skyrocketing energy costs
258414 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us
258415 im never confident they will do anything and im normally right
258416 when we began this process last year even our own members thought taking on car manufacturers was daunting
258417 but they came to understand this is an issue of survival for them and for their customers when the manufacturers fail to provide us equal access to that information the consumers are directly and negatively impacted
258418 i was in dozens of meetings with representatives from all corners of the state and i can tell you that they understand that this is a consumer issue first and then an economic issue about jobs in this economy
258419 the car manufacturers know better but they dont have any other defense for their opposition because this is a pro consumer bill
258420 what else would they say that they are anti consumer
258421 there is much credible evidence that automakers and importers are holding back data
258422 but we think that tide will turn first here in massachusetts
258423 while we see the premium segment being affected by the same economic conditions as the mainstream market there continue to be less dramatic consequences in this segment
258424 buyers of our vehicles are still shopping and purchasing but are even more discerning to choose for long term quality and value in light of our corporate results announced today we are going to strengthen our focus on profitability over the next 12 to 18 months by keeping the supply of vehicles in close alignment with demand which in turn increases our pricing flexibility and brand value actions we are already taking include shifting our customer programs in our dealerships to achieve a more equitable balance of retail financing to leasing further emphasizing the benefits of our four year free maintenance program and further developing our certified pre owned business to aid residual values
258425 again this month we continue to watch a very large movement from larger to smaller vehicles from the increased traffic in our dealerships we are seeing desires to downsize but not downscale
258426 over the last month our mini sales have also seen on average 4 5 000 of options in a typical sale therefore at least in the premium end of the small car market small size is not equating to small dollar sales
258427 although accent and elantra sales continued their upward trend with increases of 96 percent and 31 percent respectively over the same period last year we experienced an overall slow down for the month of july
258428 we are encouraged going forward however due to the fact we have recently opened a new four cylinder engine plant in montgomery alabama allowing us to shift our engine mix for future product we also expect greater availability of our more fuel efficient vehicles in the months to come and the demand for our new rear wheel drive genesis to continue to rise
258429 focus continues to surprise and delight customers throughout the country but the bombshell is in texas where focus retail sales have almost doubled
258430 if we can increase small car sales in texas we can increase them anywhere
258431 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
258432 our focus is cash flow and liquidity that is our focus
258433 despite the negative pace of sales across the industry audi continues to outperform the market
258434 theres been positive consumer reaction to our products and there is a growing enthusiasm for the forthcoming launch of the all new a4 in addition to the beautiful vehicles and the excellent technology i think consumers are finding that audi offers a portfolio of german engineered vehicles that deliver strong fuel economy performance
258435 for volkswagen to be ahead of last years sales in this tough economy reflects the strength of our brand our new products launching later this year are sure to give us even greater momentum

258446 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
258447 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
258448 at an average cost of 7 699 per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million annually
258449 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs
258450 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
258451 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of
258452 oh well that figures i wasnt using the no follow attribute
258453 these tools let you choose how to develop pagerank amongst your pages
258454 it is my belief that using the nofollow with the purpose of controlling the flow of links or link juice is a gigantic red flag in the eyes of the engines
258455 this link has no interest at all dont bother evaluating how tiny it is its zero
258456 yes webmasters can feel free to use nofollow internally to help tell googlebot which pages they want to receive link juice from other pages
258457 like you appear to im in favor of white hat techniques and practice them regularly as such i dont use nofollows to pass or control link benefits in a static content environment nofollow attributes on a link were intended to prevent user generated spam not for you the rheotorical you to control what pages on your site are most worthy of your link juice
258458 now if theyre reusing that information in webmaster central could they not also use that in their algorithms
258459 you definitely do not want to use the attribute on links to your own pages do that and youll deprive your own pages from the chance of influencing how your other pages rank
258460 think of it as a way to flag to them
258461 im willing to bet that the only person to know about the nofollow is involved in seo this represents a fundamental flaw with the use of the nofollow
258462 this is a text to see if google looks at link text in a nofollow
258463 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism
258464 this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
258465 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease

258467 a step towards ascertaining the effects of phytoestrogens on developing fetuses and newborns
258468 is organized by hormones during development which is the neonatal stage for rats and during gestation for humans
258469 these findings reinforce the fact that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy
258470 prenatal exposure to alcohol especially excessive amounts at one time can adversely affect the fetus and may increase the risk of infant clefts
258471 the greater the blood alcohol concentration the longer the fetus is exposed a single binge during a critical period of an infants development can be harmful
258472 fortunately heavy maternal drinking is uncommon in many populations but the fact that it is happening at all tells us we need to do a better job of letting mothers know about the effects that alcohol can have on their babys development
258473 at the moment there are a great many people with hepatitis c who have no treatment options left and it would transform their lives if we could prevent them from developing liver failure we are looking forward to seeing the results of our upcoming trial in humans now that weve had such promising results in the trial in mice
258474 if we have positive results from the new trial we will have a potential treatment that is already available and very cheap and which should be safe enough for people to take if we are successful in hepatitis c patients we are hopeful that such treatment might benefit people with liver damage from other causes and this is something we would be keen to study further

258508 i think hes going to win i like that hes opening up conversations all over the world i think hes smart and charismatic i think its important to have a president that people actually like itll be nice when people like america again
258509 nobody thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
258510 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
258511 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
258512 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
258513 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
258514 we want to have a serious debate but so far weve been hearing about paris hilton and britney spears
258515 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what the election is about is that worthy of the american people

258520 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
258521 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

258523 i dont know whether a parunthu flies over money or not
258524 its definitely more useful than no data which was ridiculous but the reports are a bit sparse at the moment
258525 if i can interpret it if youve got a small company in israel who doesnt have a pervasive workforce around the world maybe theyve got two major markets for their product so they rely on the technology because they dont have as many people on the ground
258526 you cant be lazy with these systems the worst sin in intelligence is that someone hands you an analysis and you dont explore the cause of that analysis
258527 its not as if the technology is going to change a companys direction but it will help shape how they view the world
258528 when these packages work well theyre very good at filtering the noise out of the marketplace for management

258575 ill tell you who should be tortured and killed at guantanamo every filthy democrat in the u
258576 liberals teach our children multiculturalism rather than american culture revisionist history rather than american history the thinly disguised religion of secular humanism and extreme environmentalism rather than capitalism they train our young to criticize america not celebrate it they welcome condoms into the classroom but ban god and the ten commandments they encourage tolerance for the teachings of the koran but not for the teachings of jesus christ they oppose the pledge of allegiance tell us that god is dead that christianity is for losers and that evangelical and catholic conservatives are more dangerous than radical islamic militants they tell us that fuel burning suvs are bad for america but flag burning sobs arent but they are wrong and it is time to ask why particularly in time of war should we entrust the education of our children to people who loathe and ravage so many of out core values and traditions
258577 t hey can have the gay scouts if they want if they dont like the values of the boy scouts
258578 this is the moment to say that there are things in life worth fighting and dying for and one of em is making sure nancy pelosi doesnt become the house speaker

258584 in order for me to believe that god was sending america a message i would need to be shown that the people who died tuesday were all members of the now gang or abortionists civil libertarians et cetera
258585 because we are sympathetic we are compassionate people we have responded by letting our government literally feed these people to the point of obesity at least here in america didnt teach them how to fish we gave them the fish didnt teach them how to butcher a slaughter a cow to get the butter we gave them the butter the real bloat here as we know is in is in government

258594 conservative people tend to see the world in black and white terms good and evil liberals see grays in any talk format you have to pound home a strong point of view if youre not providing controversy and excitement people wont listen or watch
258595 many parents are worried in america about the gay agenda and indoctrination of their children to see homosexuality in a certain way
258596 i dont want to go on a lynching party against michelle obama unless theres evidence hard facts that say this is how the woman really feels
258597 if anyone understood what hindus really believe there would be no doubt that they have no business administering government policies
258598 how can there be peace when drunkards drug dealers communists atheists new age worshippers of satan secular humanists oppressive dictators greedy money changers revolutionary assassins adulterers and homosexuals are on top
258599 when lawlessness is abroad in the land the same thing will happen here that happened in nazi germany many of those people involved with adolph hitler were satanists many of them were homosexuals the two things seem to go together
258600 feminism encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians

258606 to fight only the al qaeda scum is to miss the terrorist network operating within our own borders who are these traitors every rotten radical left winger in this country thats who
258607 but the question is whats good enough for you you wanna live in a country like this where a gang of liberal judges hijack any law they dont like and hold you hostage to it they make homosexual wedding the law of the land when 90 percent of the american people find it repugnant and sickening and disgusting and dont wanna accept it and dont wanna live in a degenerate nation
258608 carl levin and ted kennedy and hillary clinton the new yorker cbs have destroyed the war effort against terror and if god forbid a suitcase bomb goes off youll know who to blame im hey im not going to mince words theres no grey zone here its black and white its them versus us and the enemy within on their side
258609 i dont know why we dont use a bunker buster bomb when he comes to the u n and just take iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad out with everyone in there
258610 my fear is that if the democrats win in the november midterm elections and im afraid that they might youre going to see america melt down faster that you could ever imagine it will happen overnight and it could lead to the breakup of the united states of america the way the soviet union broke up
258611 i want you to let a wave of intolerance wash over you i want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you yes hate is good
258612 the world will not know how to live or which direction to go without the churchs biblical influence on its theories laws actions and institutions
258613 overnight youll have the court saying homosexual marriage is a protected right i would callit a bliztkrieg of the homosexual juggernaut its not an erosion its a frontal assault on decency and morality
258614 thats when i pushed my mother and daughter to the floor and got under the pew when i saw the men rushing him was when i got up to join them
258615 i was there with our 2 year old and heard the first shot
258616 our daughter had come out on the stage then another shot and i saw jamie pushing people down to the floor i looked right outside the window of the room and the man was standing right there with a rifle shooting i grabbed the baby and dropped to the floor against the door so that he couldnt see or be able to come in if he tried to
258617 he wouldnt have left them if they were injured i was very thankful that my family was safe but my heart is breaking for the families that were not
258618 our 6 year old was very very upset lots of crying and she had blood all over her dress and her arms and legs

258621 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
258622 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
258623 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
258624 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
258625 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
258626 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could save just as much
258627 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
258628 this is an actual monster some sort of rodent like creature with a dinosaur beak a government animal testing facility is close by
258629 but unless the government is trying to design horrible montauk monsters that will eat i e d s and fart fire at bad iraqis were not sure why they would create such an unthinkable beast
258630 i ate one of those things once they dont taste bad
258631 this is exactly how i imagine karl rove looks on the inside
258632 the montauk monster lives a productive life as a beaked pig on a beach in montauk
258633 in photos there appeared to be a beak it was just a tricky angle its a dead raccoon thats what it is its undoubtedly a raccoon the same teeth paws the right size
258634 it is friday afternoon i have been busting my butt all week lighten up

258641 engaged in bizarre antics that your average zegna clad washington lobbyist would never have dreamed of
258642 even when conservatives are in power they refuse to adopt the psychology of an establishment
258643 operates in washington like the head of a small occupying army of insurgents hes an alien in the realm of the governing class given a green card by voters
258644 reputation as one of the most innovative of the national conservative youth leaders
258645 it is not our job to seek peaceful coexistence with the left our job is to remove them from power permanently
258646 there was so much money ready for conservative organizations in the united states
258647 to be the youth arm of the republican national committee
258648 our nation is in grave danger of sliding into another depression
258649 dedicated group of young leaders understand what must be done to return economic prosperity to america

258654 craig williamson was the scum of the twentieth century he murdered friends of mine i spit on the ground he walks on
258655 we can now go to students at harvard and say there is now a secure retirement plan for republican operatives
258656 im so happy to have you for my big brother sister
258657 you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
258658 the connection between music and sports has never been stronger
258659 sports is entertainment as an agency that creates unique entertainment brand experiences we felt that this break through model where music meets sports was something that we wanted to get behind immediately
258660 as an avid music enthusiast im happy to team with wemix com to discover talented new artists and find a song that best reflects me
258661 im also excited about opening new avenues that support my efforts to encourage kids to play the game of baseball the number of african american major league players has dramatically decreased over the last 10 years and were hoping that projects such as this will reverse that trend and get more minority kids into the game
258662 im a huge fan of baseball and sports and i truly support what torii is doing through his foundation
258663 this is a fantastic opportunity for wemix to spread that positive message excite fans around the country and make great new music at the same time
258664 make no mistake grifter we are indeed superheroes but youre suggesting we play by their rules who can destroy whom through nothing more than mindless brute force might makes right these antiquated conflicts are a drain on our culture these staring contests only impede evolution its a shame the authority cant see that whats occuring now cannot possibly last these things never do and so our involvement could only complicate matters unnecessarily in my opinion
258665 just what do you think a superhero is anyway you think a superhero makes
258666 predictable is this what its come to physical confrontation between two parties that are conceptually speaking in total agreement
258667 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
258668 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
258669 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
258670 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
258671 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
258672 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
258673 der teilnehmerrekord zeigt wie viel bewegung in der gr nderszene ist

258675 theres hardly a difference considering the people are so warm
258676 people from both countries want that the borders should be opened
258677 while sikander is all for coming back to india time and again to work here wali would love to settle with his family if india gives him a 10 year visa
258678 hopefully because of the fliers that our volunteers will carry americans will come to us by themselves
258679 many americans do their shopping at khan market on saturday mornings
258680 there are thousands of unregistered voters in this city and this morning were hoping to catch a few of them
258681 there are many who are interested in the american elections and many americans have indian spouses so everyones invited
258682 we were reacting to what barack obama himself said about john mccain
258683 and i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics and i think that was fair well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist weve seen this happen before and weve not going to let it happen to us
258684 he said it to a crowd in rural missouri 99 percent white
258685 there were all kinds of press there nobody reported it as a racial comment nobody certainly said what rick davis just said that he called john mccain a racist the only time this became an issue was when rick davis and their campaign decided to kick it up and make it a racial issue and thats exactly what theyve been running a negative campaign for weeks
258686 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
258687 afraid of me because im not like all those other presidents on our currency
258688 why can obama do this and mccain cant do that blah blah blah
258689 he swept through the primaries using nothing more than empty rhetoric and racial identiy politics
258690 why is it ok for obama to point out that hes black but its not ok for mccain to point out that obama is black seems like a double standard to me posted by patrickg august 1 2008 3 42 pm
258691 wahhh obama gets to speak in front of hundreds of thousands of people while i have to ride in a golf cart with a guy whos older than me but somehow looks younger
258692 wahhh obamas making fun of how ridiculous my ad is
258693 wahhh obamas calling me a racist just like he did to hillary wahhh i want my ba ba
258694 the best equal opportunity employer in america is the united states military
258695 i dont look like all of the presidents on the dollar bill
258696 playing the race card is an idiomatic phrase referring to an allegation raised against a person who has brought the issue of race or racism into a debate perhaps to obfuscate the matter
258697 in the second context it refers to someone exploiting prejudice against another race for political or some other advantage
258698 the best employer in america is the united states military
258699 the best equal opportunity employer in america is the united states military
258700 look like all of the other presidents on the dollar bill
258701 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
258702 played the race card from the bottom of the deck

259228 the greek exemplifies the etymological figure of speech by which to similar words one of them often a proper name were taken to be similar in meaning this belief was sanctioned by the supertition that a proper name could contain an omen of its owners destiny so in other greek tragedies ai as ajax is compelled by fate to cry out ai ai in agony and pentheus is reduced to tragic grief penthos
259229 the name of andreia seems to imply a battle this battle is in the world of existence and according to the doctrine of flux is only the counterflux enantia rhon if you extract the delta from andreia the name at once signifies the thing and you may clearly understand that andreia is not the stream opposed to every stream but only to that which is contrary to justice for otherwise courage would not have been praised the words arren male and aner man also contain a similar allusion to the same principle of the upward flux te ano rhon gune woman i suspect to be the same word as goun birth thelu female appears to be partly derived from thele the teat because the teat is like rain and makes things flourish tethelenai

259232 some believe that the day is called agonal because the sheep do not come to the altar but are driven agantur others think the ancients called this festival agnalia of the lambs dropping a letter from its usual place or because the victim fears the knife mirrored in the water the day might be so called from the creatures agony it may also be that the day has a greek name from the games agones that were held in former times and in ancient speech agonia meant a sheep and this last reason in my judgement is the truth

259346 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
259347 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different

259352 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
259353 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
259354 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
259355 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
259356 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
259357 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
259358 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
259359 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat

259364 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
259365 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder

259371 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
259372 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

259403 este individuo como a todos los ciudadanos al presidente del gobierno le genera una sensaci n perfectamente entendible de desprecio
259404 el gobierno sabe y por tanto se siente muy pr ximo a los que tienen dificultades m s directamente y sabe que estas dificultades las vamos a tener por un tiempo por unos meses pero tambi n el gobierno sabe que tenemos una fortaleza como pa s para garantizar la protecci n social y para mantener la fuerza inversora que nos permita hacer una recuperaci n de la econom a espa ola
259405 he trasladado a su majestad el rey que el gobierno est poniendo todos los medios a su alcance y tomando las iniciativas de que dispone para hacer frente al frenazo econ mico y a los efectos del frenazo que tiene que ver con el aumento del desempleo y con la tensi n que produce la subida de precios
259406 va a poner todos los recursos p blicos de que dispone que afortunadamente es un volumen importante porque hemos sabido ahorrar en los periodos de bonanza para mantener las pol ticas de protecci n social y de apoyo social
259407 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous polls show the public overwhelmingly doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their cell phones on increasingly over packed airplanes however with internet access just around the corner on u s flights it wont be long before the ban on voice communications on in flight planes is lifted the hang up act would ensure that financially strapped airlines dont drive us towards this noisome disruption in search of further revenue

259409 once again the democratic leadership is giddy about yet another smoking gun
259410 this has democrats dancing in the streets kind of like they were with news of a delay in the federal response to hurricane katrina which they gleefully attributed to republican racism
259411 lets not overlook that republicans dont have a real majority on the committee as several of the gop committee members are decidedly antiwar and the staffer for one of them sen chuck hagel is reputedly a strong democrat partisan having worked on sen kerrys presidential campaign
259412 the democrats have continually politicized the committee especially with this latest release
259413 jayussi started to plan for the operation in iraq where he had moved to from afghanistan he received direct orders from his leader abu mussab al zarqawi to whom jayussi had pledged allegiance and absolute obedience since he met him in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
259414 two explosions a traditional one and a chemical in an area of two square kilometers
259415 the chemical explosion would lead to the emission of poisonous chemical gasses which would have caused physical deformities and direct injuries to the lungs and eyesight
259416 outside this circle the human loss would amount to around 80 000 people dead and 160 000 injured

259467 we have such confidence in the state of windows vista that were going to all u s based small businesses and were offering free support one on one coaching and assistance via phone to help them go through and make the transition to windows vista
259468 we had an ambitious plan we made some significant investments around security in this product
259469 and you know what those investments they broke some things they broke a lot of things we know that
259470 but if you have a machine truly configured for vista you probably like vista my biggest problem is still the hardware footprint for vista
259471 i dont see that as being really adequate to the task
259472 but the base for all the systems in the catalog seems to be 1gb i still worry about the amount of ram in machines being sold with vista
259473 theres some compatibility problems but those are kind of being resolved
259474 thats not their fear their fear is spending that much money on hardware for a pc that can run vista
259475 as windows xp availability begins to wind down we want small businesses to know were behind them to provide special support during this transition period

259498 kommen wir zur zweiten versuchung jesu 5 da f hrte ihn der teufel mit sich in die heilige stadt und stellte ihn auf die zinne des tempels 6 und sprach zu ihm bist du gottes sohn so wirf dich hinab denn es steht geschrieben psalm 91 11 12 er wird seinen engeln deinetwegen befehl geben und sie werden dich auf den h nden tragen damit du deinen fu nicht an einen stein st t 7 da sprach jesus zu ihm wiederum steht auch geschrieben 5 mose 6 16 du sollst den herrn deinen gott nicht versuchen matth us 4 kapitel 5 7 deren exemplarische bedeutung in mancher hinsicht am schwersten zu verstehen ist
259499 zun chst ist da etwas auff lliges der teufel zitiert die heilige schrift um jesus in seine falle zu locken er zitiert den psalm 91 11f der von dem schutz spricht den gott dem gl ubigen menschen gew hrt denn er befiehlt seinen engeln dich zu h ten auf allen deinen wegen sie tragen dich auf ihren h nden damit dein fu nicht an einen stein st t
259500 der punkt um den es geht erscheint in der antwort jesu mt 4 7 die wiederum dem deuteronomium 5 buch mose 6 16 entnommen ist du sollst den herrn deinen gott nicht versuchen
259501 der gedanke dass gott sich die vergebung der schuld die heilung der menschen von innen her den tod seines sohnes hat kosten lassen ist uns heute sehr fremd geworden dass der herr unsere krankheit getragen und unsere schmerzen auf sich geladen
259502 dem verstehen des gro en geheimnisses der s hne steht dann aber auch unser individualistisches menschenbild im wege wir k nnen stellvertretung nicht mehr begreifen weil f r uns jeder mensch in sich allein eingehaust ist die tiefe verflochtenheit aller unserer existenzen und ihrer aller umgriffensein von der existenz des einen des menschgewordenen sohnes verm gen wir nicht mehr zu sehen wenn wir von der kreuzigung christi sprechen werden werden wir diese fragen aufgreifen m ssen einstweilen mag ein gedanke von kardinal john henry newman gen gen der einmal gesagt hat dass gott zwar die ganze welt mit einem wort aus dem nichts erschaffen konnte aber die schuld und das leiden der menschen die konnte er nur berwinden indem er sich selbst ins spiel brachte in seinem sohn selbst ein leidender wurde der diese last getragen und durch seine hingabe berwunden hat
259503 dass der autor dr joseph ratzinger die historische kritik abw rgt und sagt dass letztendlich die irrtumslosigkeit der bibel gilt und die inspiriertheit des gotteswortes
259504 dass es in der bibel kein unechtes wort jesu gebe das halte ich f r wissenschaftlich skandal s
259505 das buch jesus von nazareth dr joseph ratzinger april 2007 offenbart ganz bedenkliche tendenzen weil es die theologie als wissenschaft disqualifiziert darauf l uft es letztendlich hinaus
259506 nicht der sohn sondern allein der vater geh rt in das evangelium wie es jesus verk ndigt hat hinein
259507 insgesamt jedoch bedeutet das p pstliche jesusbuch eine r ckkehr zu einem jesusverst ndnis das hinter die aufkl rung zur ckf hrt
259508 vor allem die evangelikalen opponierten heftig gegen das was ihnen die theologie professoren mit wie mir schien heimlicher lust an der provokation vorsetzten und etliche studenten gefielen sich sehr in ihrer rolle als aufkl rer gerierten sich wie kleine voltaires http de wikipedia org wiki voltaire und zogen ein vierteljahr tausend nach voltaire viel lustgewinn aus ihrem bestreben die evangelikalen als bemitleidenswerte hinterw ldler vorzuf hren ich selbst sa meistens eher still dabei litt ein wenig mit den evangelikalen konnte sie gut verstehen aber nicht verteidigen jahrelang hatten sie in ihren christlichen jugendgruppen engagiert gearbeitet waren sie in ihren gemeinden meistens die einzigen die noch was auf die beine gestellt kriegten hatten sie f r ihr leben viel kraft aus den w rtlich geglaubten geschichten der bibel gezogen ihnen denen es wirklich ernst war mit ihrem glauben wurde nun dieser glaube ausgerechnet von der geistigen elite der kirche zertr mmert das musste ihnen teuflisch vorkommen der theologieprofessor als antichrist
259509 daran sollt ihr den geist gottes erkennen ein jeder geist der bekennt dass jesus christus in das fleisch gekommen ist der ist von gott und ein jeder geist der jesus nicht bekennt der ist nicht von gott und das ist der geist des antichrists von dem ihr geh rt habt dass er kommen werde und er ist jetzt schon in der welt
259510 wenn aber dieses anf ngt zu geschehen dann seht auf und erhebt eure h upter weil sich eure erl sung naht

259512 my question is in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead
259513 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country

259738 where did you come from is cardiff just made up of handsome stalker men
259739 we ran into each other outside and that is a problem we have to figure out why she is here and who brought her here gwen
259740 gwen id like you to get martha jones on the line and see what answers unit can give us about donna see if anything strange has come up in their reports something she might not notice ianto check the rift reports and see if there is anything out of the ordinary in fact see if there is anything out of the ordinary anywhere and donna i want you to have a seat and tell me everything that brings you here and also how on earth have you been
259741 umm thanks why is it an honor to meet me
259742 okay so youve got some sort of secret organization thing going on here that much i can tell but why did you bring me here what do you want from me
259743 i want you to tell me what youre doing here you obviously dont remember me ill try not to be insulted but you did remember my name now i could just be paranoid but i have a sneaking suspicion that someone or something has brought you here to cardiff and that cant be good
259744 look im just here for a training program at my work you must have me confused with someone else someone who who has a lot more exciting life
259745 but you werent here to observe the dinosaur life of cardiff what brought you here
259746 but why dont you answer a few questions for me handsome where are we why do you care so much about the fact that im in cardiff and who exactly are you
259747 okay im only going to explain this once and im not even sure i should tell you anything
259748 you were the most important woman in the entire universe once you traveled though time and space with a man named the doctor and you sacrificed part of yourself in order to stop a race of very evil beings from destroying all of reality
259749 the doctor had to erase all memory of himself from your mind because it would have killed you
259750 well in our timeline it was a few months ago when the earth was stolen
259751 this is a lot to handle and i can see you need some time to think can i get you anything coffee tea sedative
259752 im not finding much jack the company she works for is legitimate the training program shes going to is legitimate the unit agents assigned to her case said that nothing is out of the ordinary with her at all shes settled back into life alright and no one except us know how special she is i think we may have to accept that this was a complete accident
259753 you figured all of that out in such a short amount of time
259754 well ive been somewhat fascinated by her and ive been keeping an eye on her case
259755 has anyone ever told you that you make office work look so hot
259756 i know i know i am worried about her whole situation but if youre telling me that its all a simple coincidence than i guess theres no crunch for time on figuring this thing out
259757 and if im wrong and its not all a coincidence
259758 well then i need a little something to make my mind relax after all this is a little hard to accept she isnt supposed to remember me at all but when we were outside she said my name she remembered me even if she didnt realize it how could that happen
259759 oh come on dont sell yourself short youre one hard man to forget
259760 it really doesnt take you long to get turned on does it
259761 no its my own fault ive been getting lost in my head more and more lately
259762 i know it must be hard to comprehend i mean it isnt everyday that you find out you helped kill a whole race of aliens
259763 i did what there were aliens involved i killed aliens
259764 you werent the one who actually killed them if that makes you feel any better
259765 you know it doesnt matter im not even sure i believe any of it anyway i mean who ever heard a temp saving the world
259766 donna you saved the universe i know about you and i know that you only think of yourself as some insignificant temp
259767 those 51st century pheromones can be a bit contagious when im in the heat of the moment shall we say gwen should have built up an immunity by now but donna was susceptible incredibly susceptible
259768 it turns out that it actually was a complete coincidence that you came to cardiff
259769 so let me get this straight you folks brought me in here for no other reason than to tell me that its a coincidence that i came to cardiff dont get me wrong its been fun it really has
259770 but if thats the only thing you have to tell me i think i had better get going im sure you folks have a lot of interspacial mumbo jumbo to work although from the looks of things
259771 its a wonder you get any work done at all
259772 donna before you can leave i think i should talk to you
259773 you see ive told you what you werent meant to remember and im afraid that i may have opened the floodgates for you to remember more i mean you remembered my name without any prompt at all
259774 well ive had this information for a while now and my head hasnt exploded
259775 to be fair you have been a bit preoccupied for most of the time
259776 so what are you going to have to kill me or something
259777 we are not going to kill you we arent that kind of organization besides you are the infamous donna noble i couldnt hurt you even if i wanted to
259778 the infamous donna noble huh saved the world and all that
259779 hey anyone can save the world you saved the entirety of reality
259780 you people keep saying that but i cant remember any of it and trying to think about it hurts my head
259781 thats the thing your head hurts you now just trying to think about remembering imagine the pain your going to feel if you actually start remembering
259782 itll wipe your memory for the past twenty four hours
259783 dont you have any that wont last that long i havent even been in cardiff more than a few hours
259784 well we had some that only erased a few hours but gwen kept walking in on ianto and i and well we ran out
259785 so let me get this straight i take that little pill and i just forget everything thats happened in the past twenty four hours
259786 you go to sleep and when you wake up its all gone
259787 and what should i do in the mean time its not exactly time for bed yet maybe id be able to tell if you lot had a few skylights or something
259788 the pill has a mild sedative in it so falling asleep isnt a problem
259789 what if i didnt want to go to sleep just yet
259790 im sure we could occupy you in some fashion but it may have to be a team effort do you think
259791 oh yes it would definitely have to be a team effort
259792 hey team assemble in my office for an important meeting
259793 she mentioned something about guilt and having to go home to have a lot of guilt sex with rhys
259794 i see she got the doctors sex drive as well as part of his personality
259795 did i mention its a real honor to meet you
259796 do you want me to walk you back to your hotel make sure everything is okay
259797 oh come over here and at least give me a goodbye kiss
259798 its not fair you know that i wont be able to remember this day or you two id like to say ill miss you but i wont i mean i would if i could but i wont oh you know what i mean okay enough of these foolish goodbyes beam me up scotty

259883 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate this campaign has never engaged in racially tinged attacks and the obama campaign conceded as much yesterday in a statement clarifying that barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue that the times made this allegation in a blog post rather than running it on the editorial page indicates that they either knew the charge was bogus or they didnt have the nerve to make their case in full view of the public but in their new role as bloggers the papers editors seem to have all the intelligence and reason of the average daily kos diarist sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons and dragons they also have about as much care for the facts the board has already been forced to append a correction

259905 i dont think ive missed a usc home football game since i was about 4 and ever since then all i ever wanted to do was play football
259906 my brother went through the same thing not being allowed to play in youth leagues
259907 i pretty much knew i was going to usc if they ever showed interest
259908 i did look at other schools such as oregon and notre dame but as soon as coach pete carroll called from usc i committed right on the spot
259909 he was an outstanding offensive lineman the best freshman ive ever had at that position
259910 he hadnt played youth football but im sure he had a lot of help from his brother and dad he learned very quickly during our practices and you could tell by the time he was a sophomore or junior he was going to be one of the most heavily recruited linemen in the nation
259911 oaks christian was a great school but i really wanted to be a three sport athlete and my chances of doing that at oaks christian werent as good
259912 i had a long talk with coach redell and my parents about it and finally we decided it would be best to go to agoura
259913 kevins brother played for us at agoura so i was crushed when he decided to attend oaks christian his freshman year
259914 after his freshman year his parents contacted agoura considering a transfer i was really excited because you could always use a five star recruit on your football team
259915 i was sorry to see him go but it was probably a better situation for him at agoura
259916 he still could have played three sports for us here but i think most of his friends were at agoura and hed just be more comfortable there
259917 id love to have him back however if wegher will let me have him
259918 it looks like we have a very good team and the guys are working hard to get back into the playoffs
259919 playing center is a little different because im used to being in a twopoint stance and at center you have to be in a three point stance
259920 but ill play anywhere coach wants me to play i just want to help the team win
259921 i mean nobody is ever going to get by him he makes me a completely different player
259922 when graf first came here we talked about how he would eventually be heavily recruited
259923 i preached to him to be here until he was done and dont think about the next step until youve finished the one that lies in front of you
259924 we have a lot of receivers back we lost three starters on the offensive front and we need to get better
259925 in high school you could have a bad game and it was not as big of a deal you got over it and played well the next week in college you have a bad day and you could get cut
259926 with a new coaching staff the best thing you can do is know more of the playbook
259927 they have talked to me about a possible starting role and i want to make sure i can contribute all over the field
259928 thats allowed him to start forming a chemistry and bonding with the receivers and allowed him to get more of a leadership role with the offensive linemen ive been very very pleased with his progress as well as his throwing
259929 ive spent a lot of hours with our secondary coach rocky seto watching game film of quarterbacks intentions
259930 we have a lot of running backs but he looked good in the spring
259931 he needs to find his timing and shine and make plays when his time does come
259932 his throws are right on the money it helps when the quarterback and receivers are on the same page
259933 he had surgery to put a pin in his foot the healing process is going as planned hopefully he will be at full speed early on in camp
259934 were definitely going to be counting on him a lot
259935 hes going to have a bigger on his back than hes had in past seasons with mazza being gone but we still expect a huge year
259936 he can be a first team wideout in our league and that game should give him the confidence he needs to do it
259937 if im worth my salt and the rest of the leaders on this team are worth their salt scott will be up for the heisman in two years that would be awesome and great for colorado football
259938 the coaches expect me to take the no 1 role in the backfield
259939 to me its also a role of leadership where before it was more about proving yourself as a younger player its a totally different approach when you lead by example
259940 our quarterbacks can see the whole field at all times
259941 i had to get used to it again after going two years in a different style of offense
259942 but summer has been really good for me weve had a lot of practices and ive done pretty well
259943 the coaches need to see that in a pressure situation i can make a smart play
259944 i have to give our team a chance rather than fumbling the ball or throwing a pick
259945 lewis 6 foot 4 frame causes him to have good matchups on the line with people that either arent as big or arent as quick as him
259946 the biggest factor for him is learning how to run routes i wouldnt call him the starter but he should see a lot of playing time
259947 im not confident of anything at this point you just have to be patient
259948 im not going to say we were going to win the series but im a big body and can contest shots maybe helped guard david west
259949 i feel like carlisle is going to give me a fair chance thats all i want it seemed like they really wanted me too
259950 we have an all star in dirk nowitzki kidd josh howard we still have a good core out there then you have brandon bass thats why i wanted to come back
259951 we have a verbal agreement with dallas on a one year contract
259952 we talked to a number of teams and there is more money out there but this is the best situation for gerald at this point in his career
259953 with head coach rick carlisle and mario elie they will be vital to geralds development
259954 we put out inquiries to all the major stadiums in the area i just wanted to find a place that could hold our season ticketholders and visitors for an all star game but nothing really has gone past that at this point
259955 it is a great honor on behalf of the dallas mavericks to represent my country in the 2008 olympic games
259956 i look forward to the challenge of winning a gold medal
259957 it is always an honor to make the all nba team
259958 and to be recognized along with so many talented players means a lot to me
259959 it may be delayed by a day but were still moving forward
259960 do i think we might the right deal you never know till you know but i know i would make the same deal again
259961 usually the regular season is overrated but still youve got to find ways to win big games down the stretch and over the last couple weeks of the regular season we just couldnt get it done
259962 were just going to see whats coming in which players if im going to be here nobody really knows at this stage its up to mark cuban and donnie nelson to make the right decisions for this franchise for this organization and then we move forward its always sad to close a chapter off with avery johnson like i said we went to the finals and probably should have won the finals that year we were up 2 0 but its always sad when you have to close a chapter to me personally i feel like its another wasted year im in my prime right now im almost 30 now so i feel like i wasted another great opportunity to win the title and bring it here to dallas but things didnt work out this year again so if im going to be here again next year im going to get ready this summer hopefully be a part of the olympics thats my goal this summer and then come back a better player a better person if im back and give it another try
259963 i love what im doing and i love the team and i just think right now im just focusing on coming out and trying to get this team ready to play as best as we can and then whatever happens tomorrow then well have to manage that part of it
259964 i think in terms of what i came from a blueprint of what i knew how an organization should be ran from top to bottom i knew what type of players should be drafted free agent signings how the coach should function
259965 this is a results driven business and we got the results that we wanted in terms of when we made it to the finals now once you make it to the finals one of two teams are going to win but this organization had never made it there before so that was a pretty good result not the ending result of making it there but that was a pretty good result and by the way that was a pretty good team that team and the team that we had the year before that made it to the semifinals when we lost to phoenix in the second round those two teams were really deep special teams so we got the result we wanted the next year when we won 67 games that team significantly significantly overachieved we paid the price for it in the playoffs and this years team it was a miracle we made the playoffs i just think it was time for somebody else to come in mark and donnie felt the same way and thats why were here today
259966 no not this year this is a different team before we made the trade we had the best record against the western conference and one of the things that i talked to mark and donnie about i said hey ive got to get a point guard thats why i wanted to develop devin harris i said ive got to get this boy to a point where he can be a scorer first and pass some we got him to a point like i told you guys before we were knocking on the door with this young man making the all star team he was going to be an 18 and 8 player i invested a significant amount of time with him and again he was injured and a lot of things were happening around the nba and like i said if we can just hold on a little while weve got the best record against the west i think we were second or third in the western conference at that point and we were going to play the western conference quite a bit after the all star break the team was changed and we never really got back on track
259967 heres the thing that trade that was made we dont want to bring devins name in it or jason kidd im not going to give you guys something on jason kidd or devin harris or mark or donnie
259968 im on record as what my feelings were and its over with now it was something that was tried and it didnt take us anywhere that was close we were struggling to make the playoffs so it didnt nearly bring us the rewards that we wanted but whos to say that even if it did if we had gotten to the second round or the third round that this particular move and my situation still wouldnt have been made
259969 i didnt say i was comfortable thats your words dont put words in my mouth im not necessarily cool about this but what am i supposed to do my life has to continue i feel proud about what weve done here contrary to popular belief we were a seventh seed this year that was anywhere from a seventh to a ninth seed could have been a 10th seed with this particular team we werent quick we just didnt have what it takes to compete against some of the teams in the western conference what it is is what it is i think last years team significantly overachieved i really feel proud of what we did with that team i didnt like us losing in the first round to golden state but we accomplished the sixth best record in league history and then what youre going to have to do four years from now like nellie wanted me to take this program to another level then four years from now youll sit around and the next guy that comes in youll see what theyve done compared to this tenure and the last tenure
259970 well just during the course of some games i wasnt getting that response
259971 yes and theres nothing wrong with that im proud of my working relationship with mark im proud of it weve had moments behind the scenes where weve talked about management styles vision and ive learned a whole heck of a lot from mark again this i dont have anything but great things to say there were 29 other owners in the nba and nobody else gave me my first shot but him did we have some rough periods absolutely am i proud that we were able to get through those rough periods yes i am for our friends in germany can you say what it was like coaching dirk just great a 7 foot man who can do what he can do on the floor he is the hardest working player that ive ever coached or worked with that ive seen put it like this hes the hardest working player ive been around in 20 years all right i was always concerned about fatigue with him especially in the latter part of the season but he embraced me as being coach i feel really great because during the time that i was here he was able tow in the mvp im proud of that when i go to sleep at night thats one of the things i can feel really proud of and when you win mvp its not only for the individual its for the team for the coaching staff for the city when i won coach of the year that wasnt my award that award was for our coaching staff and our owner and the players and our fans its not an individual award so i feel great about my time and my working relationship with dirk
259972 im going to be a little more patient just again i think i learned that the season is a long season and you cant get 200 things done in the first day of training camp and i learned that in my tenure here you learn some different game strategies again wed have to take three hours to talk about everything i feel i am going to be a better coach and because of that fortunately there will be some great opportunities out there from me
259973 more than anything hes great at being dirk he is a player thats very coachable hes a player thats an mvp perennial all star he leads in a different way than some of the guys that you mentioned but i think at the end of the day he needs some help any great player needs help you look at whats happening with the lakers kobe as great as kobe is theyve gotten in the position theyre in now because bynum got better i know he got injured now gasol is there post shaq so again i think any great player needs help in dirks situation he needs some young guys or maybe another veteran player thats still in the prime of their career that can really get out there and really give him they type of support he needs shelf life with cuban well no first off all we avery and nellie are in a little bit different situations because hopefully in my situation with mark a month from now or a year from now i dont want to have a public spat theres really no need for that now if somebody else wants to go engage in something like that i dont want to be a part of it so its a little bit different situation i just think mark has the opportunity now to really look at a lot of different candidates theyre going to have to have a clear understanding on exactly how things work and function when they get here
259974 well it was going to happen at some point whether it was five years down the line or yesterday i think if the facts if you really get all the facts if you look at what it takes ill give you a little basketball 101 on what it takes to win a championship if you really look at what it takes to win a championship look at all the champions they win championships because they have a superstar we have one here in dirk you got to have really strong strong play at the center position and you got to have in this day and age a speedy quick point guard or som ebody a guard that will dribble drive and get that ball to the free throw line and you have to have depth on the bench experience on your coaching staff and we feel that with what we had to work with if you compare rosters we have nothing to be ashamed of and thats what i was trying to say all the years if you look at what we had to work with we went to the finals with jason terry and jason terry did a heck of a job for me i dont know if im still coaching a year later or two years later had jason terry not did what he did in the playoffs for us w e feel proud overall of what we did with what we had to work with and thats why now leaving were not leaving with our heads down
259975 when youre drafting players when youre signing free agents or making trades whatever youre doing everybody i think has to be on the same page the coach has to always have the support even if you disagree behind the scenes of management i would say overall this with donnie mark and myself what weve done here we can feel proud of it and whatever differences whatever you know this guy wants this guy this guy wants to do this or do that i think whatever was done behind the scenes we were able to work it out and thats what its all about
259976 aw crap theyre all gone i think the squirrels must have got to them
