2970064 ive heard rumours the out patients clinic there will close again and then theres the talk of elective surgery being cancelled i dont think its right and someone has to do something about it its only going to get worse otherwise

2970097 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2970098 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2970223 adenoviruses are a diverse family of agents that replicate their dna genome in the cell nucleus we wanted to find out how the virus gets to the nucleus to replicate to do this we have been using live cell fluorescence microscopy which means we can literally watch the virus travelling inside the cell
2970224 virus dna is transported from the edge of the cell to the nucleus in the middle by attaching to microtubules these are microscopic tubes that form part of the cytoskeleton keeping the cell in shape and carrying molecules around in the cytoplasm
2970225 we found an unexpected new link between microtubule based transport in the cytoplasm of the cell and the import of virus dna to the nucleus

2970230 i cant see any reason why they wouldnt want to do it the more football the lad gets the better tom took his goal really well on saturday and he can play in a number of positions
2970231 i stated to the lads beforehand that i owed farsley one for spoiling my first day as a manager
2970232 we didnt play our best football and farsley werent the best team in the world we werent much better in the first half but the one thing youll get from my team is commitment
2970233 it was just a good team performance the whole lot working for each other

2970239 this was a very good game tonight we made a few mistakes here and there but i am happy with the way my team played overall we are going to enjoy this moment
2970240 i believe that all of my players played well tonight and as a unit they were solid
2970241 we needed to win tonight we didnt have a choice about this so we needed to score goals we talked about it at the half and i told them they should be more relaxed
2970242 the whole team played well but they list concentration at a point and vanzekin has to be a bit careful he should not be in a too much of a hurry that is what caused the goal for japan
2970243 there are areas where they should play one touch and other areas where they should carry the ball and they have to know the right time to do this
2970244 i dont know why siasia replaced osaze he was doing well and with his experience he should be the pivot of the team and do more of the job in the midfield
2970245 ekpo used to play for me here at akwa united and i know what his ability siasia should bring him on early enough he is skillful strong and a good passer of the ball

2970248 newness is in the mind of the artist who creates and not in the object he portrays what moves men of genius or rather what inspires their work is not new ideas but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough
2970249 i wont look at what has come before i wont go to galleries or museums i wont read or talk to artists and thus i cant help but be original
2970250 sometimes it is best to say something new with an old technique because ninety nine people out of a hundred see only technique glackens had the courage to use renoirs version of the rubens titian technique and he found something new to say with it cezanne may have tried to paint like el greco but he couldnt help making c zannes he never had to worry about whether he was being original dont be afraid to borrow the great men the most original borrowed from everybody witness shakespeare and rembrandt they borrowed from the technique of tradition and created new images by the power of their imagination and human understanding little men just borrow from one person assimilate all you can from tradition and then say things in your own way there are as many ways of drawing as there are ways of thinking and thoughts to think

2970289 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2970290 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2970291 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2970292 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2970293 ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid nothing has been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow i participated in the payment of money that is a lie an absolute lie which is typical of these types of publications
2970294 published in a supermarket tabloid that is absolutely not true

2970304 technological innovation is driving the proliferation of online video and we have introduced the most advanced video platform in the industry
2970305 but while web video has been growing at a geometric rate existing platforms havent kept pace we offer a more intelligent approach to managing and publishing video because of our systems ability to look inside the video itself delve allows users to navigate to the content they want to see inside a program bringing the power of search and the ease of dvr style navigation to online video
2970306 delves platform allows users to find the topics they want inside the high quality video that we produce
2970307 we find that the heatmap technology is particularly compelling as it saves users time and gives them an instant visual map of a video file this kind of innovation is raising the bar for video publishing on the web
2970308 we were attracted to delves video platform because its the most advanced end to end solution for publishing video on the web today
2970309 we especially like the way that delve enables users to navigate inside our video programming this is the kind of game changing technology that video publishers are looking for

2970314 life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death
2970315 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
2970316 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
2970317 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
2970318 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
2970319 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

2970322 jason swam one of the fastest relays of all time his last 50 meters were absolutely incredible
2970323 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
2970324 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2970325 i had more adrenaline going than ive ever had in my life
2970326 its an unreal feeling because ive been part of the last two olympic relays that we came in silver and bronze in 2000 and 2004 and america has a great tradition of winning that relay we were the favorites both of those years and this year we were actually considered the underdog i still cant believe we all did as well as we did
2970327 then i changed and said its ridiculous this is the olympics
2970328 i got like super charged and took it from there
2970329 i jumped into the air and almost fell into the pool
2970330 i was really nervous that maybe i had messed up and didnt swim fast enough but jason said it best that we were one unit
2970331 there was a little bit of disappointment because it was so close
2970332 but i got a bronze medal yesterday and a silver today if i keep climbing up like this im going to be happy
2970333 obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of hurt my confidence at little bit
2970334 i felt good going into this race everybody brought their a game and swam really well its a true testament to how well beijing has done with its pool to allow the athletes to perform at their peak
2970335 i wasnt doing it for the crowd i was doing it for me im the one who has to live with it whether people thought i was an idiot or a hero i wanted to finish the race

2970358 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
2970359 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
2970360 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
2970361 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
2970362 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
2970363 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
2970364 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
2970365 we could add some core messaging functionality to firefox or take just a piece of snowl to put in the browser or maybe do it some other way as a more mature extension separate from firefox
2970366 i think this is a project that will run more than just months
2970367 its hard to believe that within three to six months we would add messaging to firefox this is a rough estimate but i think its a one to two year thing

2970372 he told me recently in hockenheim that he wished to race again because he loves the town and the relaxed atmosphere he found here
2970373 almost everything was set for kubica to attend the race in 2007 but at the last minute a commitment prevented him from coming
2970374 he watched the international challenge on tv and knows what the race is about

2970391 if the great epics j and e really had formed the basis of the pentateuch how is it that the authors of israels earlier literature had virtually no knowledge of them the fact that the authors of the pre exilic literature of the old testament outside the pentateuch appear to know virtually nothing of the patriarchal and mosaic traditions of the pentateuch raises serious doubts about the existence of an early j or e
2970392 presumably this means that any non yahweh traditions were either dropped or rewritten of yahweh

2970426 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2970427 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2970428 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2970429 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2970430 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2970431 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2970432 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2970433 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2970447 at minimum ce interconnection standards should rely on a low cost widely adopted and universally implementable interface ethernet over rj45 being the obvious choice
2970448 the commission should urge ce manufacturers even as they implement the mou to take steps now to future proof their devices and ensure compatibility with video providers
2970449 this is essentially in order to ensure that the technological shift towards ip does not end before it reaches the television set
2970450 to make mandatory the availability of set top boxes using an ip based interface that facilitates home networking such as ethernet
2970451 we would like to believe in video platforms or internet protocols but we havent seen proof that they exist yet

2970453 mit dem bau der neuen rennstrecke in indien habe ich selbst nicht viel zu tun
2970454 nachdem was ich bislang dar ber geh rt habe l uft aber alles nach plan und indien sollte 2010 seinen eigenen grand prix haben
2970455 nat rlich hat auch die vorstellung von force india als eines von nur zehn teams in der startaufstellung das interesse an der formel 1 in indien dramatisch erh ht und die popularit t steigt immer weiter
2970456 ich hoffe sehr dass wir 2009 eine weitaus bessere performance an den tag legen k nnen was die aufmerksamkeit der fans noch weiter anheizen k nnte wenn die formel 1 dann schlie lich 2010 nach indien kommt dann wird das eine wunderbare geschichte

2970463 wir versuchen unsere pace noch etwas zu steigern wir sind die saison ein bisschen zur ckhaltend angegangen jetzt wollen wir schneller werden
2970464 aber das wichtigste ist dass ich die rallyes beende wir wollen bei so vielen rallye wie m glich das ziel sehen wenn ich mich dabei gut f hle versuche ich auch schneller zu fahren
2970465 vielleicht sogar die top 8 aber das ist wohl ein bisschen viel verlangt top 10 zielank nfte und gute zeiten das sind meine ziele

2970482 my hamstring is 100 percent now it took about four weeks for it to get fully recovered
2970483 ive basically been getting rehab on it and doing some light training in the process
2970484 id rather be a 100 percent coming into the olympics than risk being 85 percent going to a meet just to see where im at
2970485 i had a few chances in practice to see where im at and that kind of gave me a confidence booster

2970498 now that were aware of global warming we should not do anything to exacerbate it
2970499 for any of these manufacturing processes there is also a safer alternative and that includes climate safety
2970500 nf3 triggers the radar that there may be other surprises coming in global warming
2970501 we must be vigilant about new industrial gases that contribute
2970502 traditional revenue sources will not be sufficient to fund games development if you look at the very narrow definition of the gaming market people are saying the software business will be down 20 per cent by 2011 versus this year
2970503 something is going to have to be there to make up the difference and take us beyond that threshold
2970504 my guess and analysis shows that less than 3 out of 10 games recover their development and marketing costs with boxed goods sales
2970505 so whats going to have to happen creative use of hybrid online and offline advertising revenues online offline transactions with consumers these business models must be explored
2970506 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended

2970511 i dont want them using my image and then say get out of iraq but continue to fund it
2970512 any candidate whos going to bring true progressive values to the political system
2970513 is going to be stabbed in the back by the democratic party
2970514 the democrats right now are using global warming as a cover to try to work nuclear power into the energy plan
2970515 theyre selling out to the nuclear power industry and all the people who are going to make money off of this

2970519 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2970520 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community or to try to get away from those folks
2970521 john edwards is an extraordinary human being who made an egregious error
2970522 i feel sad because i know john edwards so well in life we all make mistakes it breaks my heart if this is going to disqualify him from being a public servant because he would be a great one
2970523 i think it has gone tremendously and i praise god for it
2970524 i think it is because the hand of the lord is in it

2970542 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
2970543 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2970544 i had more adrenaline going than ive ever had in my life
2970545 its an unreal feeling because ive been part of the last two olympic relays that we came in silver and bronze in 2000 and 2004 and america has a great tradition of winning that relay we were the favorites both of those years and this year we were actually considered the underdog i still cant believe we all did as well as we did
2970546 then i changed and said its ridiculous this is the olympics
2970547 i got like super charged and took it from there
2970548 i jumped into the air and almost fell into the pool
2970549 i was really nervous that maybe i had messed up and didnt swim fast enough but jason said it best that we were one unit
2970550 there was a little bit of disappointment because it was so close
2970551 but i got a bronze medal yesterday and a silver today if i keep climbing up like this im going to be happy
2970552 obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of hurt my confidence at little bit
2970553 i felt good going into this race everybody brought their a game and swam really well its a true testament to how well beijing has done with its pool to allow the athletes to perform at their peak
2970554 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2970555 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2970556 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2970557 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2970558 you told me more about the process than i know

2970561 a bsent some indicia of fraud or other circumstance warranting equitable intervention it is the duty of a court to enforce rather than reform the bargain struck
2970562 that article iii controls would compel us to view that article in a vacuum dismissing the significance if not the actual presence of article vi and thereby ignoring the need to read the agreement as a whole
2970563 we have a form that police officers are supposed to fill out every time there is a crash

2970571 they have challenged him to put the firearm down and hes turned and raised the firearm and shot himself
2970572 weve been working on our shape in training and i think that showed in the match
2970573 i think we can take a lot out of the game and bring it into the chelsea match next week
2970574 united are a really good side the european champions so to get a clean sheet against them is great
2970575 okay we lost on penalties but we play them in the league in a couple of weeks and thats when it really counts
2970576 it was difficult against ferdinand and vidic it always is whenever united lose the ball they get back to shape really quickly and get a lot of bodies all around you
2970577 i think the england manager was here and he knows what we can do
2970578 its up to him if were selected but weve got a good record together and if were picked then im sure well be ready

2970583 the consequences of years of agitation by the people of the south south now seeking redress of the historic injustice done to them by the federal system particularly the military regimes has been colossal it has led to the militarization of our children and the almost total loss of a generation of our youths this in my view is one of the greatest challenges that needs the attention of our legislators
2970584 the south south region in my humble view faces the challenge of environmental degradation unfair allocation of resources and more fundamentally lack of control and ownership of land and the resources therein this had led to the prolonged agitation which in nigerian political parlance is known as the niger delta crisis the deprivation of ownership and control over communal lands and resources has resulted in historical injustice to the people of the region

2970590 blinded to potential international precedents policy makers in the u s almost instinctively look to previous experience in the urban gay communities in the 1980s when thinking about community mobilization to fight aids even though tis unique history of gay aids activism has only limited relevance to the challenge confronting black america

2970608 our people are already working on getting the appropriate permits from police and local authorities around the world
2970609 the candle for tibet initiative is a most wonderful thing fitting in with the tibetan tradition of lighting votive lamps in long rows in temples and in special butter lamp houses outside we seem powerless to ameliorate conditions on the ground in tibet in the present crisis moment this peaceful prayer vigil since it focuses the minds of many millions on the different sufferings of tormented and tormentor alike is a powerful way to intervene and it does not preclude anything else we can think of and do further on i hope everyone who reads this will join in this important effort

2970661 a notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft
2970662 it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases
2970663 we dont want a situation where all unauthorised access of information will result in a requirement to notify
2970664 instead in our view where the breach can cause a serious harm to an individual is when there should be disclosure serious harm might be information such as a tax file number which can result in identity theft
2970665 we have moved the bar up so that were not looking at trivial breaches
2970666 these days information privacy touches almost every aspect of our daily lives including our medical records and health status our finances and creditworthiness the personal details collected and stored on a multiplicity of public and corporate databases and even the ability to control the display and distribution of our own images

2970697 we are not surprised in the decision given the reams of scientific economic and industry data put before the epa and the strong support from the u s department of agriculture
2970698 ethanol in conjunction with other alternative energy sources such as biodiesel wind and solar power is part of the solution to a growing energy crisis in america

2970724 this forest is for wwf one of the most important places on earth it is at the cutting edge of conservation for this organisation
2970725 this is a place with stunning resources the only place where you can see lowland gorillas and forest elephants but more broadly a real spectacular forest from a biodiversity perspective
2970726 working at the highest levels with heads of states and foreign partners and at the same time working with local communities to try and find solutions which can sustain conservation in the long term so it is a flagship programme for our organisation
2970727 it is not something i see every day it is a wonderful landscape the gorillas are so special i have not seen gorillas for quite sometime so that was very special
2970728 i think there is a deep understanding within this organisation that conservation can only be successful if it works for people in particular who live in the areas we are trying to protect that we are broadly working for society we have recognised that for a very long time and the strategy that you now see developing in the congo basin for the amazon for the coral triangle and so on are focused on finding lasting solutions and lasting solutions means solutions that work for the people
2970729 the difference i see here is in the effort to integrate the local communities into the solution and also to enable sustainable economic activities to be carried out
2970730 that is the real future for a lot of protected areas
2970731 you cannot expect people to change their behaviours when they are not able to feed or send their children to school or have a better life i am very gratified to see how integrated the community leaders are in this project
2970732 is a ground breaking programme working with communities and working on the environment where the needs of the communities are so pre eminent
2970733 the meetings i had 18 months ago in yaounde obviously indicate to me that there is a real promise here you see some particular governments very serious about conservation and about really taking a leadership role in deciding how forest management can be done one of our tasks is to make sure that we are supporting those who want to do things the right way those who want to really find good solutions and to help make sure that they are successful we should not miss that opportunity here in cameroon
2970734 i think everyone recognises that this programme has been very successful in all aspects on developing skills within the communities on promoting cooperation amongst countries on protecting the environment and raising awareness
2970735 i love my husband but i also love my mate
2970736 we have been living for years now and i see no reason why i should start objecting to the marriage arrangement

2970739 the house that non deductible debt that is the killer
2970740 if you can get rid of the mortgage in 10 15 years then you can focus your entire finances on the rest of the stuff which is usually saving for retirement
2970741 the biggest thing that hinders the accumulation because debt takes so much money away into the wrong areas especially if the debt is not deductible like the house mortgage or the credit card
2970742 theres some big saving to be had by paying off a mortgage and its risk free you control how fast it goes down you control when you pay it off theres no additional risk because it is your mortgage you have already
2970743 its boring theres no excitement whatsoever to paying off debt but it works like a charm
2970744 one of the approaches weve had in the past is make your rrsp contribution but then use the tax refund that you receive and use that to pay down your mortgage more aggressively
2970745 what is going to be coming beginning 09 is the tax free savings account and that is something that will have a particular attraction to many people simply because of its flexibility and non taxability

2970777 weve decided against releasing a 2009 version of money plus boxed product
2970778 microsoft money plus distribution efforts will focus on selling software online via download and we have discontinued traditional box sales of the software at retail i doubt this surprises many of you especially those whove discussed with me how annual releases dont make much sense for a product thats in its 17th version
2970779 broadband clearly is mainstream more and more people are shopping for software online particularly in the financial arena
2970780 this distribution model means less packaging which obviously is better for the environment clearly it makes sense for the marketplace todays consumers want instant gratification and last years sales percentages show that the immediacy of the download appeals to a large number of customers
2970781 online distribution means retailers can provide more inventory of our products but require less physical space to manage inventory
2970782 one of the reasons were excited about this is the real time alert capability
2970783 the system makes the analysis in milliseconds and the brokerage can take immediate action getting a few minutes lead time can make all the difference

2970812 i cannot conclude this judgment without showing my alarm at the callousness and dishonesty of all the other shareholders except asemota who showed himself to be a man of honour here was a stranger in our land who used his brains and expertise to establish a port complex when the going was rough chief idugboe fell out with the others and took them to court as the literature author put it things fell apart idugboe was no longer at ease it was the respondent that championed the cause of the company he stood firm for he believed in what he created the government stepped in acquired the complex over eight million naira rolled in and the sight of money brought the combatants together meanwhile the respondent was in australia it was easy for these other shareholders to exclude him from the booty they have benefited from his brain but he was not good enough to participate in the sharing of the windfall to say the least it is turpid and it stinks

2970828 developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching
2970829 by putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing you can then relay that information in real time to a coach and they can see for example what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique
2970830 its for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see

2970833 we are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body
2970834 the aerodynamics particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort thats expended
2970835 but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade off you are going to accept
2970836 it is very adjustable to different people but it also much better mimics the track cycling event
2970837 i dont know what your destiny will be but one thing i do know the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve
2970838 we are very pleased to be able to offer additional benefits to attendees of this years event
2970839 its clear attendees want more detailed information on how to deploy epc systems and more personalized advice we are doing everything we can to meet those needs
2970840 the education we are providing with epcglobal at the event and the guide to meeting sams clubs rfid epc tagging requirements will dramatically cut the time it takes to comply with retail tagging rquirement even at the sellable unit level
2970841 weve gained a lot of experience since wal mart first ask suppliers to use epc tags and now weve distilled that into practical education for those now looking to become compliant
2970842 in february we won an average of about one new sams club supplier customer every day
2970843 after completing this course you will see how easy it is to meet these requirements
2970844 as director of client services at epcsolutions and as a former training executive i am passionate about listening to our customers and developing solutions that meet and exceed their expectations
2970845 this information will allow any supplier to understand what sams club is asking for and develop a plan that will eliminate their risk reduce their cost and shorten the time it takes to become compliant

2970898 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
2970899 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
2970900 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
2970901 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here
2970902 you do this you do that this reading is over
2970903 reincarnationists do not seem to want to consider the logical explanations for their experiences which are sometimes as little as feeling drawn to a place etc does anyone really consider this their proof of a past life
2970904 if things were so great up there then why are we so screwed up as people down here
2970905 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
2970906 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
2970907 you probably have no idea what you are talking about
2970908 spirits are giving you impressions of their past its not you remembering
2970909 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
2970910 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
2970911 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
2970912 but the survival of personal identity adequately supported by facts contradicts the main doctrine of the reincarnationist

2970914 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well

2970940 the personality of the candidate the way he is projected by the advirtising experts are the things that really matter
2970941 the danger in a democracy is this it depends on the individual voter making an inteligent and rational choice what these people are doing is try to bypass the rational side and appeal to his deep unconscious forces below the surface so that you are in a way making nonsense of the whole democratic procedure

2970960 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2970961 we really should be insisting they should wear their team gear i think that might be a small precaution i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in olympic gear
2970962 we ask our athletes when they are in official venues or canada olympic house to wear their hbc clothing and that is the only clothing edict we have

2970990 bei ihrem beschluss ein teil des kodori gebirges von den georgischen formationen zu befreien war abchasiens f hrung so denke ich gerade von der notwendigkeit ausgegangen das in abchasien zu verhindern was in s dossetien geschehen ist
2970991 insofern wird es dort zweifellos ein anderes szenario geben die abchasische seite wird von ihrer vorstellung von der aggressivit t von herrn saakaschwili und dessen gefolgschaft ausgehen
2970992 morgen wenn der georgische au enminister nach br ssel kommt und sich der nato rat eventuell trifft wird russland die einberufung einer au erordentlichen sitzung des russland nato rats fordern um seine argumente darzulegen und die wahrheit ber die mittel zu sagen die das regime von saakaschwili anwendet sowie ber die schritte die unsere friedenskr fte unternehmen
2970993 ich m chte nicht glauben dass hinter den handlungen saakaschwilis und hinter jenen formen der barbarei die dieser mann in seinem handeln gegen ber der zivilbev lkerung gew hlt hat einflussreiche menschen stecken ich denke wenn sie von der operation als sie vorbereitet wurde auch wussten so doch nicht detailliert

2970998 wie der konflikt zu l sen ist im moment wohl gar nicht m sste man aus heutiger sicht sagen wenn man denn ehrlich ist sp ter vielleicht dadurch dass die s dosseten nach russland bersiedeln was nat rlich den bitteren beigeschmack einer deportation h tte und an stalins vertreibungen w hrend der vierziger jahre erinnern w rde die abchasen aber brauchen eine weitgehende autonomie

2971040 fourteen hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
2971041 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
2971042 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
2971043 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
2971044 the movement needs to enter the public eye and not just be talking among ourselves
2971045 they have approached the man who was armed with the firearm she said
2971046 they have challenged him to put the firearm down and hes turned and raised the firearm and shot himself
2971047 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by enemies stop it thats it
2971048 zimbabwe is not for sale and zimbabwe will never be a colony again

2971053 the suspects are part of a group of militiamen who had sought refuge in uganda they were trying to sneak back when they were intercepted near the border
2971054 some of them were shot dead on saturday afternoon but their colleagues hid in the forest officers caught up with them later and they were killed
2971055 those arrested had surrendered they did not confront the army when they were challenged to surrender they are being interrogated at an army base
2971056 we have been at the forefront of the climate change issue for years a large percentage of our electricity already comes from renewable energy sources and we are in the tropics we dont have problems heating up our homes and buildings during the winter
2971057 the first thing is measuring what the emissions actually are then were looking at ways that we can do our agricultural practices better to reduce the emissions in addition to production we are also involved in transportation so we are also looking at ways of being more fuel efficient
2971058 you can see the growth here in the tropics its incredible in four months they can grow 50 to 60cm
2971059 the tree starts absorbing carbon dioxide from when its a seedling especially during the first 10 to 15 years its a very efficient way of absorbing carbon from the atmosphere
2971060 costa rica has been the only country in central america ahead of everyone else in terms of protecting the environment
2971061 i believe this is the first step to mitigate even more the impact they have on climate change the only thing i see is a little bit problematic is by 2021 its a huge target
2971062 the real challenge for costa rica is transportation most of our emissions come from this sector we really have to start making changes in how costa ricans are moving but as the economy grows if more people want to have their own cars we have to take that in to account
2971063 we are in the right position in this country to be the crucible for the changes that the rest of the world is looking for we cannot let it fail we need to get everyone on our side to make this small experiment in something very radical but very necessary to work
2971064 weve decided against releasing a 2009 version of money plus boxed product
2971065 microsoft money plus distribution efforts will focus on selling software online via download and we have discontinued traditional box sales of the software at retail i doubt this surprises many of you especially those whove discussed with me how annual releases dont make much sense for a product thats in its 17th version the time seems right for this shift last years sales of the software via download outpaced in store sales for the first time in fact software downloads accounted for more than 50 percent of microsoft money sales
2971066 this move means more business efficiencies on all fronts broadband clearly is mainstream more and more people are shopping for software online particularly in the financial arena
2971067 todays consumers want instant gratification and last years sales percentages show that the immediacy of the download appeals to a large number of customers in addition retailers and other partners have asked for more opportunities to work with us on new distribution initiatives many are excited about the additional flexibility this change offers them online distribution means they can provide more inventory of our products but require less physical space to manage inventory
2971068 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2971069 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2971070 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2971071 why even entertain using dre when clearly the government may not afford it a few years from now
2971072 lets face it dre and omr will not make the results transparent to the public
2971073 hes been very vocal about it but we dont know the details yet the council is open to consider the web based technology
2971074 the bottom line is we were not able to return families in areas where they milf supposedly have withdrawn it is impossible to return residents to their homes and the number of affected families even increased
2971075 we are conducting air strikes close air support for our ground forces they are inching towards the different barangay villages
2971076 umbra kato is a legitimate commander of the milf who heads the 105th base command it is not correct to say that they are not following orders
2971077 law enforcement operations will not cease until the five towns are cleared
2971078 we believe that there will be no escalation the breaking of the law is isolated limited to one base command the rest of the milf respect authority and conscious of peace process
2971079 but the military has information that there are also heavy casualties on their milf side
2971080 an official report of casualties and damage incurred by the enemies
2971081 they milf are resisting heavily they would like to make it firm that they should be in those lands
2971082 we have sufficient stocks of basic necessities for the evacuees
2971083 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2971084 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2971085 the philippines and switzerland share a strong commitment to peace freedom and democracy
2971086 expressed satisfaction over the past close and successful cooperation on the restitution of the marcos assets from switzerland to the philippines following the final ruling by the swiss federal court in 1998
2971087 president couchepin conveyed the firm expectation of the swiss government that the philippine congress may soon enact the human rights compensation bill president couchepin also assured president arroyo of the continuing support for philippine authorities in recovering marcos assets in switzerland and in third countries
2971088 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2971089 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2971090 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2971091 my lad in charge of second rate spectacles musically leading a loud noise 5 4
2971092 you know what i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2971093 but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2971094 yeah he wants to come back im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2971095 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with andrews
2971096 hes got some guys here that really care about him

2971101 tax incentives would make it much more attractive for film companies to shoot in the highlands and islands
2971102 i have been involved in a few scottish productions shot in other countries because it was cheaper when i wish they could have been shot here
2971103 i would love to film again in moray i am trying to find scripts to shoot here maybe a new film of macbeth
2971104 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
2971105 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
2971106 they can be very dangerous animals if you dont know what youre doing
2971107 its very unlikely a person on a massage table is going to kick me
2971108 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2971109 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2971110 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2971111 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2971112 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2971113 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2971114 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2971115 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2971116 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2971117 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2971118 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2971119 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2971120 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2971121 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2971122 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2971123 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2971124 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2971125 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2971126 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2971127 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2971128 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2971129 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2971130 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2971131 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2971132 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2971133 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2971134 det at tro p jesus er bare det helt rigtige nu tror vi s dan rigtigt

2971139 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2971140 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2971141 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2971142 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2971143 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2971144 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2971145 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2971146 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2971147 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2971148 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2971149 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2971150 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2971151 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2971152 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2971153 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2971154 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2971155 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2971156 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2971157 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2971158 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2971159 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2971160 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2971161 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2971162 o presidente saakashvili aceitou praticamente todas as propostas que fizemos
2971163 avi es russos est o bombardeando perto do local do presidente
2971164 estamos tentando acabar com isso o mais r pido poss vel
2971165 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2971166 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2971167 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2971168 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2971169 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2971170 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2971171 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2971172 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2971173 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2971174 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2971175 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2971176 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2971177 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2971178 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2971179 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2971180 the goal came as no surprise to me i have been practicing this at training before i received the cross from katza i looked at pirates goalkeeper and saw that he had left space at the right post and decided to hit it in that direction with a first time shot
2971181 i am proud of the fact that i managed to score a goal in my first official game for supersport and i hope that there are many more to come
2971182 i am happy with my level of fitness as the only real action i have had since leaving jomo cosmos is playing for liberia during the world cup and african nations cup qualifying games
2971183 it was great to put on that jersey of the national team at a time when i had already begun to think i would never get a call up to the senior team
2971184 it is unbelievable that all of a sudden my fortunes have changed so much i am enjoying my football at my club which managed to get to the play offs we were just so unlucky to let bay united off the hook right at the end otherwise we could have been playing in the psl this year
2971185 i think credit should go to the coach serame letsoaka he is so well organised tactically and technically serame is genuinely a good coach as he relates well to players and is always willing to listen as much he is to talk
2971186 i signed a two year contract when i arrived and still have a year remaining which i will honour it is up to the club to decide if a psl team approaches them for my services before the close of the transfer window but i am happy here in johannesburg because my family is also here with me
2971187 it sounds so unbelievable that sir alex should make such alarming statements i think this is just media speculation but sir alex is in a position to make further clarifications if it is not done we would then know what to do and the appropriate steps to take
2971188 we do not take such statements lightly if he sir alex believed rooney contacted a virus in nigeria we had expected him to communicate this to us formally but he has not done that and we feel this may just be hearsay
2971189 however we are compelled to demand clarifications from sir alex because he was quoted by media reports maybe he only used the nigeria tour to capture his sojourn in africa during the pre season where he first went to south africa and spent a week at the vodacom challenge before coming to nigeria to spend less than 24 hours
2971190 united arrived abuja at about 2 00am from south africa had a light work out before sir alex david gill and fletcher came out to address the media at a noon parley that did not last more than an hour
2971191 later they went to the stadium played the match against portsmouth and from the stadium they left straight back to england
2971192 the only public function that manchester united attended in nigeria was the press briefing because they did not meet with the organizers they did not meet with the sponsors or children and neither did they meet with the numerous man united fans
2971193 i would have been happier with a win but even in this loss i am at least impressed that we are not behind the netherlands
2971194 but then you cannot expect much when you dont get regular games to play
2971195 our players were in no doubt a bit rusty but that didnt stop them from giving their best we are a grateful to the netherlands for availing themselves and coming all the way here to play this game
2971196 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
2971197 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
2971198 in our view its the richness of diversity like a colorful tapestry that makes the world and our neighborhood such a wonderful place

2971204 but after i had gotten into the car brian stood by his door for awhile still having a conversation with the pretty blond
2971205 however the most important thing is that we showed commitment i believe we had a good game better than what we played against holland this is an indication that were getting to know ourselves better
2971206 my nervousness forced me to commit some errors this gave advantage to my opponent
2971207 i cannot say what really made me nervous she capitalised on that to stop me
2971208 we have met a number of times at the ioc training centre in germany and we have respect for one another
2971209 the usa will be a tough opponent they are a very good team but were not afraid of anyone we just want to go out and get the job done
2971210 this was a very good game tonight we made a few mistakes here and there but i am happy with the way my team played overall we are going to enjoy this moment
2971211 i believe that all of my players played well tonight and as a unit they were solid
2971212 please let me do my job i have faith in them and they are doing the job given to them by the coaching crew please football is not all about fancy stuff but how well the players play as a team
2971213 i know they are some of them dream team players who are more skilful and please the crowd more than they promise and okoronkwo but in the end we have to look at the overall impact on individual players in the team
2971214 now can we proceed with the extradition and the serious charges of kidnapping and rape

2971222 why would i do anything to destroy my 22 year career
2971223 as the backbone of the family ive destroyed the hopes of my wife and our two children
2971224 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety
2971225 calling on drivers in suffolk to stop putting child pedestrians lives at risk by speeding in residential areas
2971226 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money independent research has shown that there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year the government is clear that the best safety camera is one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding
2971227 recent government figures have shown that the number of people exceeding 30mph speed limits has fallen so the message is getting through
2971228 more people are getting tickets because speed limits are being enforced more vigorously more people are now beginning to view speeding in the same light as drinking and driving in that it is an anti social thing to do but there is still a long way to go

2971250 the city of tskhinvali which is in the midst of a humanitarian nightmare has again come under fire from georgian forces
2971251 georgians are also trying to flood the city where many remain trapped under rubble and could drown witnesses say georgia has been using cluster bombs on the city
2971252 the form in which the georgian sides actions took place cannot be called anything but genocide because they were on a large scale nature and targeted individuals the civilian population and peacekeepers who were fulfilling their duties to preserve peace
2971253 besides the information we receive shows that extremely serious crimes were committed people were killed burned crushed by tanks their throats were slashed
2971254 maybe an international tribunal should be set up specially for this case just as international tribunals were set up for other instances of massive extermination of people and massive destruction of cities
2971255 the responsibility for the deaths of innocent people in south ossetia lies with georgias leadership
2971256 since civilians and peacekeeper have died as a result of georgias attack
2971257 moscow can turn to the hague tribunal and the strasbourg human rights court to investigate the deaths of its citizens
2971258 any such conflict affects the internal political situation by stimulating flag waving patriotism
2971259 this is particularly unpleasant considering the extremely distressing anti georgia campaign we saw two years ago if the armed conflict continues to escalate i think the russian leadership will have to take the utmost measures to prevent anti georgian agitation in the country
2971260 few russians know about the roots of the conflict in south ossetia i think that the russian population is mostly indifferent to this problem
2971261 the majority of people are much more concerned about economic problems such as inflation and poverty than about foreign policy
2971262 motorola is not yet out of the woods but these are encouraging early signs of stabilization
2971263 developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching
2971264 by putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing you can then relay that information in real time to a coach and they can see for example what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique
2971265 its for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see
2971266 it is to help the athlete learn orientation as they are doing the dive
2971267 the challenge for us was putting them up in swimming pools that werent designed to take them
2971268 we are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body
2971269 the aerodynamics particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort thats expended
2971270 but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade off you are going to accept
2971271 it is very adjustable to different people but it also much better mimics the track cycling event

2971287 nani has gone through the same process as all the young players and you are looking for that jump up in performance level from the first season
2971288 his maturity should be better as well which is important
2971289 he is a very young 20 that immaturity showed itself against west ham at the end of the season that has cost us because he is missing for the first two games

2971294 they have approached the man who was armed with the firearm she said
2971295 they have challenged him to put the firearm down and hes turned and raised the firearm and shot himself
2971296 one of the reasons were excited about this is the real time alert capability
2971297 the system makes the analysis in milliseconds and the brokerage can take immediate action getting a few minutes lead time can make all the difference
2971298 this project was ill fated from its inception the safe systems of work designed to prevent an occurrence of this nature were disregarded at every level of the operation the approach taken was casual in the extreme

2971367 given the current economic uncertainties that are changing how many consumers choose to spend their money especially as it relates to luxury items its important for businesses to find more effective ways to fight through the competitive clutter and create a compelling value
2971368 our cards provide an inexpensive solution that creates opportunities for consumers to enjoy their favorite products and services from manicures and pedicures to massages and facials for far less than they would normally pay
2971369 through the smart circles spa program our clients have the opportunity to benefit from a plethora of new customers coming through their doors
2971370 partnering spas have experienced a 25 30 percent increase in revenue after participating in our card program
2971371 the results of our partnership with the smart circle far exceeded our expectations in terms of immediate results direct client contact and overall customer interest including a 30 percent increase in traffic in the first year
2971372 our staff was booked solid with clients from this program

2971374 it is clear that ebay has become a focal point for certain brand owners desire to exact ever greater control over e commerce
2971375 we believe that the courts overreach manifests itself through an attempt to impose in france a business model that restricts consumer choice through an anti competitive business practice
2971376 this ruling appropriately established that protecting trademarks is the primary burden of rights owners not marketplaces like ebay
2971377 the standard is not whether ebay could reasonably anticipate possible infringement but rather whether ebay continued to supply its services to sellers when it knew or had reason to know of infringement by those sellers
2971378 clearly ebay and other online market web sites may properly promote and facilitate the growth of legitimate secondary markets in brand name goods
2971379 appears quite obviously either through captions such as a fine imitation of a louis vuitton design or simply on the basis of the prices asked and of the quantities offered

2971399 we just thought a boom was going to happen and it really didnt
2971400 we didnt feel it was gaining the traction that we wanted it to
2971401 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
2971402 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013

2971404 gross margins from our natural gas segment continue to increase which enabled us to overcome the 1 2 million charge for the unconsummated acquisition and drive our improvement for the quarter compared to last year we are especially pleased with the success of our delmarva natural gas distribution operations in continuing their strong period over period growth despite the slowdown in new residential construction
2971405 while we are disappointed that the acquisition did not occur we will continue to evaluate other potential opportunities that will add value to our company consistent with our corporate strategy

2971411 we are not crossing the de facto border thats our key principle
2971412 russian peacekeeping troops have received no orders to invade georgian territory
2971413 a major part of operations to force the georgian side the georgian authorities into peace in south ossetia has been completed
2971414 he is seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
2971415 the military operations that we saw on saturday and since then including air and missile attacks have no relation to and go well beyond the cis peacekeeping operation
2971416 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
2971417 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies

2971443 because the fact is i am too busy dealing with the present
2971444 it was a separate division with its own secretary and it had eight full time employees
2971445 we had a great system of how to issue violations
2971446 people didnt want citations so they would get back to us within 30 days of the inspection to make sure that they had a reinspection
2971447 i could inspect a huge apartment building in about two hours and enter information in the vax in about 15 minutes everything from that point forward was automatic i could forget about it and go to the next building
2971448 we have landlords who dont want us there and tenants who dont want us there i am not going to park outside after an inspection and take a half hour to 45 minutes to input information
2971449 i literally told people well that was your first mistake
2971450 yeah i leaned on some people in code because frankly i thought they were anti business
2971451 i know that when i call or he calls and we say i need this done by x number of days and we come back in that timeframe it is going to be done
2971452 i know that they are going to take care of it because they would rather fix it than have me go there
2971453 i will get a complaint from a certain person and i will know just from talking to them that ok i am putting this in the computer you just learn
2971454 i would take a load off because right now all we can do is react to a complaint
2971455 in order to make things work and put the city on a positive level back on track we need to be proactive and we cant do that
2971456 numbers are down as one code enforcement officer was out for seven months and the other was out for nine weeks during fiscal year 2006

2971459 although the title phrase may still conjure up images of domesticity this exhibition provides an antidote through artworks that inhabit and comment on self imposed limitations
2971460 a phrase that prior to 1970s feminism and perhaps even today conjures up images of domesticity and of a time when women were expected to only inhabit a limited sphere this exhibit proves the antithesis of that belief by inhabiting and commenting on a number of realms where their only restrictions are self imposed
2971461 if womens issues are still relevant than why not focus on them
2971462 all this is thought provoking deserving a wider conversation about the control of the arts in boston mentoring and the role of women
2971463 i have noticed that women in their 40s and up tend to remember and care about womens
2971464 sic in response to comments on the show i currently have work in a group show at the bromfield gallery entitled
2971465 apparently there are many of us that still confront issues about what

2971467 if things go right we can start talking about forever
2971468 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
2971469 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
2971470 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
2971471 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
2971472 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
2971473 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
2971474 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
2971475 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
2971476 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
2971477 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
2971478 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications

2971519 now it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing there is filth on the floor and it must be scraped up with a muckrake and there are times and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed i hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker every man who on the platform or in book magazine or newspaper with merciless severity makes such an attack provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful
2971520 the media are like water and electricity a few intelligent people realise this but the masses dont understand there is not enough conscious thought given to understanding that journalism is as vital to survival as water
2971521 the real problem with the commercialism of the media is when the media get to a point where they dont have a moral leg to stand on and things have gotten a long way down the line already were in territory where there is maximum investment in advertising and minimal focus and investment in editorial
2971522 the media have become totally dependent on advertising the newspapers business model has changed over time so they are now not purveyors of news but purveyors of advertising the main client is not the reader but the advertisers the focus has changed to keep advertisers happy
2971523 management spends much more on the salaries and perks of sales staff than that of reporters this is the emphasis of their business so when the downturn comes the marketing budget is upped and editorial is slashed this is because editorial is seen as a pure cost not an income source

2971578 budgeting and planning driven by appropriations rather than by needs
2971579 instead of concentrating this expanded research effort in a few highly secure facilities and staffing them with scientists with experience handling dangerous pathogens the bush administration and congress decided to disperse the spending nationwide by building a host of new high containment labs around the country
2971580 no single federal agency is responsible for tracking the number and location of high and maximum containment labs in the united states or for determining the safety and security risks associated with the spread of such labs
2971581 it also would improve oversight at the labs setting incident reporting and safety standards and improving worker training
2971582 in addition the bill would update the list of regulated pathogens to include new genetically engineered strains and evaluate how the regulations affect the sharing of scientific research in the rapidly evolving field of biological science
2971583 recent public attention to the 2001 anthrax attacks is a reminder of the importance of controlling access to dangerous biological agents and toxins that could be used for bioterrorism
2971584 it is vital that we have strong regulations in place to ensure that dangerous select agents are kept out of the hands of those who would do us harm

2971604 as you will appreciate rolling news is one of the most expensive radio formats to maintain yet it intrinsically provides a poor opportunity for revenue generation
2971605 it is inherently a low hours format with listeners generally choosing to dip in and out from time to time rather than staying with the station for any continuous period this makes it a relatively unattractive format for advertisers
2971606 the stations appeal is further diminished by its presence on am a platform which is likely to see further ongoing decline as audiences move increasingly to digital platforms
2971607 we believe that rolling news does have a place in the london radio landscape and that during the day lbc news 1152 is clearly valued by the 200 000 or so listeners that tune in every week however the high cost of the service combined with its low revenue potential means that it is no longer possible to sustain rolling news as a 24 hour format
2971608 that during the overnight hours much information will be duplicated
2971609 we think that the changes as requested should not notably disenfranchise the overnight am listener who by the nature of a rolling news service will tend to dip listen rather than listen for a length of time

2971689 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2971690 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2971691 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2971692 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2971693 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2971694 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2971695 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2971696 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2971697 why do you think hillary clinton should or should not receive a nomination

2971705 saddam hussein ha detto che fece eliminare alcuni abitanti di villaggi sciiti doveva essere ovviamente impiccato ma gli attuali leader georgiani che hanno raso al suolo in poco tempo dieci villaggi osseti e facevano schiacciare con i carri armati bambini e vecchi che facevano bruciare vivi civili nelle loro case vengono difesi
2971706 preoccupato per luso sproporzionato della forza ha detto la sua portavoce carmen romero e per la mancanza di rispetto dellintegrit territoriale della georgia
2971707 centinaia di carri armati russi stanno entrando nella citt di gori
2971708 bisogna fermarli al pi presto i russi andranno avanti non si fermano nemmeno davanti ai civili stanno facendo un vero e proprio massacro
2971709 bisogna che torni la pace per proteggere tutte le popolazioni civili questa la sola cosa da questo punto di vista saakashvili ha accettato praticamente tutte le proposte che abbiamo avanzato
2971710 ci rivolgeremo a tutte le organizzazioni internazionali per far riconoscere il genocidio perdite cos pesanti per un piccolo popolo sono irreversibili
2971711 ero l per turismo continua ci hanno comunicato di non lasciare lalbergo vedevamo queste donne che piangevano era una citt in silenzio la nostra ambasciata stata meravigliosa ci hanno rassicurato intorno a tbilisi cerano i bombardamenti
2971712 una preoccupazione molto estesa per la crescita della violenza in georgia
2971713 la sua continuazione avrebbe serie conseguenze nelle relazioni con gli stati uniti
2971714 if you design your coding pattern well its possible to take this mishmash pattern and use digital signal processing to decode the pattern to pull out an image of the scene
2971715 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
2971716 theres been a lot of talk about the fact that we havent won the 100 freestyle the last 20 years and the 400 free relays have been spanked around the last two olympics
2971717 theres never one in my memory not running down somebody that holds the world record thats on their game that was incredible
2971718 i didnt go in this morning planning on breaking the world record
2971719 i was just trying to get in and have a good swim like last night and pace myself to go into the final its going to be a tough final and im excited to be a part of that
2971720 youve got to tip your hat to someone who goes 58 9 in an olympic final
2971721 i knew that i wanted to swim fast once and i went for it tonight and obviously that was my best swim which i was trying to do but unfortunately three guys went faster than me
2971722 its just been a really tough year for me obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of affects your confidence a little bit i felt good going into the race tonight but obviously everybody brought their a game everybody swam really really well and i think those are the top times in the world this year its just a true testament to how well beijing has done allowing the athletes to really perform at their peak and thats awesome thats what you want at an olympics and theyve done an amazing job as a host
2971723 the whole organization from top to bottom has treated him like a king
2971724 as big of a cub fan as he is we treat him like hes part of the team
2971725 he wishes he could be at every game hes a joy to be around
2971726 these meeting have been very positive and very interesting both for player and for ourselves
2971727 it helps the players learn the new laws and for us to get a feeling for the players reactions ive gained a lot from the exchanges well remain firm on certain positions while on others were waiting to see how it turns out and there are others where well no doubt change our way of seeing things
2971728 im expecting a lot from the opening top 14 matches
2971729 when i hear coaches tell me the new laws are complicated i reply that we have no reason to be envious of the southern hemisphere we have the players all thats missing is the will its up to us to step up
2971730 its a good law that adds a dynamic to number eights breaking from the scrum that said im yet to be convinced that well use this law to its maximum effect in france im not sure were seeing the same dynamism in the top 14 compared to the tri nations
2971731 the clubs in france are still a bit reserved the priority is on keeping possession rather than opening up
2971732 last year we realised that we accepted a lot of mauls that could have been considered as collapsed
2971733 this year were legalising what unfortunately we allowed to happen last year after that once the maul has been collapsed it will be up to the referees to manage the situation because players will try to enter from the sides
2971734 from what ive gathered so far the players dont really seem concerned but thatll be tested in the opening matches of the championship
2971735 therell be less teaching than people are expecting we want to anticipate what well see in the championship
2971736 its the international norm we want to change the attitudes to tackles notably with all those players who voluntarily go to ground in an illicit way
2971737 we want to give a chance back to defenders who stay on their feet and even out the battle
2971738 mentally the players are struggling to come around to it theyre not used to coming in from the bottom up weve all been wrong myself included in accepting players coming in and going down
2971739 the new law is very interesting for full backs who want to inject some energy into the game
2971740 theyre the most sceptical about the tackle situation and rucks were they must go from the bottom up
2971741 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2971742 i think they knew that history was being made tonight obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity it was enough to make your spine tingle a little bit
2971743 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2971744 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2971745 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt bryant said
2971746 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back
2971747 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something
2971748 i would have liked to obviously play better but i had a good week
2971749 i had my ups and downs had a little go of it early in the round and tried to make a move
2971750 he was very good its nice to see him back
2971751 hopefully he got his second wind and he can do what he did in the first half
2971752 they score an awful lot of runs and if you make a mistake they dont foul it off they hit it
2971753 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
2971754 i just wanted to shoot something good and see what happened
2971755 i thought maybe i could catch boo but he was playing right in front of me so i knew by the last few holes that wasnt going to happen
2971756 but we are a strong team we will never fall down and stay down we will always come back up
2971757 we went out and showed the world and every team out there what were here for
2971758 im confident well be stronger on team finals now that all this dramas out of the way
2971759 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2971760 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2971761 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2971762 it was looking like sergios day and i just wanted to hang around and get some opportunities
2971763 i knew what i had to do i was playing catch up and had to take on the shots on the back nine that would mean the difference between winning or losing
2971764 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility to win or lose in a major
2971765 you know the good thing about it is i i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
2971766 they deserted me then those guys were having such a good battle every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play out there in a championship like this
2971767 i really felt id won the pga there with that shot
2971768 i knew that if i holed this putt i would win the pga and if i didnt that sergio would win the pga
2971769 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot
2971770 we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were supposedly in a slump thats pretty amusing
2971771 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2971772 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2971773 overall i feel like we obviously didnt play well as a team
2971774 i was disappointed that some of them didnt do better
2971775 weve been having a good training camp were excited to come out and play with the confidence weve had so far we have so many veterans when we step on the field we feel confident we should score
2971776 the reason why other portals may not have done this yet is for aesthetic reasons
2971777 they want to have a home page more editorially pure just like the front page of a newspaper
2971778 and every space in the world is being monetized as far as advertising
2971779 i felt good about my game all week and i told my mom that if i just played the way ive been playing i would have a chance
2971780 all week it was just a matter of execution play one hole one shot at a time
2971781 scott played well all week and he did again today
2971782 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2971783 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2971784 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2971785 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2971786 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2971787 no matter how much we like her well break up but until the end our pride will still be left with us
2971788 wa your stature is so good can i touch gt

2971790 this year marks a turning point in e discovery where corporations are making significant investments to lower the cost risk and complexity of e discovery
2971791 we believe the trends within our own customer base are consistent with the views of the larger market people are getting smarter about the technologies and processes they are implementing and the legal system is developing a better sense of awareness about e discovery these two factors are creating a real sense of urgency for both enterprises and law firms as they increase their focus on e discovery
2971792 our record 2nd quarter financial results reflected the beginning of agfeeds successful large scale commercial hog production and management execution of our growth plan synergistic benefits from our two prospering business segments continue to drive greater cost benefits and stronger operating efficiency agfeed has direct access to the wealthiest pork consumer markets in china and captures some of the highest hog selling prices we anticipate continued rapid expansion in these key consumer regions and expect to deliver strong financial results in our 3rd and 4th quarters
2971793 agfeed management has a realistic understanding of our business through the last 13 years of our successful corporate history we have highly skilled founders managers who are industry experts in feed and hog production we believe the pork consuming chinese population of approximately 1 2 billion people will continue to demand fresh pork on a daily basis additionally it is our belief that chinas rapid urbanization the potentially new boost to the chinese economy from the beijing olympics and the drastic reduction in backyard hog production output have created hog shortages throughout china and are presenting agfeed with historical land grabbing growth opportunities for agfeed going forward we expect to have an expanding business for years to come we are focused on execution and delivering superb financial results for our shareholders
2971794 on the strategic front agfeed is a ready platform for entering chinas vast and highly profitable integrated hog pork markets

2971799 we are pleased that rambler has attracted a general manager of such high calibre and strong international project management experience jasons appointment along with other recent hires will strengthen the rambler team as the ming mine progresses through its engineering studies into construction and ultimately production
2971800 todays market should also be viewed as fertile ground for opportunity
2971801 the mortgage turmoil doesnt seem to be going away anytime soon
2971802 so instead of fighting the downturn were seizing the opportunity to be a part of the solution
2971803 weve only seen the tip of the iceberg of housing and mortgage related problems
2971804 the market has been hammered by bad loans but we take pride in a hands on approach to getting borrowers back in the market be that through new loan terms or some debt forgiveness we can help turnaround a dim outlook and turn a profit at the same time
2971805 i had told myself long ago that three books in a series are enough for my attention span and so after i devoted myself to the trio of books in the tales of london series then wrote a table by the window my contemporary novel
2971806 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends

2971810 urban shadows feux de signalisation rue jean pierre timbaud paris 2000
2971811 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2971812 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2971813 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2971814 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2971815 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2971816 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2971817 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2971818 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2971819 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2971820 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2971821 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
2971822 i dont see any change in chelsea that is to me they dont look as if they are going to find acres of improvement simply because they are a very experienced team
2971823 but that experienced team can easily win the league because its not exactly disintegrating they are at their very peak i would think as a team
2971824 so its much like the liverpool team of 1989 exactly that same format of experience of that liverpool team
2971825 i know it was a very experienced team but thats the difficulty of football clubs
2971826 ive only had a few days of filming with her so far
2971827 i think she should get all her plastic surgery reduced
2971828 she doesnt look natural i dont think men find her attractive
2971829 we werent friends we werent always fighting but sharon made it clear that she didnt like me so she wont be missed not by me
2971830 bouazzas worth around 2m and roy hodgson has helped us out theyve helped us out with the finances as well so were very very pleased with the signing
2971831 now i need to patient in the market in bringing in two more players if i get the ones i want i think well do better
2971832 as for bailey all i would say without telling any porkies is that its true finances are very tight here so we will see but they won against peterborough on saturday so hopefully theyll be in a good mood
2971833 of course the carling cup is very serious for us because the finance which comes from a good cup run will help me it is a competition which championship sides have not really done well in so we hope to do well
2971834 he told me mom tell me the news isnt true tell me brett favre hasnt retired he wanted to hold onto the memories he left
2971835 when you send a child off to war things happen
2971836 nothing goes by god without him giving permission i believe something good is going to come from it i dont know what that is yet but my husband and i have faith ill understand it someday just not now
2971837 he got called up and knew he wouldnt be back until august
2971838 i would have loved to have had him back then his dad told me that he wouldnt be back until november
2971839 i want to get a message across that i dont want any of my players to go there has been a certain amount of hovering but i would hope the teams respect our situation now the season has started
2971840 i want other clubs to respect my squad as our season is under way no manager wants last minute interruptions to his plans lets face it all of my players have been available from the end of last season clubs should have made their approaches early
2971841 estamos m s cerca de hacer posible un manto de invisibilidad al haber demostrado que con ese nuevo material se puede doblegar la luz a nuestra voluntad

2971855 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2971856 you have to get focused and give it a go
2971857 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2971858 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2971859 thats hard to do were just trying to pick up the slack it was a good day all the way around
2971860 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate early on especially in the first inning they were sitting on my slider thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back
2971861 its like a broken record getting behind by a lot early
2971862 i cant remember a clean 1 2 3 first inning its been a while it makes for a long day and a long week
2971863 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2971864 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2971865 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2971866 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2971867 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away

2971877 the poor performance of rackspace hosting inc on its debut of trading friday may be seen as a disappointment for the moribund ipo market but the company clearly had a tough story to sell
2971878 analysts had expected a relatively warm response to the new issue but rackspace faces tough competition in its attempt to produce long term growth
2971879 rackspace took the ipo plunge friday and fell flat on its face which will only make other startups more hesitant to follow its lead
2971880 on its opening day the stock price plunged 20 to 10 ironically enough wall street was hoping that the rackspace deal would help spark the ipo market after all rackspace is a great company
2971881 rackspaces ipo was a crashing disappointment a more deserving tech company one hopes will come to the public markets soon and erase the memory of rackspaces broken offering
2971882 there has been a growing buzz in the cloud computing community that rackspace with their large corporate hosting customer base may make for an ideal acquisition by a hardware vendor looking to adjust for the coming shift toward internet centric computing aka cloud computing

2971925 ive been in the game 20 odd years and i can deal with most things
2971926 but its just annoying to see some of this stuff coming out before the league season has even started
2971927 if we lose the first five games of the season then yes but that hasnt happened
2971928 until then people have got to give us a chance
2971929 weve just got to get on with it and make sure we are ready for the start of the season
2971930 its not just that article people have been making bids for benni and we just cant seem to settle ourselves down because people want to unsettle us its not fair and its not right
2971931 i think people seem to see us as a selling club and were not
2971932 our record speaks for itself over the last few years in where weve finished in the league
2971933 people think they can come in to disrupt our players and unsettle the new manager before the season starts
2971934 everybody needs a chance not just me but every manager
2971935 at the end of the day we are trying to do something here

2971960 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
2971961 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
2971962 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
2971963 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
2971964 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
2971965 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
2971966 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
2971967 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
2971968 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
2971969 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
2971970 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
2971971 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
2971972 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
2971973 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
2971974 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
2971975 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
2971976 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
2971977 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2971978 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2971979 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2971980 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2971981 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2971982 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

2971990 we are really in serious troubles the russian tanks are coming to the whole territory of georgia from all sides there were a lot of air attacks during the two last days also no idea what will be the future of my country even if the usa will decide to help georgia by its military forces there would be the end of the country it could become the land of the war of two empires
2971991 south ossetian autonomous republic was established by the ussr on the territory of georgia in 1921 georgians and ossetians lived there together but georgians were in absolute majority there when the ussr collapsed the government of the south ossetia declared the independence and stated its desire to join russia but of course georgian population and the government of the country refused the wide escalation started then and it was the severe war there in early 90th but georgia loose the war as russian military forces went to the country and supported minority we had a lot of georgian refugees from the region which gained the status quo but stayed as a non recognized republic until now there never been the peace in the region during the years but the situation tensed last weeks when the massive shootings from both sides took place because city tskinvali the center of the region was circled by georgian villages do not ask me now who started according to the peace journalism theory journalist never should ask this question and i really dont know because there is no one truth in such situations then the government of georgia started a special operation aiming to restore the territorial integrity of the state and to let the refugees come back to their homes but as it was expected russia immediately reacted and started bombing whole georgia i was just informed that the georgian side just announced officially that the country is ready to fulfill russias ultimatum and to leave the territory of the conflict region lets see whether it would be enough to stop intervention we are really expecting everything as fighting with this empire georgia got a very sad experience during two centuries unfortunately there are a lot of victims from the both sides and a huge material damage for the small country
2971992 oh god oh dylan it must be cold down there it is cold enough on top in november the dirtiest month of the year that killed you on the ninth vile day if only i could take you a bowl of your bread and milk and salt that you always drunk at night to warm you up

2972118 your body is trying to repair itself and that stimulates your metabolism plus youre usually on a liquid diet for the first few days afterward you can lose about 10 pounds so if you keep that off watch your diet and get back to exercising you can look really good
2972119 souhaite sadresser directement au peuple pakistanais et quil ne conna t pas lourdou
2972120 qui a b n fici plus de quatre cents glises
2972121 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2972122 you have to get focused and give it a go
2972123 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2972124 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2972125 i have to make all the right judgments as far as my health as far as my ankle before i go out there on the football field
2972126 when i go out on that football field i want to be running 100 mph with no restrictions thats what i am trying to accomplish being on the sidelines getting healthy and going out and being explosive and jumping up in the air and catching ball
2972127 numbers wise you look at the depth chart and you kind of say theres no way im making this team
2972128 and i tried to talk to him about that early on telling him dont look at the numbers just go out there and play your game and let what happens happen
2972129 hes had a phenomenal camp hes really working the slot well hes got great speed on the outside and hes a tough guy
2972130 he gets it but hes still young the challenge will be when hes playing earlier in the game against the other teams top people then youll see
2972131 so until he gets on their best nickel defensive back and best corners and has to go against really the top people in the league then well see
2972132 it was like somebody shot me in the back of the leg
2972133 its kind of a hot pain like somebody was stabbing in me there with a knife
2972134 im not sure if it was the last step before i hit the bag or the one after
2972135 it was kind of between there it all happened real fast
2972136 i dont know if well see willie again the rest of this year
2972137 my goal is to be ready before the end of year but im not going to be stupid about it
2972138 i understand that my legs are my game i need to make sure its healthy if and when i go back out there
2972139 this one i could kind of hear and feel a pop
2972140 hes playing well no doubt hes got a lot of talent his forehand is huge it will be interesting to see how he does
2972141 he certainly has the weapons it depends on how he builds on it
2972142 if i want to be in the top 10 i have to beat them highly ranked players on every surface and im beginning to do that
2972143 i hadnt been playing much and kind of made the final here out of nowhere
2972144 i was able to play this many days in a row and not have any health issues thats positive
2972145 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2972146 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2972147 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2972148 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2972149 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2972150 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2972151 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2972152 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2972153 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2972154 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2972155 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2972156 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2972157 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2972158 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2972159 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2972160 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2972161 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2972162 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2972163 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2972164 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2972165 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality

2972172 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2972173 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2972174 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2972175 character may be manifested in the great moments but it is made in the small ones
2972176 little things seem nothing but they give peace like those meadow flowers which individually seem odorless but all together perfume the air

2972180 i was completely sucked into the olympics and various things around the house here
2972181 keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great
2972182 i was feeling a little bit of panic because of the injury because it really hurt when it first happened
2972183 it eased up a little as i was laying there maybe from adrenaline or something but i was thinking that the same thing happened to me in 2004 when i was in college and might have been able to make the olympic team in the 200
2972184 that was one of the greatest experiences of my life and i will always remember it
2972185 i dont know how hes taking it but i would assume theres a lot of pressure
2972186 regardless of what anybody says people in his country and most other countries are expecting him to come home with that gold medal
2972187 a guy came up to me in the athletes village cafeteria yesterday and mentioned i hope you dont break up our sweep you know 1 2 we laughed about it and joked around but im pretty sure thats a real thing i mean asafa powell has been around for a long time hes been a world record holder and that means a lot to him usain bolt is a guy who likes to have a lot of fun but he is the world record holder now and hell try to hold onto that
2972188 right now there hasnt been this much hype around one event in a long time asafa is a very confident strong runner usain bolt has come onto the scene in track those two guys have done things that a lot of people have never seen before
2972189 myself i have one championship under my belt and im the american record holder i kind of fall into that class with the 9 7 runners thats whats making it all so amazing with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible

2972208 the panel judge has found that the two defendants are not returning to thailand or presenting themselves to the court by the deadline which violates their bail conditions
2972209 the court has decided to confiscate their bail money and issue arrest warrants for the two defendants
2972210 i expected everything would be better that i might have a chance to prove my innocence and receive a fair trial when i returned to thailand

2972234 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2972235 the strengthening of the peacekeeping force is aimed at ruling out a repetition of the situation russian peacekeepers faced in tskhinvali
2972236 our troops have to defend civilians and avert a humanitarian catastrophe
2972237 we do not plan to break into georgian territory beyond the borders marked to the peacekeepers
2972238 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2972239 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan

2972243 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
2972244 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2972245 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2972246 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2972247 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2972248 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2972249 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
2972250 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
2972251 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
2972252 connecting microrna genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells
2972253 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
2972254 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
2972255 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
2972256 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
2972257 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity
2972258 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle
2972259 this is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans
2972260 thats the only time since i owned the team that i felt that way
2972261 i was happy for kevin do i say gee why couldnt that have happened here yes but i dont harbor bad feelings against anybody that an nba title was my goal and you had him here so it seems like it was the best chance of having a person of that caliber we tried to bring people in around him but quite frankly the last couple of years we were going nowhere
2972262 so low key so unassuming if you ran into him on the street youd never know
2972263 they put the guys they trust the most the closest to the money
2972264 i dont defend myself and i dont defend kevin and say mistakes havent been made
2972265 people think im way too loyal to kevin and i should replace him
2972266 if i worried about kevins integrity he wouldnt be here for a minute if i worried about whether he really cared or not those are the things that are critical to me i know he doesnt do anything bad because hes lazy or because hes not intelligent he takes risks and he has been wrong on some of those risks if i knew somebody who could make it right all the time i wouldnt have any trouble having that person work for me
2972267 practice hard play hard be good all that type of stuff
2972268 i asked him to help me out and he jumped in
2972269 its a learning process youve got to give him the tools the people around him who will challenge him who will question him earlier in the process we have done that and he has not fought that some people fight that type of thing
2972270 we sit down as a group now and im telling you they dont always agree with kevin and kevin doesnt always agree with them but i think the results are better theyre coming up with better conclusions
2972271 hes in every meeting hes in on everything i dont know that fred would make better decisions than kevin would whats interesting now is they dont always agree thats interesting to me they challenge each other i think they make each other better
2972272 in some of your businesses you try to maximize profit my co owners with the timberwolves we want to win we dont have to make a lot of money doing it but we dont want to lose money either
2972273 when youre a very very talented person you tend to go toward the thing that challenges you
2972274 if anythings too easy it doesnt keep his attention sports is such a challenging environment to be consistently successful theres not many things that can challenge glen taylor he has accomplished quite a bit
2972275 se la notizia che sta trapelando in queste ore dovesse corrispondere al vero non potrei che confermare quanto gi dichiarato a roma presso il ministero delle attivit produttive ci troviamo di fronte a degli sconsiderati che stanno da anni mortificando non solo gli operai ma un intero territorio oramai hanno perso tutta la credibilit che gli era stata concessa ma a questi signori rivolgo ancora una volta un accorato appello se non sanno cosa fare meglio che vanno via dal nostro territorio fino ad oggi hanno solo procurato miseria e problemi alle famiglie dellagro caleno

2972277 una diretta offesa al testamento ed allo spirito di quel grande e generoso padre carismatico che fu don bosco anima ispiratrice e fondatore del movimento salesiano abbiamo bisogno dei salesiani a piedimonte matese io stessa mi reco tante volte nelloratorio per visitare la chiesa e partecipare alla messa i salesiani devono continuare a svolgere il loro servizio a piedimonte la gente ne ha bisogno toglierli da questo luogo significa cancellare un pezzo di storia e di lavoro svolto a servizio della comunit della formazione e delleducazione dei giovani unoffesa lo ribadisco unoffesa alla memoria don bosco non capisco con quale criterio si ragiona e come possano venire in mente certe decisioni insensate
2972278 ma siete o non siete uomini di chiesa di servizio mi domando cristo disse un giorno che cera pi gioia in cielo per una pecora ritrovata che per 99 giuste volete chiudere loratorio a piedimonte bene chiudetelo ma nessuno vi toglier il rimorso dalla coscienza di avere abbandonato allo sbaraglio le speranze di tante persone e di tanti giovani che frequentavano questo luogo con assiduit per non parlare del giudizio divino quando dio vi domander avevo fame e non mi avete dato da mangiare sete e non mi avete dato da bere forestiero e non mi avete ospitato nudo e non mi avete vestito malato e non mi avete visitato e quante anime malate oggi che vivono allo sbaraglio senza punti di riferimento e luoghi oratoriali di ritorvo quante beh la parabola la conoscete meglio di me voglio sperare dunque che la vostra sia stata solo una desicione presa in un attimo di disorientamento e che dunque a questa possa avere prevalso il lume della sapienza col debellare del tutto l assurda decisione di chiudere la filiale di piedimonte miei cari

2972385 desde el momento en el que una compa a a rea emite el t tulo de transporte independiente de quien haya sido el intermediario existe una obligaci n contractual entre el transportista y el pasajero
2972386 facua duda si el motivo por el que la aerol nea ha cancelado las reservas a trav s de las agencias es que stas cometen irregularidades como asegura ryanair o que le est n suponiendo la p rdida de negocios como por ejemplo la contrataci n de seguros que aparecen preseleccionados al comprar billetes en su p gina web sin aclarar que son opcionales una pr ctica que motiv las denuncias de facua el pasado enero contra ryanair y otras ocho aerol neas y agencias

2972394 this looks like a great idea i didnt have a website so i had my link point to samaritans purse samaritanspurse org franklin grahams organization billy grahams son they do wonderful work all around the world
2972395 i also think that the idea will appeal to small groups and individuals

2972397 after paying off all of my personal and business debts the rest of it will go directly to my church fletcher memorial baptist church fmbaptist
2972398 i have so many bills that i had to start keeping them in a large box because they just wouldnt fit into a file folder anymore i have several debt collection companies hounding me they constantly harass me my daughter just started college last fall so thats another financial worry for me as i want her to go to school during my illness my business suffered greatly and even two years later i still struggle every day to ensure my families basic necessities are taken care of its getting a little better each month but i still have a lot of hard work ahead of me a little over a year ago my church fletcher memorial baptist church statesboro ga started a building campaign to fund a much needed life center building my wife and i made a weekly commitment to the building fundraising in addition to our tithing i know there is more that i can do and with the five million dots website i can ive been digging my way out of debt for two years and while i am seeing progress it is still very difficult and my family cuts corners budgets and does whatever we have to do pay our bills and meet our church commitments i have a real burden on my heart to help my church raise funds for the building my church family has helped my family so much over the last couple of years they are an amazing group of caring people once all of my personal debts are paid off and some money is set aside for my daughters education the rest of the funds raised from the website will go to my church to pay for the life center building needless to say 75 percent or more of the funds raised will go directly to my church the life centers projected cost is around 2 3 million dollars i would love to be able to fund that and give even more to help further evangelism in and around our community
2972399 employees are struggling to keep on top of to do lists and think the answer is to work harder eating a sandwich at their desk as opposed to taking a full lunch break and also not having sufficient breaks during the rest of the day
2972400 but these breaks are essential for staff to perform at their best and cope with the daily pressures of work managers should be encouraging staff to take lunch breaks their performance and ultimately the business may suffer otherwise
2972401 the vast majority of people are having lunch at their desk while working thats the average person now very rarely do they get out of the office
2972402 if senior management create a culture that lunch is for wimps its counterproductive we all need breaks
2972403 people feel they have to get to work early stay late and not take lunch breaks and i think its going to get worse because of job insecurity people will want to show more commitment and that means working through their lunch and staying late
2972404 although there are times when people have to work through they should try to get out two or three times a week for a good hour particularly in summer be brave because in the end you will be judged by your output not by your presenteeism
2972405 i definitely feel refreshed and mentally sharper when i come back if i dont get out at lunchtime the day just feels like one constant grind all the way through and i really like the way it breaks up the day

2972412 i think i can imagine a life with this guy
2972413 we like the same things hes really great company and he makes me laugh
2972414 but how well do you know this guy i mean how many times have you even been out with him
2972415 as happy in a bar on a friday night as pottering through a gallery on a sunday afternoon
2972416 the first thing he said was that he had recently turned 38 and wondered if he would ever have children
2972417 you remember when we used to talk about love and romance
2972418 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2972419 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2972420 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2972421 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2972422 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2972423 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2972424 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins

2972431 the temple of the most high begins with the human body which houses our life essence of our existence
2972432 if its not working for sylvan ebanks blake or andy keogh then weve got two good options to throw on
2972433 we didnt have that last season losing the strikers we had weve got better strikers now with sam scoring on his debut and big chris being a handful
2972434 theyre good competitors who like to get in the box and score and im pleased with both i think ive signed two good strikers who are going to help us score goals
2972435 theyve both got good goalscoring records because we like to play 4 4 2 theyre going to be important players for us
2972436 the conditions were such that chris and sam would make a difference maybe i should have put them on earlier or maybe my timing was impeccable because the goal came as soon as sam went on
2972437 it was a fantastic goal and the interchange between the two of them was terrific as was the finish
2972438 i was delighted for him that he scored on his debut and took his goal really well
2972439 hes only a young lad at 18 but hes already showed he can cope with this level and i was really pleased for him
2972440 the lads who came off the bench did really well for us and it was a great goal from sam
2972441 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2972442 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2972443 a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
2972444 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2972445 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbours
2972446 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
2972447 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
2972448 so far each step in the caucasus drama has put the conflict on a yet higher plane the next step will no longer be just about the caucasus or even europe remember the guns of august

2972455 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2972456 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2972457 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2972458 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2972459 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2972460 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2972461 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2972462 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2972463 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2972464 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2972465 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
2972466 waktu itu saya menyatakan kalau hal itu tidak bisa karena rekening organisasi tersebut tidak bisa menerima uang selain untuk kepentingan ibbi

2972469 saya memang tidak begitu jelas apakah waktu itu ingin menggunakan uang atau meminjam uang

2972502 the fai views with concern the escalation of hostilities in georgia ahead of next months world cup qualifier match in tbilisi
2972503 we will continue to work closely with the department of foreign affairs fifa uefa and the georgian football federation to keep fans informed of any updates and advice from these bodies as they become available
2972504 because of the situation in the georgia south russia region the football association of wales is keeping in close contact with the georgia football federation
2972505 at this time the nationwide international at the liberty stadium swansea is still scheduled to go ahead however we hope to have a further update from tbilisi later this afternoon
2972506 we can confirm that we are closely monitoring the situation in georgia
2972507 at this time it is too early to speculate on any possibilities we are in touch with the member associations
2972508 its something that i work with with sports psychologist bob rotella im better off i definitely have a little bit of i want to be fighting it
2972509 and thats why i have done well when things like this week when im not quite on my game ive won many a tournament where i felt i wasnt swinging as well as i could and performed poorly sometimes when i felt i was swinging well
2972510 so im a bit a little bit of a contrast like that
2972511 its a fascinating thing this week that i definitely didnt have my golf swing
2972512 my co ordination was out all week on thursday and friday i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough my game was going downhill very quickly out on the golf course
2972513 when i went back and had a look at it and had a discussion with my trainer at home it was possible that i was dehydrated and thats what caused the lack of co ordination
2972514 that gave me something tangible that i could actually pin it on and try and put some effort into it and give me the belief that if i can get my hydration right basically my co ordination would come back and whether it was the answer or not it certainly helped me focus on something and that was the important part of it

2972520 weve decided against releasing a 2009 version of money plus boxed product
2972521 microsoft money plus distribution efforts will focus on selling software online via download and we have discontinued traditional box sales of the software at retail i doubt this surprises many of you especially those whove discussed with me how annual releases dont make much sense for a product thats in its 17th version
2972522 broadband clearly is mainstream more and more people are shopping for software online particularly in the financial arena
2972523 this distribution model means less packaging which obviously is better for the environment clearly it makes sense for the marketplace todays consumers want instant gratification and last years sales percentages show that the immediacy of the download appeals to a large number of customers
2972524 online distribution means retailers can provide more inventory of our products but require less physical space to manage inventory
2972525 you come in ignorance estel liones how would you depart
2972526 therefore i will instruct you you will see this sign upon the ground
2972527 when you see that sign you will go to it immediately at a steady pace neither hurrying nor hanging back and only then may you embrace the power the weaving required must begin immediately and you may not leave that sign until it is completed
2972528 when the weave is complete you will see the sign again marking the way you must go again at a steady pace without hesitation
2972529 one hundred times you will weave in the order you have been given and in perfect composure
2972530 let no one ever speak of what has passed here it is for us to share in silence with the one who experienced it it is done
2972531 estel liones you will spend tonight in prayer and contemplation of the burdens you will take up on the morrow when you don the shawl of an aes sedai it is done
2972532 my whole life began to revolve around pregnancy it was excruciating
2972533 i asked myself all the usual questions why did it have to happen to us what did we ever do wrong it was a massive emotional drain every waking minute was consumed with the thought of having a baby
2972534 it put a lot of strain on us as a couple as well every month youd be roaring crying and trying to pick yourself back up again once you knew you werent pregnant by the time we got round to doing ivf the strain was tremendous
2972535 we learnt breathing techniques and relaxation therapy which was very useful when it came to dealing with that agonising wait for the phone call to tell you how many of your eggs have fertilised
2972536 we also did yoga classes and picked up some meditation techniques they were very simple things that could be used in everyday life but they were really effective
2972537 plus being surrounded by other couples who were in the same position as us was so much help we began to feel much more hopeful
2972538 after that we got pregnant pretty soon and although sadly we miscarried now we are expecting twins and we are over the moon
2972539 were only beginning to realise now that the incidence of anxiety and depression among ivf patients is actually huge
2972540 these people sadly are much more distressed than doctors realised given that there seems to be a strong correlation between distress and pregnancy from a medical point of view it makes sense to address those stress levels
2972541 what i see with the irish couples that i meet is that theyre panicking about getting on the ladder for ivf so that doesnt help
2972542 at every stage of that journey you need support i find cognitive behavioural therapy very useful because it challenges your core beliefs so many women think that pregnancy is never going to happen for them
2972543 we go right back to asking them about their behaviour in childhood about their worries fears and anxieties and then we come up with a plan of action
2972544 if a woman is stressed tearful or anxious then cbt can be very useful for her
2972545 cbt is very much here and now focused and ivf is a hugely stressful procedure both physically and emotionally for couples who are going through it one of the main things i focus on is their stress levels and how we can cope better with them
2972546 i was used to putting my mind to something and then getting it
2972547 so when the most natural thing in the world suddenly becomes the most difficult thats really hard
2972548 we try to find out is there anything that can be done to ease the burden of ivf for them for instance by taking time out during the cycle of treatment
2972549 we ask do they have a good diet what do they take to relieve stress are they active in a gym and if they are could they replace that with something more soothing like yoga or acupuncture or reflexology
2972550 its a rollercoaster ride for couples there are massive sad days where you have to let go of your hopes and dreams but i wouldnt like to portray it as being only a hard thing most people i see get through this programme pretty well if theyre united going in in the first place it is not all doom and gloom
2972551 i think its really good that doctors are beginning to realise how much stress levels impact on pregnancy itself
2972552 it hadnt really occurred to me when i started out just how much stress does affect you as i had always thought of myself generally as a fairly laid back person
2972553 but i remember when i was going through ivf having a huge screaming row with my mother
2972554 now i realise that if you are going to be anxious it does affect you and if theres anything you can do to relieve some of the anxiety of infertility it has to be worth doing

2972557 we worked closely with dr herve morvan of nottingham university on the computational fluid dynamics
2972558 as well as with ansys a sheffield based company who provided computer software used in the design
2972559 russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name
2972560 ll cool j called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2972561 we went to the junior olympics together fought at the same european tournaments and often ended up as room mates so i know the lad very well
2972562 out of all our lads out there joes the one who deserves the most success because hes always worked so hard he has done it the hard way never had any favours and hes not been spoon fed joes only 21 the same age as me but hes been training all his life
2972563 what i like about him is his hunger and determination i remember him telling me he was aiming for the 2008 olympics and this was way back in 2001 or 2002 he was a good fighter then but now hes turned into a man
2972564 when opponents see how tall i am they think ill go backwards
2972565 joe never gives up as a fighter if hes behind on points he keeps on coming forward and hes has the hunger every good fighter needs

2972570 this represented an important step in building a productive and successful working relationship between serco and our union
2972571 when they were non unionized if they had a problem the individual would have to go talk to management if he she didnt get satisfaction that was the end of it there was no recourse
2972572 the base has a serious historic problem recruiting and retaining air traffic controllers
2972573 thats not very good and were not proud of that but it does mean they pick the best of the best
2972574 here its the first experience for the air traffic controllers its an interesting one for them coming from the military
2972575 they the employees now have a security they did not have before
2972576 we would never leave a small local out in limbo like that
2972577 uhh christine i think you should come with us we all got into trouble for being with the boys and considering you were there im afraid you might get into trouble if you dont come to im sure that man noticed you to as it seems nothing escapes his eye
2972578 estel what has happened make it short and to the point
2972579 i was told by another accepted who had been told by an aes sedai
2972580 a yellow sister she said that i was to gather a group of novices to help me with a chore we were to pick herbs
2972581 when i returned after leaving these girls with their chore they had not completed it and were shamelessly flirting with a group of trainees whom master reikan is taking care of now
2972582 tell me estel do you think me a fool do i have the face of one because honestly i couldnt think of any other reason for you to tell me such an idiotic tale and expect me to swallow it up like a mindless child i know you so well more then id like to be truthful i could ask around for that alleged yellow sedai you speak of but im not going to even bother do that and you know why because that pathetic excuse of a lie doesnt deserve my slightest attention you sent them to the warders yards the warders yard light your ignorance has no end there is no kind of herb in the surroundings none at all and dont try disputing that because youd be proven wrong and that will earn you another new sparkly punishment added to whats coming your way of course so you keep that pretty little mouth shut pick yourself up and head to your room i want you here tomorrow first thing in the morning
2972583 in novice whites open the closet to your right youll find there a pair and next time you choose to act in vengeance dont
2972584 i am aware that your actual presence in the warders yard is not your fault and therefore you wont be to blame for that nor punished however your behaviour there will be anyone care to shine some light on this or do i need to make my own impression and punish you as i see fit oh and please dont lie to me you saw what that brought to estel i assure you her switching will be doubled i detest lies
2972585 i am aware that your actual presence in the warders yard is not your fault and therefore you wont be to blame for that nor punished
2972586 however your behaviour there will be anyone care to shine some light on this or do i need to make my own impression and punish you as i see fit
2972587 oh and please dont lie to me you saw what that brought to estel i assure you her switching will be doubled i detest lies
2972588 me and ely are here to drop off a bundle serena sedai
2972589 aerilyns not here right now so i suggest you leave the bundle on her desk perhaps if you have time you would like to join me for tea
2972590 remember your lessons ely well start filling this room with smoke if we dont move fast im afraid its a switching for the both of us
2972591 thank you serena care to come back with me and see what it is
2972592 me and ely are here to drop off a bundle serena sedai
2972593 aerilyns not here right now so i suggest you leave the bundle on her desk perhaps if you have time you would like to join me for tea
2972594 remember your lessons ely well start filling this room with smoke if we dont move fast im afraid its a switching for the both of us
2972595 blood and ashes girl find some bloody place to flaming hide aerilyns just down the goat kissing hall
2972596 burn me to the bloody pit of doom open damn you
2972597 bloody pots just because i had a few flaming drinks i made to scrub these pig kissing pots for the rest of my light forsaken life mothers milk in a cup
2972598 estel i wonder if you never heard me ask you to be at my quarters before the last meal
2972599 i disapprove of this greatly and am shocked that one such as you would rather spend your time here than with an aes sedai
2972600 serena sedai she was sent to me for a chore
2972601 estel i wonder if you never heard me ask you to be at my quarters before the last meal
2972602 i disapprove of this greatly and am shocked that one such as you would rather spend your time here than with an aes sedai
2972603 i was beginning to think i would be scrubbing pots for the rest of my life
2972604 this will not always happen if i am correct you seem to enjoy spirited drinks a little more than the others
2972605 you will get what comes to you in good time
2972606 now you will not hear this question much however we are not all the same here in the white tower that said what kind of things do you like estel besides getting into trouble
2972607 i like shopping horseback riding and just about anything that doesnt have to do with pots at this point
2972608 im afraid i never caught your name aes sedai and forgive me if im wrong but i believe youre a blue
2972609 i am serena morrigan of the blue ajah i do not think you guessed estel perhaps you are more observant than you give yourself credit for
2972610 to tell you the truth i never really liked scrubbing pots myself of course it did teach me a few things that i did not think i could learn
2972611 do you have a horse or would you like me to summon one for you
2972612 now we can go for a ride in the woods or into the city actually
2972613 i have some work to do in the city some people i need to see i think it would be good for you to come along what do you think
2972614 now we can go for a ride in the woods or into the city actually i have some work to do in the city some people i need to see i think it would be good for you to come along what do you think
2972615 serena sedai why did you choose the blue ajah im not sure which ajah i will choose yet and i am a long way from being raised to a full sister but many know which ajah they will choose when they are still novices
2972616 well accepted it is a good question yet i think if a girl knows the ajah she will choose before she is out of novice whites she is a fool
2972617 i chose the blue because i did not want to limit myself i knew that the blues had causes and i definitely had my own but i did not want to be devoted to only one i feel that wearing the blue shawl i can push myself in all sorts of directions i have two main causes two that i devote my life to one of them is ridding the world of darkfriends especially in high courts
2972618 i also have a soft spot for street urchins and will do all i can to make sure they get food and proper clothes sometimes i even conduct some lessons with them
2972619 do you see what i mean by not limiting myself i had choices to make as you do now and i might have gone green if i thought battling shadowspawn would be my whole lifes devotion however i feel as a blue i can expand that and make my mark in other aspects i feel as if i have free reign to come and go here as i please
2972620 have i answered any questions i would be happy to answer more
2972621 forgive me if im intruding but why how did you choose your causes
2972622 fighting the shadow seemed like an important thing for an aes sedai to do personally i chose it because i had dealings with darkfriends in my own family
2972623 i also think that it is more than likely that when the forsaken return and they will
2972624 i would not be surprised if they infiltrate the more well known houses typically of royal families it would not be odd for me to think that the dark one has already tainted the courts of the world
2972625 for the cause of street urchins and abandoned children well i was one of those myself a trolloc raid took my house and my family when i was just a child i slept in the streets and gutters when i had to and did things to acquire a stay at an inn or some food
2972626 a thought to ponder do male channelers have to struggle and rot within their minds before they die or destroy everything they love
2972627 now they are not expecting us however i suggest you be on your best behaviour
2972628 hello everyone i see that things are going in some direction
2972629 i have brought an accepted from the white tower her name is estel liones and she will be assisting me today i have come to speak with you and perhaps help you in some way
2972630 alright please everyone go back to what you were doing we will come around to each of you as soon as we can
2972631 we will go into tar valon after this and there we will discuss what you have seen here today i will let you accompany me for a moment but then i will have some things for you to do i have to meet with some of the adults here most of these children do not belong to the men and women you see here they belong to no one you may not like the things i ask you to do but i think it is better than washing pots and pans
2972632 for the cause of street urchins and abandoned children well i was one of those myself a trolloc raid took my house and my family when i was just a child i slept in the streets and gutters when i had to and did things to acquire a stay at an inn or some food
2972633 a thought to ponder do male channelers have to struggle and rot within their minds before they die or destroy everything they love
2972634 hush my little one go to sleep for in sleep dreams do come dream of clouds from which you leap dream of brooks steady as a drum gently my little one drift to slumber rest now safely where i am drift where problems dont encumber go to sleep my little lamb
2972635 i will have christine summoned she is the woman that looks after these two i think i would like for you to come around with me and speak with some of the village people
2972636 riana i need to know from you what more this place needs i thank you for taking so many children however i know there is more i can do money is not much of an issue i see the dilapidated houses and everyone looks as if they havent eaten in years an adult can hardly live n these conditions let alone a child
2972637 if you will please fetch me the purse from my saddlebags
2972638 thank you estel riana this purse may have more coin in it than you have seen in a long time however it is only for making this little village into something better than it is now as i said before you cannot live like this and children will die if the state of affairs does not change i put you in charge of this task renovating the houses maybe building more buying cattle and more seeds for the garden i will return and check up on things here if i see nothing has changed i will take further action do you understand me
2972639 people cannot always be trusted with a large sum of coin understand that i care for them all but i know that money equals power in a lot of minds if i did not trust riana i would not have given her the coin it was a fair amount i hope she does the right thing with it
2972640 perhaps i well send you back here to check on matters
2972641 now what is it that you would like to do there is much of the day left i assume there is something in the city you would wish to do
2972642 people cannot always be trusted with a large sum of coin understand that i care for them all but i know that money equals power in a lot of minds if i did not trust riana i would not have given her the coin it was a fair amount i hope she does the right thing with it
2972643 why arent more people aware of the destitution these people live in all my life i never knew people lived in such poor conditions just because they were born into them i always thought the poor were those were too lazy too work or werent good for anything ive never before felt pity for the poor why dont more people try to help them
2972644 well more people dont try to help them because they think like you have some of those children could be channelers estel imagine that one day they could be like us part of the white tower with some of the most power in the world
2972645 have what you like accepted wine is even permitted at low consumption
2972646 i can only hope that what you have seen today will change some of the things you have learned in your earlier life the poor sometimes need a boost to get them going in the right direction granted some will not choose that direction but there are many that have had their dreams shot down by things they could not control
2972647 now tell me how are your studies going any thoughts on where you will be heading in the near future
2972648 i can only hope that what you have seen today will change some of the things you have learned in your earlier life
2972649 my studies are going well or at least relatively so
2972650 as for my near future i will be training with the warders and keeping an eye out for any possible warder prospects i might meet down in the yards
2972651 the greys and the greens would definitely provide me with enough excitement to keep me alive but there are things more important to me than battles and politics
2972652 i guess that leaves the blue ajah and i definitely know a few causes i could devote my life to
2972653 i think that the possibility of having so many causes is what brought me to the blue ajah i knew that the other ajahs had specific things that they did but i was drawn to the thought of being able to leave the white tower when i wanted and to dedicate my life to one or more things i didnt have to choose and give up the things that i really wanted to do
2972654 i trained in the yards as well at times you will get looks from your peers because they do not believe we need anything but the one power to protect us i however beg to differ having been cut off from the true source a few times i knew that weapons training would come in handy whether my sisters agreed with me or not
2972655 i have a few causes one you experienced today i also fight the shadow by weeding darkfriends out of the high courts i spend most of my time doing that and the cause i do not believe you are ready to hear about just yet
2972656 what do you think you would devote yourself to if you chose the blues
2972657 on the condition that i not join the red ajah
2972658 would be to help men who can channel to improve their living conditions and help them live good lives while they were still sane
2972659 and help discredit the rumours about them and not make them seem like horrible monsters
2972660 you do know accepted that you are lucky you havent told any of the other sisters this even within the blue ajah no matter what you have heard of our dislike of what the reds stand for many believe that male channellers should be gentled it is a tradition and aes sedai do not like to go against tradition
2972661 a worthy cause however dangerous perhaps if the dragon is reborn in our lifetime you will be a part of that
2972662 the blues would be more than happy to have you among us
2972663 how would you keep the men safe how would you keep the world safe from the male channelers
2972664 i dont think the reds should take the men right away i believe they should let them live under close surveillance of course until they begin to go mad
2972665 when my father was taken he had not even begun to go mad yet he had only known for a few months that he could channel and there was no hint of the madness
2972666 id also like to try to look for a way to rid saidin of the taint its not fair that we should be free to use saidar while men cant touch saidin without risking madness
2972667 i have been sent on a chore by a yellow sister they need more herbs and i cannot collect them all myself so if youll follow me to the warders yard ill point them out to you so you can collect them
2972668 i have been sent on a chore by a yellow sister they need more herbs and i cannot collect them all myself so if youll follow me to the warders yard ill point them out to you so you can collect them

2972777 estel an accepted of the tower brought us to the yard to pick some herbs for her i see no herbs around but we must do as the accepted wish sir
2972778 the men came over to introduce themselves and things just happened
2972779 neither these men nor us women meant any harm it has just been
2972780 it was nice having some attention from some attractive men is all we did not mean to be disobedient master at arms
2972781 estel an accepted of the tower brought us to the yard to pick some herbs for her i see no herbs around but we must do as the accepted wish sir
2972782 the men came over to introduce themselves and things just happened

2972784 it was nice having some attention from some attractive men is all we did not mean to be disobedient master at arms
2972785 master at arms the novices did nothing beyond humouring our fumbling attempts to impress them we trainees interrupted their work and should be punished but they were merely following their instructions
2972786 any kissing was the result of gratitude for our assistance and amusement during an onerous chore allow them to complete their chore and return to the tower men should not interfere with the doings of aes sedai i will stay in their place taking whatever punishment you deem necessary
2972787 thats the master of arms i hear he has a mean streak worse than the mistress of novices
2972788 i am sorry i was a bit confused i think maybe you should better be going

2972794 this is how it will work and i want the truth and nothing but it from your lips or youll regret it
2972795 i was sent by a yellow sister to collect herb master at arms
2972796 i asked for these novices assistance i am disappointed that they would forsake their work to flirt with the trainees and they can expect retribution from the mistress of novices for their conduct
2972797 im glad you see that these fools should be punished
2972798 i hold you responsible for seeing to it that every single novice who you sent here reports to the mistress of novices immediately
2972799 if i even catch one glimpse of any of your faces in the warders yard again before you are raised to the shawl youll wish you were never born
2972800 as for you boys i want everyone who participated in this event to report to me in ten minutes with their body armour swords and shields on and in place

2972882 well i guess it was always in the back of my head that i would go blue though i never really acknowledged it until lately after spending an afternoon with serena blue is the only ajah where i can really fulfill what i came here to do and there have been other things ive learned here or finally realised that as a blue i can actually for things about
2972883 before i knew it i was a blue and now i know i dont belong anywhere else and i never have what cause do you plan to pursue if i may ask

2972886 now what to do about that man he simply cannot ruin our party
2972887 well i hope to abolish arranged marriages as i was to be the victim of one but managed to escape to the tower and i realise i led a very sheltered life before coming to the tower and i hope to enlighten those few nobles who believe the poor and downtrodden are victims of their own lack of aptitude

2972895 andular gaidin we are blessed by the light that you graced our bonding celebration with your presence

2972897 my lady thank you for this graceful dancing i fear you far outshine my humble attempts
2972898 the light shine on you and your warder aes sedai it is mere happenstance that i find myself here i was out for a drink and this fine inn caught my eye and so i came in for a drink

2972900 what are you discussing with one of my sisters gaidin
2972901 no throm the pleasure was mine i havent danced with a man since before i left saldaea you seem to have revived some of the flare i once had you and serena
2972902 i wish that initiates were allowed to dance more i really enjoyed myself
2972903 my lady it appears that it is well past the time i should have left this establishment perhaps you would like an escort back to the tower if you are ready to leave as well
2972904 my dear serena i do wish to extend my congratulations to you
2972905 what an interesting example of gaidin youve managed to acquire sister but then youth does have its advantages moderation not always being one of them im sure youll impress upon thera the responsibilities and demeanour a true gaidin displays
2972906 im rather surprised she did not learn from andulars example
2972907 come tia if id known she was here i would never have stopped in lets leave them to their celebration

2972962 employees are struggling to keep on top of to do lists and think the answer is to work harder eating a sandwich at their desk as opposed to taking a full lunch break and also not having sufficient breaks during the rest of the day
2972963 but these breaks are essential for staff to perform at their best and cope with the daily pressures of work managers should be encouraging staff to take lunch breaks their performance and ultimately the business may suffer otherwise
2972964 the vast majority of people are having lunch at their desk while working thats the average person now very rarely do they get out of the office
2972965 if senior management create a culture that lunch is for wimps its counterproductive we all need breaks
2972966 people feel they have to get to work early stay late and not take lunch breaks and i think its going to get worse because of job insecurity people will want to show more commitment and that means working through their lunch and staying late
2972967 although there are times when people have to work through they should try to get out two or three times a week for a good hour particularly in summer be brave because in the end you will be judged by your output not by your presenteeism
2972968 i definitely feel refreshed and mentally sharper when i come back if i dont get out at lunchtime the day just feels like one constant grind all the way through and i really like the way it breaks up the day

2973005 and well have to make further improvements in all areas to achieve what we want to however the past two years have instilled confidence within the team we met our goals in both 2006 and 2007 we are heading in the right direction and everybody in munich and hinwil is focused on the job in hand if we continue our progress along this path we will also fulfil our aims for 2008
2973006 it is generally very difficult to define expectations and make prognoses but i hope that our plan works out and we are able to win our first race in 2008
2973007 i expect us to move forward in all areas particularly as far as reliability is concerned and to learn from our mistakes this development process is essential in what were trying to achieve
2973008 i will also be looking to achieve greater consistency in my results during my second full season in formula one retirements and that crash in canada which also prevented me from starting in the usa cost me points in 2007 we all need to take further steps forward in 2008 and make maximum use of every opportunity that presents itself
2973009 in nick and robert we have a strong and evenly matched duo for our young team which in 2006 and 2007 had to drive forward its development in terms of structure and personnel alongside its world championship campaign consistency is also a great asset we know that these two drivers will get the maximum out of the machinery we give them the f1 07 was a good car so on this basis the f1 08 should be even better
2973010 the data which the f1 08 has delivered ahead of its roll out is extremely promising
2973011 the development work will continue at full speed up to the start of the new season indeed another aero package will be added to the f1 08 at the forthcoming test and this will also alter the external appearance of the car once again
2973012 the point is that you need to look at a college degree including a law school degree as an investment what will it cost and what will you get out of it look at the best way to maximize this investment and youll be able to find a school that meets your needs and wont leave you in a ton of debt relative to your income ignore these factors and select a school based on considerations like campus feel nearness to home the popularity of the football team one great professor and so on and you may be setting yourself up for a bad financial decision

2973014 non government actors in the mindanao peace process and worked hard at having a deep understaning of the ancestral domain issues and that various other factors that have hampered mindanao peace and development
2973015 the malaysian government had served as host and facilitator of the grp milf peace talks since 2001 and opposed an american presence at the negotiating table moros suspected usips presence motives and relationship with the u s government usip lacking a permanent base in mindanao also faced challenges in establishing strong channels of communication with the grp milf and civil society multiple changes in the composition of the grp negotiating team and divergent perspectives and agendas within the moro leadership and communities further complicated the peace facilitation effort at times senior grp officials lukewarm support for an equitable and effective peace agreement hampered the efforts of skilled and committed negotiators corruption and criminality among the moros exacerbated by centuries old clan loyalties created other hurdles
2973016 usip introduced concepts and approaches that were useful to both government and milf peace panels it helped inform the philippine population and elites in manila in particular of issues underlying the conflict in mindanao while presenting potentially viable means of resolving them the institutes efforts have added marginally to more balanced media coverage usip funding supported the publication of policy papers which were distributed to scholars analysts journalists and policymakers usip also sponsored educational materials for use in philippine schools
2973017 who is in charge of this vehicle called the peace process and why is it crucial to have a driver at the tactical level will there be a real permanent empowered team on the grp side that could pull off the job including selling the merits of a settlement on ancestral domain to the philippine congress the mindanao power brokers the corporations and so on at the strategic level who will marshal public support for a moro ancestral domain who will start and sustain a badly needed effort at national reconciliation the inclusion of the moro narrative into philippine national history and the overcoming of deep seated anti moro prejudice in the grp peace panel there is some interest in precedents elsewhere where the ruling regime has apologized to its oppressed minority for example in new zealand an apology to the moros from manila would probably vitiate moro resentment to a significant extent but it is too much to hope for from the government 3 who will show us the money who will fund the implementation of an ancestral domain agreement what resources will be used to compensate parties whose interests may be compromised by concessions to the moros on territory and resources who will fund the sustained training of moro administrative professionals and a moro technocratic cadre that can effectively manage and develop moro ancestral domain
2973018 support the ceasefire the ceasefire has been the single greatest success of the peace process but it remains fragile monitoring mechanisms on the ground need to be bolstered with training funds and other support as long as the ceasefire holds the parties can keep negotiating thorny issues and it is better for them to keep talking even if it takes years the problem is when shooting begins helping to support the ceasefire would be a relatively inexpensive endeavor for the u s but it could go a very long way in generating good will towards us and enhancing our credibility on peace in muslim mindanao such good will and credibility could eventually enhance our interest in combating terrorism we need good intelligence to be effective and people will talk to us only when we have earned their trust make available to the parties the best available practices and lessons from other countries that have resolved issues similar to ancestral domain with their own minorities the grp and milf for example have both expressed interest in the experiences of northern ireland new zealand with the maoris sudan and other countries make a generous offer of post agreement development assistance more than the 30 million offered previously it would not hurt now for us to work with the bangsamoro development agency bda it is a group run by competent individuals and they are focused on weeding out corruption early in the process of development training

2973139 im going to try to keep as much offense in there as we can german got on a streak a couple of weeks ago and was adding to the offensive attack he hasnt had too many hits recently but hopefully the bat will come back tony will get in there occasionally
2973140 now the whole world knows so i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2973141 in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2973142 i was pretty shocked when i heard about it because theres a lot of people that we know on that bus
2973143 so im thinking that could have been us and it made me realize that life is really short and precious and you never know when you know it might can happen to you

2973232 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2973233 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2973234 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2973235 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2973236 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else

2973238 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back

2973281 its a flying machine of human design a rather curious one i might add its a boat that flies
2973282 a human built this i thought their society had stagnated into a semi modern islander culture
2973283 it is true that their society has stagnated for the most part primarily due to our efforts to inhibit their growth but despite that hindrance there are still a few within their society that seem to excel
2973284 yes and i wish the director hadnt decided to do that to them humans seem to have such a dynamic potential to grow if left unhindered
2973285 well i may not agree with what the previous director has done but i do like the results he always wanted to see how the humans would progress technologically if certain restrictions were placed upon them while disappointing in some areas there are a few places in their society that seem to have excelled in such an environment
2973286 the specimen that flew this machine also created this intriguing wonder of design its simple but very fast and stable for a sail powered vessel of its size
2973287 its still at his home island we have not attempted to retrieve it yet for fear of being discovered it will be extracted when we feel it is safe to do so without discovery
2973288 how did it fly i dont see any engines did it have some kind of energy based drive system i dont see
2973289 nothing that advanced it used something the humans call a jet turbine engine
2973290 it is which is part of what makes this so fascinating not only was it powered by a jet turbine but the vessel had two of them of a design we have not seen from these specimens before
2973291 they apparently had a catastrophic failure during flight and were jettisoned by the pilot just a few clicks from land an observer crew in the area retrieved them for study shortly after they were ejected
2973292 actually that would be incorrect our records indicate that there was four people involved one of which was the pilot we captured shortly after his less than gracious landing on a lake in the middle of the western coast city of ipel the pilot who is now in observation block seventy four appears to have just been a friend of the creator he apparently was asked to pilot the craft because of his vast nautical and flight experience which would have been important given that this flying machine is also a boat
2973293 this was the mastermind of the entire project hes a member of a group they call the guide of scholars theyre a local organization that takes in all the greatest minds in the hundred isles and uses them for the betterment of their society
2973294 ive heard of them theyre an interesting group of humans so do we have any operational specifications on this flying machine
2973295 we do when the engines operated at full potential it could generate a speed of nearly four hundred of their miles in one hour unit of their time at level flight thats approximately two hundred clicks a cycle by our measurements
2973296 not really its capable of withstanding much greater speeds nearly three hundred clicks per cycle from what we can tell
2973297 then if it was so durable why did it suffer so much damage you said something about it having a less than graceful landing did something go wrong
2973298 as you can see he approaches the lake very awkwardly at this point doing all he can to reach the water without crashing he has already jettisoned the engines at this point and is traveling entirely on inertia we believe the loss of his engines adversely affected his flight stability hence his difficulty in controlling the aircraft watch as he comes out between the buildings here he appears to catch a low hanging cable here near the eastern shore as he tries to make his landing were not sure why that was there but as you can see it nearly tears off his tail section and sends the craft crashing into the water below it then hits and bounces into the air we feel that the pilot would have felt quite a jarring from this you can see right there where he makes his second contact see the craft strike and slow rapidly before bouncing into the air again
2973299 that must have been quote a ride was he hurt
2973300 surprisingly no he was wearing a helmet and the boat has some very well designed safety gear including a well cushioned seat any impact he would have felt would have been absorbed by that safety equipment the worst he would have suffered was a little nausea our field teams did report that he was a little shaken and slightly disoriented when they found him
2973301 the damage would have been much worse had it not been for its rather inventive design the extra strength they built into it paid off if nothing else it kept him alive
2973302 shes wounded repeatedly yet fights on with all her strength to the end this amazing little craft has a strong heart i like that in a ship
2973303 tell me how exactly did these four get around the restrictions of the central government to acquire the information necessary to build this machine i certainly cant see them having built it on their own without it
2973304 we dont know yet were still trying to ascertain that
2973305 what led this one the pilot to fly all the way out here
2973306 that im afraid is going to be somewhat hard to explain
2973307 apparently so eight of our biodrones are dead a large number are wounded an entire island has been burnt to the ground and some of the natives are now in a panic looking for the pilot and his friends
2973308 when he sent a message to the director that a new specimen was coming i did not expect all of this extra baggage to be attached to it
2973309 we only got the report a few moments earlier we couldnt have known
2973310 if he wasnt such an important asset to us on those islands id have had him brought back here immediately and court martialed on a charge of stupidity and arrogance
2973311 that may still happen the director is right now trying to decide the fate of the project there is a lot of evidence of scattered contamination of the society that may risk the integrity of the project plus recent political shifts within the united worlds might end our human observation project very soon were having enough of a problem keeping the location of this planet a secret from the human alliance as it is if they find out were holding over ten million humans captive here on this planet as specimens the ramifications could be extraordinary
2973312 im well aware of that but what bothers me is what well do if we have to terminate the project i couldnt bring myself to kill ten million sentient beings just to protect ourselves from the political backlash this would cause if our work were discovered the human alliance has the power to wipe us all from existence and the will to do it
2973313 he is in arboretum seven being observed by our field units theyre trying to acquaint him to the specimen complex
2973314 well then why dont we visit this keil and get to know him better
2973315 these are native to my homeland they are a symbol of friendship of the greatest kind between two of our people
2973316 wow a friendship like that must mean a lot then
2973317 it is the greatest honor among my people few are worthy of such an honor and none breach it all who have sworn friendship by this flower have forsaken all in honor of that oath
2973318 what a curious power this boy has to silence the greatest of rivals with a simple look amazing i must see more
2973319 yied i know you and saydum dont get along i dont know if theres anything that can be done about that but lets forget about that and try to be friends ok were apparently all in the same boat together so we may as well make the most of it
2973320 indeed he is i havent seen a human specimen quite like him since miguigua nearly three thousand years ago
2973321 a fine specimen he is but a miguigua he is not he still has far to go before he reaches the level of the great miguigua human specimen zero zero one
2973322 but some day he might till then let us continue to observe
2973323 that was a remote control for a jamming device ive had installed in this room it keeps people outside from hearing whats going on inside
2973324 i will at some point but first let me explain the purpose of this meeting i have brought you here because you have now become a very important part of my plan for freeing the people of the hundred isles from their prison
2973325 not to sound obtuse sir but what prison are you talking about arent we already free
2973326 what are you talking about youre speaking my language which i must say you are speaking with greater fluidity than you ever have before
2973327 how is that possible very few humans know my language
2973328 patience and i will explain all to you but first i must warn you that what you learn here is not to be spoken of beyond this room until the appointed time
2973329 mitch you are here because you will be a representative for us to your people during this time the outcome affects you just as much as it affects our people
2973330 what is this amazing marvel before us how is such a thing possible
2973331 please let us stay focused if i spent all my time explaining this seemingly alien technology to you we will be here all day so for now please hold your questions they will be answered in due order now master verberos please explain all you know
2973332 master barnia forgive me for intruding but i am unfamiliar with this man who is he
2973333 he is my vice commander and the second highest member in the guild of scholars he is the sole person responsible for all covert information gathering within the guild
2973334 if any secrets or information needs to be acquired it is his job to acquire them by any means necessary and then bring them to me this also includes covert spying and observation of all government officials within the hundred isles i like to be informed about everything that is happening in the islands and master verberos and his network of operatives and researchers provide that information
2973335 ah fascinating please proceed i am more curious than ever about what he has to share with us
2973336 this picture you see in front of you is a map of our islands one hundred and six islands covering a landmass of three hundred sixty one thousand square miles with a population of just over ten million people the majority of which populate just sixty three of those islands the remaining islands are either agricultural resource or abandoned
2973337 these are our current boundaries artificial barriers which we cannot cross sager you live on a fishing island this should be quite familiar to you
2973338 the safe fishing zone and the barrier beyond which are the great black fish
2973339 this is the planet we currently call home it is a specimen world far from our true native homeworld
2973340 like bacteria on a slide we are being observed by a much more advanced species for as yet unknown reasons but unlike a slide and microscope our observation is being done on a much larger scale we currently live on a planet that our captors call a biospec it is a world used for studying and observing various alien species from across the galaxy in one central location we are one of those species there are currently forty three known species being observed on this world two of which exist on this island namely we humans and our friends the bard hawks our ancestors were human just like we are but unlike us they were born on a planet called earth
2973341 this is our home system or at least it was the home of our ancestors nearly three thousand years ago from what information i could acquire our ancestors were transplanted from a remote island on earth and brought here to be observed since that time humanity on earth has grown evolved matured separated and finally united to form a society that has colonized and conquered nearly a third of our galaxy
2973342 master verberos i do not wish to be rude but may i ask a question
2973343 if we are human and we were taken from the rest of our people why havent they come to find us yet
2973344 its a piece of very advanced technology i was able to lift from our captors through somewhat less than honorable means this room is full of technology like this this includes the language translator which allows mitch to understand our language and we his language
2973345 for now no but they are beginning to become suspicious
2973346 if this is true why do we need to keep this information secret shouldnt we just take our chances and tell everyone or at the least make contact with our captors wouldnt they be pleased to know that weve advanced far enough to detect their presence
2973347 that would be a bad idea for now the less our people know the better you yourselves were awestruck and dumbfounded just at the presentation of this simple bit of technology and information yet since you are well educated and well read the shock of it for you was far less than it would be for someone who does not enjoy the same education as yourself such a revelation is still within your capability to comprehend regardless of how alien it is but im afraid that the rest of the citizens of the hundred isles are not ready for such information to go from being masters of their own world to captive specimens at the hands of a manipulative unseen master with unimaginable technology is more than most could handle it would incite panic and utterly destroy or at the very least severely damage our society in irreparable ways there is also the risk that such a revelation would bring down the wrath of our captors upon us spoiled specimens are of no use to them that is why this information must remain between us if the discovery of our knowledge is inevitable i would rather they focus their anger on us rather than our people it may be that our folly will lead to our own deaths but i would rather have this death than to remain a prisoner and specimen for the rest of my life
2973348 freedom has been my creed since i was hatched ive lived as though free my whole life and if i must risk my life to gain true freedom then you have my service until life departs from me
2973349 thank you for your valiant offer but hopefully our efforts wont come to that you will first need to convince the rest of your fellow hawks that we will require their assistance to meet our goals
2973350 i will do all that is in my power to achieve that
2973351 count me in if keil is now a prisoner of these aliens i want to help you in any way i can to free him my friends as well if youll have them
2973352 we wont need your friends just yet but their cooperation may be needed at some point so be diligent in acquiring their assistance but keep all that you have learned here a secret until otherwise instructed

2973371 over the past year we have driven process improvements across the organization and today we are announcing the difficult but necessary measures that accompany this type of transformation our ultimate goal is to build a high performance efficient and simple organization within a cost structure that allows us to compete and win effectively against any competitor in the world
2973372 i recognize the impact this will have on affected employees due to the careful planning that has taken place these reductions will occur through an orderly and considered process similar to last years restructuring we will maximize normal attrition and will work to re deploy affected employees to other opportunities within the company whenever appropriate i am pleased to report that in 2007 approximately 30 of the employees in affected positions were redeployed or transferred to other roles in the company
2973373 we will promote and prominently display blu ray software and hardware products

2973380 following a disciplinary hearing after a detailed investigation the senior manager whose hospital laptop computer was stolen has been dismissed from the trust with immediate effect
2973381 the unanimous decision of the disciplinary panel sends out a clear statement about how seriously the trust takes security and patient confidentiality i again apologise for the distress the theft of this laptop may have caused
2973382 we will be engaging an external consultancy to carry out an independent assessment of the trusts procedures and protocols on data security

2973394 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups

2973397 the national human papilloma virus register is an important part of the fight against cervical cancer which will help remind girls and women when they need vaccine updates and collect data on the programs effectiveness
2973398 we have a childhood immunisation register that records immunisations for children up to age seven and the national hpv register will now go forward into adulthood for that particular immunisation
2973399 we must consider going even further with efficient and cost effective use of funds to establish a complete national whole of life register of all immunisations for all australians
2973400 there is real patient benefit in a properly administered register
2973401 it would be convenient for patients and doctors and ensure that patients were up to date and covered with immunisations as well as reducing unnecessary duplication of vaccinations
2973402 for example there is no national record of whos received mmr or hepatitis b shots at school and who might need to receive them later in life
2973403 for doctors a national whole of life register would provide total data to complement their patient records and for patients they would know that wherever and whenever in australia they have had an immunisation it would be recorded
2973404 this is an issue of considerable importance to the health of all australians and to the governments overall prevention agenda

2973407 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2973408 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2973409 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2973410 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
2973411 we are excited about tomodirect because it will greatly increase the overall flexibility and efficiency of the hi art treatment system
2973412 along with helical tomotherapy delivery tomodirect will enhance our customers revenue generating opportunities and strengthen their ability to deliver the highest quality radiation therapy to the broadest patient population
2973413 tomodirect will expand the spectrum of external beam radiation therapy patients who can be optimally treated with tomotherapy s unique image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy ig imrt now we will have an option to deliver dose via two unique and complementary delivery modes choosing whichever provides the optimal dose distribution clearly breast cancer patients will benefit from tomodirect and other disease sites will likely be developed for which there is clinical benefit
2973414 certainly with the combination of helical and direct deliveries tomotherapy should offer significant benefit for a majority of breast cancer treatments it will provide the ability to choose and apply the right modality for the best treatment our research is focused on providing comprehensive usage guidelines as we study and validate this new mode combination
2973415 tomodirect will use all the power of the platform that makes helical tomotherapy the gold standard in radiation therapy
2973416 the difference is that we expect treatment planning times will be dramatically reduced due to the much smaller number of beam directions used furthermore for certain geometries the ability to use only the most beneficial angles will cut delivery times significantly with tomodirect routine cases can now be planned in under 10 minutes and importantly users can deliver from up to 12 discrete angles with a single turn of the key
2973417 tomotherapy has already been embraced for its superior treatment quality especially for complex cases the introduction of tomodirect will fully open the door for the hi art system to have a significant presence in all settings from large academic centers to single linac centers where high patient throughput is paramount tomodirect will effectively increase our access to a larger percentage of the radiation therapy market opportunities

2973425 i knew there was a chance at getting matos at the start and i pulled that off and was able to hang on i still had to fight off some really strong competition but luckily we were strong enough to stay in the lead and take the win
2973426 it feels good to make up some ground in the standings after the last few races
2973427 we still have three races to make up points we are due for a strong showing on a road course and after that is another oval so i feel good about our chances to make up some good points

2973429 married people are better off than unmarried people in terms of health status but the gap has narrowed over time
2973430 data cannot tell us definitively if marriage is the cause of the change in self reported health or some other unobserved factor
2973431 given the rise in cohabitation over the time period they study and the lack of evidence on how cohabiting affects health relative to marriage since cohabiting is generally less stable and shorter term means that we miss an interesting piece of the puzzle
2973432 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003

2973435 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2973436 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2973437 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2973438 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2973439 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2973440 our lawyer made us change the name of this song so we wouldnt get sued

2973443 im like a lawyer with the way im always trying to get you off me amp you
2973444 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2973445 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2973446 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2973447 we have cleared two of the three tracks and are clearing the long distance trains which were delayed after the blockage of tracks

2973469 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2973470 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2973471 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation

2973483 i didnt see the rehearsal but i was aware that the torch bearer would run around the top of the stadium before finally lighting the olympic flame i had no idea how it was going to look but it turned out well from my position
2973484 a lot of luck is needed if li ning had lit the flame in a different spot i would have missed it completely i chose a long lens for this section of the ceremony and it paid off the projection of colour that followed the flame around the stadium really made this picture
2973485 i shot all aspects of the ceremony from the drummers at the start to the fireworks at the end and of course the teams entering the stadium
2973486 fireworks always make for great pictures but looking back at the ceremony the lighting of the flame was the highlight four years on from athens and the olympic torch finally reached its destination at the beijing olympic games

2973514 they see that citizens need help and they risk their own lives to go in and try to help them
2973515 well one of the dangers of course is time of day
2973516 time of day people are sleeping thank god we did have some smoke detectors working in these structures so time of day and the closeness of the buildings so we had exposure problems
2973517 weve had a lot of cosmetics work going on weve also got new equipment like white boards and money is being spent on new text books in the science department
2973518 my family if safe we are all in the capital the airports of tbilisi were bombed three times but fortunately without serious results
2973519 we are really in serious troubles the russian tanks are coming to the whole territory of georgia from all sides there were a lot of air attacks during the two last days also no idea what will be the future of my country even if the usa will decide to help georgia by its military forces there would be the end of the country it could become the land of the war of two empires
2973520 south ossetian autonomous republic was established by the ussr on the territory of georgia in 1921 georgians and ossetians lived there together but georgians were in absolute majority there when the ussr collapsed the government of the south ossetia declared the independence and stated its desire to join russia but of course georgian population and the government of the country refused the wide escalation started then and it was the severe war there in early 90th but georgia loose the war as russian military forces went to the country and supported minority we had a lot of georgian refugees from the region which gained the status quo but stayed as a non recognized republic until now there never been the peace in the region during the years but the situation tensed last weeks when the massive shootings from both sides took place because city tskinvali the center of the region was circled by georgian villages do not ask me now who started according to the peace journalism theory journalist never should ask this question and i really dont know because there is no one truth in such situations then the government of georgia started a special operation aiming to restore the territorial integrity of the state and to let the refugees come back to their homes but as it was expected russia immediately reacted and started bombing whole georgia i was just informed that the georgian side just announced officially that the country is ready to fulfill russias ultimatum and to leave the territory of the conflict region lets see whether it would be enough to stop intervention we are really expecting everything as fighting with this empire georgia got a very sad experience during two centuries unfortunately there are a lot of victims from the both sides and a huge material damage for the small country
2973521 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2973522 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan

2973528 mccain and obama seem like funny guys so why are their campaigns anything but
2973529 currently we lose most people in cardiac arrest because they cannot survive or cannot survive without brain damage long enough to be defibrillated when someone is in cardiac arrest he or she needs prompt resuscitation by someone trained in cpr using chest compression that is the only thing that will keep a patient alive long enough for the paramedics to arrive and defibrillate the heart the window of opportunity is tiny only five to seven minutes to defibrillate before brain damage occurs unless successful cpr is done that is why less than 5 of those in cardiac arrest survive outside a hospital
2973530 our summer learning programme has been a fantastic opportunity for young people in the area giving them experience and allowing them to see what the college has to offer

2973534 last year it hurt us when donnie didnt practice and then tried to play it was the same thing the week d j johnson missed because his dad passed away thats a very emotional and personal thing but without the preparation he wasnt ready to play
2973535 you watch him work right now trying to get back and theres no questioning his commitment
2973536 we just have to find a way to keep him on the field
2973537 he played a good game in chicago really showed his abilities
2973538 hes intelligent hes athletic and hes tough there have been times in practice where ive called out nice play d j only to look closer and see it was pat thomas who made the play
2973539 we are giving him a chance to do some things he never had the chance to do down in atlanta
2973540 i think hes just tired of me yelling at him
2973541 we had questions about their toughness and some of those have been answered

2973549 a military jury on wednesday found a former driver for osama bin laden guilty of supporting terrorism but not of conspiring in terrorist attacks handing the bush administration a partial victory in the first u s war crimes trial in a half a century
2973550 at sentencing hearings that began on wednesday afternoon the navy officer presiding over the case keith allred rejected a request by the prosecution to call an fbi agent to describe the effects of the attacks of september 11 2001
2973551 allred said hamdan was such a small player that it would be unfair to have the jury hear the testimony as it would imply hamdan had a role in the 9 11 attacks
2973552 despite the potential for a sentence less than or equal to the time he already has served hamdan has been told by his lawyers of the bush administrations intent to keep all branded enemy combatants detained indefinitely regardless of any acquittals
2973553 the bush administration needed a big win in the salim hamdan case at guant namo
2973554 i would be very surprised if any of this conviction stands at the end of the day says scott horton a law professor specializing in human rights at columbia university he was convicted of things that are not war crimes by a tribunal that has the power only to prosecute war crimes
2973555 t he hamdan verdict points up more than anything else one of the central mistakes of the bush administration after 9 11 sheer overreaching
2973556 what began as a hunt for a relatively contained group of self declared murderers like bin laden became a feckless dragnet for tens of thousands if one includes iraq that no other country could openly support
2973557 by defining the war on terror so expansively the administration has undermined the legitimacy of that very concept says matt waxman the former defense department assistant secretary of detainee affairs who fought several brave battles within the white house principally against cheney his chief legal counsel david addington and their justice department mole john yoo to clarify and rationalize detention and interrogation rules
2973558 on wednesday after 6 1 2 years of controversy and delay the administration finally scored a victory in a military commission trial at guantanamo bay cuba gaining the conviction of one terrorist mastermind

2973560 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2973561 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2973562 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2973563 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
2973564 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2973565 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2973566 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2973567 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2973568 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
2973569 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
2973570 there is a lot on the line at the olympic games you spend four years preparing for six seconds in the circle
2973571 i needed to see the film to make sure it was a foul it was right and i apologised temporary moments of insanity are ok
2973572 a gold medal is the ultimate validation of an athletics career in our sport and hearing the national anthem played in my name would be more powerful than the medal itself
2973573 but if i dont win it then its not going to change the way i look back on my career you dont do this for the medals and people who do are not usually that successful
2973574 if i perform to the best of my ability then i have achieved my goal if that gets me silver then thats fine with me if someone throws 22 something and beats me i can live with that its when i dont perform and lose when i get annoyed and frustrated
2973575 we know we are the best in the world and expect to do well
2973576 weve had chances to do that in recent olympic games and world championships and its eluded us we are all ready for some big performances we just need to go and execute

2973602 i dont think that in 20 years i ever saw him mad
2973603 you could always go to him with anything and he would always listen

2973611 construction midcap capital goods have just started moving the cool down in crude and commodities really first impacted banks and the oil stocks now it is filtering through and you could have stocks like jp associates going back up to rs 240 245 punj lloyd going up to rs 380 390 again idfc could be headed up to rs 130 132 so really now this commodity cool off the impact on construction stocks things like hindustan construction that can go up to rs 135 136 so those kinds of midcap bets would do well as long as the market is able to maintain broadly the 4 400 4 500 sorts of levels
2973612 it is on record that he okiro was promoted from commissioner of police cp to deputy inspector general dig without ever being an assistant inspector general aig even his confirmation as ig bypassed ogbonnaya onovo who was senior to him
2973613 beyond this however we have other issues to take up with the police service commission we are alarmed that about 40 of the demoted officers compared to nine from the north come from the south west zone which means they are all yoruba we want to be convinced that this is not another continuation of geographical manipulations to ensure that a certain ethnic stock continues to take all the sensitive positions in the force now and in the future
2973614 i will say without prejudice that there is certainly no comparison between the present igps rapid promotion then and that of ribadu
2973615 however if policemen confronts robbers in the bank and they robbers kill some of them while the rest showed gallantry by confronting the robbers after which they succeeded in either killing or arresting them this is gallantry
2973616 they sent him here and he is more than half way through his programme so what do we do this is the first time we are facing this kind of situation i am waiting for instruction from above i dont think it is wise for us to say anything on the issue more so that police authorities have not briefed us on the demotion since we read it in the newspapers we cannot just tell him to go away on that basis we are waiting for a directive from above and until we hear from there we cannot do anything
2973617 how can you say that a man who won the inspector general of police award thrice in row long before he was appointed the efcc boss did not deserve accelerated promotion this man was awarded the inspector general of the federation award before he was appointed the boss of the efcc this man won some landmark cases that are cited in courts today before he was appointed the efcc when he got to the efcc no matter what anybody says he did not do a bad job and they are saying that he did not deserve accelerated promotion who then deserves this promotion
2973618 what happened between december when the president persuaded ribadu to go to kuru for the programme and now that the world seems to be falling apart for the man apart from the so called fast track promotion why are the security agencies chasing the man
2973619 all grey areas connected with the cases have been cleared
2973620 for security reasons i will not tell you when this will happen or about the time it will happen but i can tell you it is sooner than anyone can imagine because the commission has too many cases to look into and cannot afford to procrastinate its a new era and new things will be inevitable
2973621 its a question of just going back to them and this time treat them meticulously
2973622 this is a new efcc and we do not want to inherit any stigma from any quarters there would be no sacred cows the issue of selective justice does not apply to us because if you have cases to answer the efcc will not look the other way but if you dont we certainly have no business with you
2973623 the black august hip hop project has been a great way to communicate the importance of supporting political prisoners in the u
2973624 it has cleaned up some of the negativity associated with hip hop and shows that we are self determined and self sufficient
2973625 the state has suffered serious set back in the past in term of development and the present administration is trying to bridge the gap
2973626 there is a disconnect within pdp and that the earlier the party put its house in order the better for it
2973627 the comments by his excellency former vice president atiku abubakar on this issue have been misinterpreted to mean he could be considering returning to the pdp but nothing could be farther from the truth than that insinuation
2973628 his statement atiku was unambiguous that if the pdp could succeed in instituting internal democracy within its ranks it will have a salutary effect not only on the party but also on governance and on the countrys democracy especially the electoral process
2973629 the act the decree setting it up in 1990 gave them these incentives namely tax freedom free trade zone and so many things
2973630 they the operators know the issues that because of these incentives they have not been able to pay certain royalties certain taxes that should come to the country and if you quantify them it comes to a lot of money and again part of the incentives is to sell the gas to them at a give away price
2973631 but at the moment there is only one functional lng in nigeria which is the bonny lng and unarguably it is the largest lng in the world it is an lng that is less than 10 years that is moving to train seven now they have perfected train six and they are moving to train seven
2973632 other countries can boast of one train or two trains within a period of ten years
2973633 how are we feeling the impact of this money from lng as a nation before they move to train seven so the senate will not support train seven of bonny lng we will not support it until a proper account of trains one to six is given to the nigerian people so we advise them to render proper account to the nnpc
2973634 there are certain aspects of the act setting up the lng that have to be amended when this thing was done ten years ago they were given all manner of incentives so that they could come into the business
2973635 but today those incentives can no longer stand the test of time much as they have ten years to run we will like to find out whether those incentives are supposed to cover trains one or two
2973636 they have carried on up to where they are today and these incentives if you open them up critically are like dashing these people this gas and getting no money out of it for a country that is greatly blessed in gas resources like nigeria so with respect to nigeria lng in bonny the act must be amended to reflect the current global realities
2973637 we expect them nnpc to brief the senate now on the economic viability of olokola lng
2973638 we will work round to reduce the cost of that plant
2973639 i have observed that the current cost of that plant will not stand the test of time and there is an agreement currently to reduce that plant by 30 per cent that has not been done and it has to be done
2973640 why will it be a free trade zone and what are their plans assuming that the federal government does not grant the free trade zone
2973641 we are still dealing with the matter of brass lng and there are still some very major issues about local content involving the indigenes in what they are doing
2973642 so there are certain issues about brass and we are yet to look at their final investment decisions fids weve not seen their fids weve not seen their gas sales agreement gsa because for an nlg to take off you must sell the gas ahead of time
2973643 we sold this gas 29 years ahead of time so we must see the gas sales agreement because it is something you are selling 20 years ahead of time so if you dont get it right now it means that you have injured yourself for the next 20 years
2973644 it is not after sometime now we will start having the same problem we are having with this lng to say that we will give them incentives for 10 years so we shouldnt amend it
2973645 therefore we need to know what they are going in fact we are going to reject let me put it bluntly we are going to reject any further incentives to any of the emerging lngs
2973646 the federal government of nigeria has concluded arrangements to ensure that all domestic operations from the murtala mohammed international airport in lagos cease definitively and effectively at 12 00 midnight on monday 11th august 2008 it has accordingly advised all intending domestic air passengers to use only the domestic airport terminals
2973647 it will be recalled that the federal government had last monday 4th august 2008 given virgin nigeria airways ltd the only airline still operating domestic flight from the international airport a 7 day final relocation notice which expires at midnight on monday 11th august 2008
2973648 the federal government hereby appeals for the understanding and cooperation of all intending domestic passengers to ensure the smooth conclusion of this exercise
2973649 this is indeed a commendable gesture by the eko club international and i am really happy with this partnership which i wish to recommend to all other club and organisations i wish to recall that we partnered with the club lat year and we are here again this year as a matter of fact they have been to lagos island gbagada and presently they are here at ikosi isheri when they leave here they are heading to ikorodu
2973650 when we come together we can stand up against any other person and when we talk with one voice others will talk twice about trying to devise what separates us and when we are united we can face challenges that face our ummah talking about children out of schools because the parents cannot pay school fees so many of them who graduated are on the streets without job
2973651 we believe the development of muslim ummah anywhere in this country is the development of the totality of muslim ummah in the world therefore we support you totally and we want you to continue to close rank and call on our political leaders and ask them questions on what they have done with the mandate given to them

2973656 facua espera una sanci n ejemplarizante por parte de las autoridades competentes y lamenta el desprecio de ryanair hacia los derechos de los usuarios y la legislaci n vigente
2973657 por razones que no incumben de forma alguna a los pasajeros ni est n legitimadas por la ley
2973658 desde el momento en el que una compa a a rea emite el t tulo de transporte independiente de quien haya sido el intermediario existe una obligaci n contractual entre el transportista y el pasajero
2973659 facua duda si el motivo por el que la aerol nea ha cancelado las reservas a trav s de las agencias es que stas cometen irregularidades como asegura ryanair o que le est n suponiendo la p rdida de negocios como por ejemplo la contrataci n de seguros que aparecen preseleccionados al comprar billetes en su p gina web sin aclarar que son opcionales una pr ctica que motiv las denuncias de facua el pasado enero contra ryanair y otras ocho aerol neas y agencias

2973662 yeah we drop back to taking the i mutex in teh case where we are writing beyond eof or we have cached pages
2973663 previously we were milking high pin holsteins three times daily producing 9200 litres a cow
2973664 therefore we decided to use a four way cross to introduce some hybrid vigour and then put up a new shed rotary parlour and tracks linking the 45 new paddocks
2973665 two bulls are used from each breed a legs and feet improver bull and an udder improver hybrid vigour has also been created by cross breeding resulting in a 6 production increase and at least a 10 rise in health from hybrid vigour now cows are living longer mastitis levels have reduced and cows are getting back in calf quicker
2973666 two people check cows four times a day for 20 minutes each time all heifers are synchronised and served to dairy semen and run with angus bulls a basic recording system has been important in recording the cow date when served and lameness and mastitis levels
2973667 this year milk yields have been down due to poor grass growth so higher levels of concentrates are being fed three feeds a paddock is the optimum and all cows are housed in one group not only for efficiency of labour but also to promote better grass growth
2973668 it is also important when to decide to shut up grass at the end of the season you should be looking to have 2 3in left
2973669 the aim is to milk 480 cows in under 2 5 hours in the morning and even quicker in the afternoon this includes fore stripping
2973670 i dont think youve seen the same pace of innovation from microsoft as you have from sony recently

2973672 we have a really good relationship with sony and its great to see the evolution of the platform i think its experienced a lot of evolution and in some places playstation 3 is definitely beating out xbox

2973687 we try to do our job we try to concentrate on the next match ive tried to give them less time to think about todd bachmans death we have to collect our energy again and concentrate on our next three matches
2973688 were now looking forward to our next game against venezuela a team that we will beat
2973689 jason swam one of the fastest relays of all time his last 50 meters were absolutely incredible
2973690 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
2973691 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2973692 i had more adrenaline going than ive ever had in my life
2973693 its an unreal feeling because ive been part of the last two olympic relays that we came in silver and bronze in 2000 and 2004 and america has a great tradition of winning that relay we were the favorites both of those years and this year we were actually considered the underdog i still cant believe we all did as well as we did
2973694 then i changed and said its ridiculous this is the olympics
2973695 i got like super charged and took it from there
2973696 i jumped into the air and almost fell into the pool
2973697 i was really nervous that maybe i had messed up and didnt swim fast enough but jason said it best that we were one unit
2973698 there was a little bit of disappointment because it was so close
2973699 but i got a bronze medal yesterday and a silver today if i keep climbing up like this im going to be happy
2973700 obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of hurt my confidence at little bit
2973701 i felt good going into this race everybody brought their a game and swam really well its a true testament to how well beijing has done with its pool to allow the athletes to perform at their peak
2973702 i think this will be one of the races that hell never forget for the rest of his life
2973703 i saw a little twinkle in his eye he was a little more excited about this one
2973704 i knew it was going to come down to the end and i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope
2973705 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that 24 56 seconds for the last 50
2973706 i cant even explain it it was unreal ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to be beat in that relay
2973707 i knew that i wasnt at my sharpest i wasnt at my best
2973708 but you cant think about it you cant dwell on it you just have to go after it and i went for it
2973709 i kept it in broken english so he could understand it
2973710 i just said congratulations man thats an awesome swim and i know that if i had done that in front of him he would have done the exact same thing you got to take your hat off when somebody goes 58 9 in the olympic final
2973711 its just been a really tough year for me obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials effects your confidence a little bit
2973712 vermilion has so far proved to be a big success and it is something i am very very proud to have created in east manchester

2973714 il ny a rien de fondamental les investisseurs reviennent sur des dossiers qui avaient t massacr s ces derniers mois
2973715 favorable and confident expectation a forward look with assurance it has to do with the unseen and the future
2973716 confident expectation based on solid certainty biblical hope rests on gods promises particularly those pertaining to christs return so certain is the future of the redeemed that the nt sometimes speaks of future events in the past tense as though they were already accomplished hope is never inferior to faith but is an extension of faith faith is the present possession of grace hope is the confidence in graces future accomplishment
2973717 for i know that my redeemer lives and he shall stand at last on the earth and after my skin is destroyed this i know that in my flesh i shall see god whom i shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold and not another
2973718 blessed is the man who trusts in the lord and whose hope is the lord for he is like a tree planted by the waters which spreads out its roots by the river and will not fear when heat comes but its leaf will be green and will not be anxious in the year of drought nor will cease from yielding fruit

2973720 softball is growing in countries that didnt even have a program before
2973721 i think the games in good shape its incumbent upon softball to give the international olympic committee that information
2973722 the games should have sports that are clean and have the best athletes at the games in the case of baseball and had sic a universal appeal in the case of softball
2973723 this was its chance to expose the sport around the world and major league baseball just lost it softball paid the price for being a sister sport to baseball

2973790 no power in the world can stop a truth whose time has come
2973791 no power in the world can promote a truth whose time has not yet arrived
2973792 truth in both form and substance and my audience consists of those who have the courage to believe in and live the truth
2973793 no matter to what lengths we humans may go to obfuscate facts or delude our fellows truth has a way of squeeezing out through the cracks eventually

2973809 the alternative and this is the last possible and only sensible policy is not to try to prohibit or put the lock on the development of capitalism but to try and direct it into state capitalism
2973810 can the soviet state the dictatorship of the proletariat be combined united with state capitalism

2973816 the state of the monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth kings are justly called gods for they exercise a manner or resemblance of divine power on earth god has power to create or destroy make or unmake at his pleasure to give life or send death to judge all and to be judged nor accountable to none to raise low things and to make high things low at his pleasure and the like power have kings they make and unmake their subjects they have power of raising and casting down of life and of death judges over all their subjects and in all causes and yet accountable to none but god only i conclude then this point touching the power of kings with this axiom of divinity that as to dispute what god may do is blasphemy so is it sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power

2973829 that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes a justifier of the most appalling barbarity a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds and a dark shelter under which the darkest foulest grossest and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection were i to be again reduced to the chains of slavery next to that enslavement i should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me for of all slaveholders with whom i have ever met religious slaveholders are the worst i have ever found them the meanest and basest the most cruel and cowardly of all others it was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder but to live in a community of such religionists

2973853 a part of our history that is swept under the rug by many black historians glossed over or conveniently ignored
2973854 t he official u s census of 1830 shows that there were 3 775 free blacks who owned 12 740 black slaves
2973855 that year the average wealth of southern white men was 3 978

2973857 the volunteer system long since exhausted the spontaneously patriotic and warlike spirit of the community when volunteering for the love of the cause came to an end the bounty system was brought into requisition and money considerations induced tens of thousands to enlist who otherwise would not have done so but the charge on national and municipal credit of keeping up a vast army by bounties was too great to be borne the government has at last resorted to the means that all great military nations employ to raise and sustain armies
2973858 is that of general impartial conscription instead of the conscription being a hardship ungenerously imposed by the government upon the people it is really an arrangement of reverse character by which the government remits to a majority of its citizens a duty which it might rightfully call on all to discharge and remits according to a plan that the minority who have to serve cannot complain of as unfair for all run an equal risk of conscription

2973860 by the time the names of the first 1 236 draftees were drawn in new york city on july 11 reports about the carnage of gettysburg had been published in city papers
2973861 before the 1840s new york citys blacks held most of the low paid city jobs as longshoremen hod carriers brick makers barbers waiters and domestic servants
2973862 irish immigrants particularly those arriving after 1846 competed with blacks for these unskilled jobs and eventually gained control of the occupations leaving many blacks to work only as strike breakers
2973863 by 1860 one of every four of new york citys 800 000 residents was an irish born immigrant
2973864 competition for jobs between irish and black workers already intense before the war increased dramatically in the conflicts early years and racial tensions mounted in work places and in workingclass neighborhoods throughout the city
2973865 as a result the standard of living for the cities poorest immigrant groups the largest being the irish was drastically reduced
2973866 negroes had been brought in by the shipping companies of new york to break the strikes of longshoremen for higher wages in the spring of 1863
2973867 portrayed the irish as having bestial ape like or demonic features and the irishman especially the political radical was invariably given a long or prognathous jaw the stigmata to the phrenologists of a lower evolutionary order degeneracy or criminality

2973870 in lower manhatan rioters attacked and set fire to horace greeleys the citys most pro republican newspaper

2973872 several thousand men women and children armed with clubs brick bats etc advanced upon
2973873 the crowd took as much of the bedding clothing food and other transportable articles as they could and set fire to the building which firefighters were unable to save
2973874 the longshoremens association a white labor union patrolled the piers during the riots insisting that the colored people must and shall be driven to other parts of industry but other parts of industry such as cartmen and hack drivers not to mention skilled artisans also sought to exclude black workers the riots gave all these workers license to physically remove blacks not only from worksites but also from neighborhoods and liesure spaces
2973875 in the streets would call forth a halloo as when a fox breaks cover and away would dash a half a dozen men in pursuit sometimes a whole crowd streamed after with shouts and curses that struck deadly terror in the heart of the fugitive if overtaken he was pounded to death at once old men any young children too young to comprehend what it all meant were cruelly beaten and killed
2973876 rioters made a sport of mutilating black mens bodies sometimes sexually a group of white men and boys mortally attacked black sailor william williams jumping on his chest plunging a knife into him smashing his body with stones while a crowd of men women and children watched none intervened and when the mob was done with williams they cheered pledging vengeance on every nigger in new york a white laborer rousted coachman abraham franklin from his apartment and dragged him through the streets a crowd gathered and hanged franklin from a lampost as they cheered for jefferson davis the confederate president after the mob pulled franklins body from the lamppost a sixteen year old irish man patrick butler dragged the body through the streets by the genitals
2973877 when a mob threatened black drugstore owner philip white in his store at the corner of gold and frankfurt street his irish neighbors drove the mob away for he had often extended them credit and when rioters invaded harts alley and became trapped at the dead end the black and white residents of the alley together leaned out of their windows and poured hot starch on them driving them from the neighborhood but such incidents were few compared to the widespread hatred expressed curing and after the riots
2973878 whites who supported blacks were also targets of the violence they were beaten and their homes were destroyed blacks were forced to leave their homes because landlords were afraid that their buildings would be destroyed businesses that served blacks were also destroyed

2973883 1 042 drafted men had provided substitutes forty nine men had paid the exemption fee and only two had actually joined the union army
2973884 its super exciting because well pass just about 50 kilometers 30 miles from the surface and fly into the plume at the south pole

2974133 in order to attend to every raid which is our goal were going to need to have a lot of contributions
2974134 weve also received over 175 000 in requests for bond releases across the country
2974135 we need to raise 300 000 to 500 000 a month just to begin to meet the demand this effort needs a crisis response
2974136 we certainly dont have any problem with private efforts to make sure that illegal immigrants have fair hearings
2974137 but we think that the money would be spent more in the national interest if it were used to assist illegal immigrants involuntarily returning to their homelands

2974157 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2974158 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president
2974159 hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2974160 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished

2974167 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2974168 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2974169 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2974170 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2974171 world politics would be very different today were it not for winston churchill

2974175 with the help of another indian charity the association arranged for the air tickets of the three victims who were sent back to their homeland
2974176 we are still waiting for the seven other victims to show up at the association for help but we do not know their whereabouts they must be truly suffering
2974177 we are ready to handle the cases of the remaining victims and send them back home once they appear
2974178 we are ready to investigate and report back to our fellow indians as soon as possible to avoid them falling victim to these agents

2974208 i wish i could simply wave a magic wand and lower gas prices tomorrow id do that unfortunately higher gas prices are a problem that had been years in the making
2974209 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030

2974214 the bank of england is concerned that customers are being issued too many 20 notes which is endangering the whole circulation of cash
2974215 the high street banks would like to see the end of cash because they can make money out of cash and credit cards purchases but thats not in the interest of the consumer
2974216 if people take out 60 at a time they are more likely to spend it but smaller notes such as 5 will help them keep track of money

2974219 dwyane i think is at a level that he was when miami won the championship
2974220 the confidence he has youve seen highlights of some of the plays he has made that were so instinctively athletic those shows at that moment he has confidence in that body hes played as well as anyone
2974221 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2974222 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2974223 the building on the site the walls are just speculation but asbestos has been confirmed to be found in the blast debris area which now when the expert looked at it today they identified that they think and even still they cant say for sure that it doesnt go far

2974237 these boys have put in a massive effort and im very proud of them we came into this match as ulster champions and we had hoped to take it to the next level but in the end it was not to be
2974238 but in truth we did not seize the game those early misses obviously did not help us but even in the second half steven mcdonnell got two great points one after another and seemed to have given us the initiative
2974239 we had been dealing with those kind of high balls competently all day and then this one comes in matty forde gets it and puts it in the net i was disappointed with that
2974240 they took some good scores you cant argue with that but our heads seemed to go down after the goal went in
2974241 this is not the time for any premature decisions obviously we will want to start again next year and give it a rattle and its likely that some new faces will be in the side but for the moment we just want to reflect on the situation that faces us now
2974242 we employed a sweeper against dublin and it didnt work but it seemed to work all right against armagh thats the way football is i felt we were very focussed for this job and i think this showed because of the way we maintained our commitment
2974243 we took a bit of time to get going up front but thankfully things came right for us in the end we knew armagh were always going to be a very tough side to play against and this is how things turned out but we are very happy to be in the last four and while people are talking about the fact that we might meet dublin again we will just see what happens between them and tyrone next weekend

2974251 we hebben een voorstel gedaan om de werkdruk te verminderen de directie heeft hierop bedenktijd gevraagd om te zien wat haalbaar is

2974257 we hebben er bij het personeel op aangedrongen dat het zou meewerken aan een eventuele overname door het werk voort te zetten
2974258 alles zal uiteraard afhangen van de toestemming van de curator voor het voortzetten van de activiteiten en dat hangt van het orderboekje af
2974259 i do not want to be critical of the ifas attempts to get the games on on saturday but when i left windsor avenue on friday night no package had been agreed
2974260 i hope that the wording of the statement issued by the ifa was an error because i dont want the public thinking that we had an agreement but still wouldnt referee saturdays games
2974261 that might have been the case anyway but there was no agreement reached
2974262 we had no idea that championship clubs werent going to co operate and provide someone to help us by running the line
2974263 we had the situation at armagh on the opening day when dessie loughrey had to do everything on his own and the ballymoney united v larne game last tuesday was very close to not going ahead until the clubs said they would provide linesmen when the referee was about to leave
2974264 we had been told previously that senior referees would be taking charge of championship games with the odd exception for referee development purposes and that assistant referees would be in operation
2974265 i know that the intermediate committee have responsibility for all intermediate leagues but the championship isnt a normal intermediate league
2974266 portadown v donegal celtic isnt the same as a match in the premier division of the amateur league
2974267 championship clubs had to meet certain criteria to get into the league others who didnt make it are playing in a lower standard and that should have been reflected much more clearly
2974268 the president has given us what we want and he has assured me he can deliver
2974269 there is still work to do to get some of these issues through different committees but raymond kennedy has said he will get them through
2974270 the line up across the whole weekend was very impressive apart from kate gash
2974271 a major part of operations to force the georgian side the georgian authorities into peace in south ossetia has been completed

2974277 i have filled out my registration form and ballot request
2974278 we work really hard to make sure that the military who want to are able to vote
2974279 we gave out maybe 16 000 ballot applications since july a year ago
2974280 keeps the company down to the last private informed on how to register and vote
2974281 i didnt vote because the only way we could vote was by absentee ballot and we had to fill out all these forms
2974282 with technology computers and the unit voting officer it is very easy to register to vote
2974283 if you have internet access there really is no excuse not to vote
2974284 i felt i wasnt safe and that meant that my family wasnt safe
2974285 when i arrived here i went to the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr and talked to them about my case but i had no proof that i had worked with the u s army
2974286 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
2974287 we dont have any statistics but we consider there are between 400 000 and 450 000 refugees from iraq here
2974288 jordans population of five million has grown by 750 000 with the arrival of the iraqi refugees
2974289 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives
2974290 at this time most iraqis in jordan dont see a situation where they can return and some will never ever be able to go back
2974291 i put the name of the american commanding officer i worked with at al waleed in google and i couldnt believe it when i found him and saw his picture
2974292 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
2974293 we feel its our nations responsibility to help ivraa is a way to correct some mistakes
2974294 i feel a bit responsible as a former military officer for some of the displacement of iraqis
2974295 based on the documents presented to them they believe salah qualifies for the special immigration visa because its been shown he served as an interpreter for coalition forces
2974296 now in the streets of jordan i walk like this
2974297 but sometimes im still afraid i will be sent back to iraq i always think about this always
2974298 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2974299 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2974300 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2974301 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses

2974331 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
2974332 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
2974333 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
2974334 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
2974335 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
2974336 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
2974337 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
2974338 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
2974339 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
2974340 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2974341 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
2974342 ainsi fion fion fion les petites marionnettes ainsi fion fion fion trois ptits tours et puis sen vont
2974343 but wont they all just be horribly strong and totally unbalanced
2974344 they cant all be like that stop being a loser
2974345 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2974346 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2974347 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2974348 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy

2974350 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2974351 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2974352 obvious judicial interference and double standards caused me and my family to receive no justice what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2974353 the panel judge has found that the two defendants are not returning to thailand or presenting themselves to the court by the deadline which violates their bail conditions
2974354 the court has decided to confiscate their bail money and issue arrest warrants for the two defendants
2974355 i expected everything would be better that i might have a chance to prove my innocence and receive a fair trial when i returned to thailand
2974356 if i have a chance i will come back to die on thai ground

2974365 i have no idea ive not spoken to him about that as youre aware im sure senator edwards announced through one of his staffers he would not be attending the convention in denver
2974366 lets be very honest theres weakness when it comes to both political parties i feel very badly for john and elizabeth who are friends i know them and i know their families theyre going through a very difficult time i hope they can resolve this between them
2974367 obviously he let a lot of people down i feel for elizabeth but you know the public is forgiving obviously this is something between himself and his family and voters you know i feel for that family i still believe that john edwards is committed to reducing poverty i think his concern in the campaign was genuine
2974368 this is a difficult period you know but im just not going to be one of those that pile on richardson continued
2974369 barack obama has such a squeaky clean family image but its not over i dont think anybody in political circles including democrats believes edwards claim that he is not the father of this child
2974370 and then you additionally you have the money angle which is fred baron big trial lawyer big supporter of john edwards paying millions of dollars to relocate rielle hunter and andrew young and his family the man who has claimed paternity for the child to california supposedly just out of the goodness of his heart and without telling john edwards
2974371 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2974391 this thing is going to crest half a billion soon
2974392 the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
2974393 it gives the iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
2974394 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2974395 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2974396 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2974397 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2974398 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2974399 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2974400 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2974401 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2974402 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2974403 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2974404 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it

2974422 i dont think theres anything preventing the game complexity of bioshock from being on the wii
2974423 unfortunately i tested positive for a breath test which astonished me as i wasnt drinking late or doing anything silly on saturday night
2974424 its very unfortunate and im very disappointed in myself for letting sir mark and the owners down
2974425 im going to appeal and hopefully they will reduce it as its a very sorry circumstance
2974426 its very embarrassing and i cant really tell people how disappointed i am with myself
2974427 its just one of those things the swedish levels are a lot lower than ours and to be honest i dont know how i have tested positive
2974428 a professor from the vu university amsterdam said this bike deserves a nobel prize and ill tell you why old people do less exercise they cant go jogging for fear of injuries and pedalling a normal bike can be too hard for them but you can keep riding an electric bike well into old age
2974429 a full battery will give you an extra push for 50 kilometres and cost three to five cents and its so pleasant to ride that youll leave your car more often
2974430 divide the price by the number of kilometres you ride youre left with hardly anything a modern electric bike will keep going forever
2974431 ive had the bike i ride now since i was a teenager more than 40 years at that rate i can afford to lay out some cash again cant i
2974432 mum come round for coffee on that thing then youll keep moving and well have you with us for a long time to come
2974433 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
2974434 i dont see anything ground breaking in this if i had been involved in a car crash and suffered brain damage and could not fulfil my career i would be entitled to claim so i dont see why this case should be any different
2974435 by all accounts ben collett was already a very good player and had great potential sir alex ferguson said so and so did many others
2974436 if he had hung around in the game he would have earned significant sums of money but we are not always in charge of our own destinies
2974437 i have seen a lot of people have a career or half a career in football and not be able to cope when it comes to an end
2974438 but ben is a very bright young man whos going to university and hopefully will have a very good career and life
2974439 he was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought and will in the future bring to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football

2974499 dr mourao has expressed heartfelt agreement with mr makiguchis conviction that the purpose of education is the happiness of children dr mourao asserts that happiness is linked to overcoming obstacles and difficulties he says we must teach children that the bigger the obstacle the greater the happiness they will experience in surmounting it
2974500 dr mouraos perspective on the universe is indeed profound he explained his views in a highly accessible manner suggesting that the stars that shine in the night sky are a cosmic melting pot in which the raw materials of life are being constantly forged he points out that when a single star comes to the end of its life and explodes it sends the elements for producing new stars planets and life forms into the cosmos the end of a stars life he notes produces new life and life is the most precious treasure in the universe he further states that the universe is constantly giving birth to life and is the eternal treasure house of life he also asserts that in the rhythm of nam myoho renge kyo he can feel the fundamental energy that creates the universe
2974501 the 2007 peace proposal and soka education restoring the human connection the first step to global peace
2974502 we a group of educators from around the world walked for hours through a wild forest and were encouraged to let the trees moss and rocks touch us yes they touched us
2974503 this reconnect to the world certainly is an example of a connection being restored
2974504 because of this recent experience i have realized that the most important thing to teach young people is how to reconnect with nature and how to develop gratefulness and to be happy becoming a responsible citizen will follow automatically
2974505 without the qualitative elevation of individual human beings neither social transformation nor the creation of a more positive society is possible while this may seem obvious reliance on organizations and the submersion of the individual into the group is a failing all too common in human history
2974506 we need a fundamental reconfiguration of our world view if we are to move away from nuclear proliferation and toward disarmament the crucial element is to ensure that we are rooted firmly in a consciousness of the unity of the human family when our thinking is reconfigured around a sense of human solidarity even the most implacable difficulties will not cause us to condone the use of force without this kind of shift it will be difficult to extract ourselves from the quagmire logic of deterrence which is rooted in mistrust suspicion and fear
2974507 since human life encompasses biological cognitive and social dimensions human rights should be respected in all three of these dimensions
2974508 the great failure of education is that it has made people tribe conscious rather than species conscious
2974509 world of anger self perception of people in this life state of anger expands and swells until the ocean deeps would only lap their knees it becomes a matter of no concern to harm or even kill others trivialized in this way
2974510 it is this state of mind that would countenance the use of nuclear weapons it can equally be seen in the psychology of those who would advocate the use of such hideously cruel weapons people in such a state of life are blinded not only to the horrific suffering their actions wreak but also to the value of human life
2974511 dialogue is both an end and a means to human understanding in dialogical communication we engage others as different but equal we try to enter their world of meaning through an open ended process of communication and exploration in dialogue we change through mutual appreciation sympathy and empathy this is not the easiest method of human communication but it is the most fruitful that is why dialogue is the most meaningful path to negotiating a new global civilization based on the contributions of all past human civilizations

2974522 nitiren daishonin nos mostra que respeitar os outros como exemplificado pelas a es do bodhisattva jamais desprezar bjd constitui a base fundamental da pr tica do sutra de l tus e que a conduta de fazer o chakubuku dar continuidade a pr tica do bodhisattva jamais desprezar
2974523 n s aprendemos que quando as pessoas se devotam em contribuir para o mundo ent o todos os obst culos barreiras problemas e dificuldades desaparecem atrav s do trabalho em grupo n s aprendemos que entre as pessoas n o deve existir espa o para sentimentos negativos como raiva ou amargura n s agora vemos os obst culos e problemas que enfrentamos diariamente em nossa vida como desafios que tornam nossa vida mais excitante e interessante n s estamos prontos agora para enfrentar qualquer obst culo pois agora sabemos que o imposs vel n o nada imposs vel apenas uma grande palavra lan ada ao redor pelas pessoas pequenas que temem enfrentar os obst culos e os desafios da vida
2974524 n s cooperamos n s aprendemos coisas sobre um e outro coisas e habilidades que estavam escondidas dentro de cada um de n s durante aqueles dois anos eu consegui ver claramente que alguns de meus colegas est o de fato sabendo da grande quantidade de valor que existe em todas as pessoas e eu posso agora confiar neles mais facilmente

2974528 desde o in cio da revolu o industrial a civiliza o moderna tem vivenciado uma trajet ria de avan o fren tico servida pelas ferramentas do racionalismo cient fico a for a motriz tem sido a cobi a desenfreada a arrog ncia sem limites do ego superficial nada expressa isso t o fortemente do que as armas nucleares que transformam o direito vida de todas as pessoas da terra em ref m do dom nio e seguran a de certos pa ses elas s o o ep tome de uma civiliza o dedicada a saciar os desejos nascidos da fus o do desenvolvimento tecnol gico e dos objetivos militares
2974529 every person is precious each of us has a mission that only we can fulfill
2974530 nichiren daishonin indicates that respecting others as exemplified by the actions of bodhisattva never disparaging bnd constitutes the foundation of the practice of the lotus sutra and that to conduct shakubuku is to carry on the practice of bodhisattva never disparaging hence the fundamental significance of shakubuku naturally lies in respecting others on that premise the daishonin teaches us that treating others with respect in everything we do not just while practicing shakubuku is the correct way for human beings to behave
2974531 we learned that when people are devoted to contributing to the world then all the obstacles barriers problems and difficulties disappear through our group work we learned that between people there must be no space for negative feelings like anger or bitterness we now see the obstacles and problems that we face in everyday life as challenges that make our life more exciting and interesting we are ready now to face any obstacle because we now know that impossible is nothing impossible is just a big word thrown around by small people that fear to face the obstacles and challenges of life
2974532 we cooperated we learned things about one another things and abilities which were hidden inside each one of us during those two years i managed to see clearly that some of my fellow students are actually worth knowing people and i can now trust them more easily
2974533 limitlessly draw forth fundamental life force and wisdom from the world of the mystic law
2974534 the key skills for students in the twenty first century will be the ability to deal with complexity uncertainty and insecurity education for sustainable development includes peace education citizenship and global awareness environmental integrity and human rights this ability must draw upon the whole spectrum of issues pertaining to sustainability emphasizing especially issues such as personal attitudes empathy respect for difference support for the civil society and its institutions and the promotion of civil awareness and social justice
2974535 i believe we need to talk with students about what it means to be human
2974536 from the start of the industrial revolution modern civilization has been on a trajectory of fevered advance served by the tools of scientific rationalism the driving force has been the untrammeled pursuit of desire the limitless inflation of the superficial self nothing manifests this more fiercely than nuclear weapons which embody the willingness to hold the right to live of all people on earth hostage to the predominance and security concerns of certain countries they epitomize a civilization dedicated to the service of desire born of the fusion of technological development and military objectives
2974537 for our part the sgi will continue to work with other ngos and with un programs and agencies in promoting disarmament education harnessing the power and passion of youth to energize and expand the network of citizens seeking to rid the world of nuclear weapons

2974541 at first i felt very upset at losing my job and very self questioning then i realized that makiguchi himself was pushed out of his schools and it is not a disgrace to have difficulties on behalf of the lotus sutra recently i have dedicated my life to establishing soka education in europe when i did this and wrote to sensei things started to really move

2974561 we all go for the best i am a patriotic nigerian i would love the two teams super falcons and dream team iv to bring the gold medals back to nigeria
2974562 but what i am saying is that it is not automatic there must be a deliberate plan towards achieving that would you now tell me what these teams have experienced right from their preparatory stages were geared towards winning gold in the olympics
2974563 let all of us come down and do serious work on these lapses we must learn how to prepare adequately for competitions if we are to achieve our desired results and objectives
2974564 progressing far in this competition or winning the remaining matches depends on what the two coaches would put in the team before these matches they are the closest people to the team they should have observed the problems in the first matches and they should be able to offer solutions to these problems to get the needed results after all
2974565 they played good matches despite not winning their first matches but we have problems on the two teams which include technical and tactical problems you know i am somebody that is never satisfied with any result or level of achievement but even this time around we can see the lapses
2974566 it was the media who published on thursday that some of the boys players were not even accredited so what are we talking about is that not enough to destabilize the team the coach and the players themselves
2974567 that was the reason why i said that we just have to go back to the drawing board and see how we can organize our football if the teams are out of the competition now people would start blaming siasia and jossy lad but nobody would ask what problems they faced before jetting out for the olympics

2974618 what do i have to do to take out this man
2974619 i was fine he caught me with a left hook
2974620 not a great hook it was just a graze he didnt even hurt me at all or anything he hurt me before but that final punch was not his toughest punch
2974621 enthusiastically yeah i put on as much pressure as i could i brought the fight to him he hit the wall and he was tired and he was just trying to finish hard the last 30 seconds of the 10th round he was trying to steal the round in the last 30 seconds i dont know if he did and yeah he caught me with the left hook with one punch but it wasnt his strongest punch
2974622 thats just my style youll see when i walk my legs wobble a bit but it doesnt mean im hurt thats just the way i box you know im clumsy even when im ok moving around my legs are loaded man
2974623 i was boxing him great you know i was bouncing around and he was tired in the second round
2974624 i was still jabbing him jabbing him i dont know if i was winning the rounds in the judges eyes but in my eyes i was winning the rounds you know he was closing hard in the last 30 seconds but to me it wasnt enough to steal the rounds
2974625 i dont know ive gotta sit back and think about it
2974626 its a hard loss ive been lucky with espn ive had two great fights one win a 2001 victory over the late julian letterlough one loss
2974627 the thing that took it from me i was boxing good i was winning the round he caught me with that punch i had two more rounds you know i was gonna win those two rounds i dont know what was on those scorecards but i think i wouldve took it all
2974628 it gonzalez resistance didnt surprise me because i know i hit very hard you know it wasnt discouraging but he was a durable fighter you know you cant knock everybody out i know that thank god the referee was there
2974629 actually i dont think either one of those fighters cold take the punches that julio took tonight nope and thats just on the level that im on right now when its time to fight for the world championship ill be five times better than i was tonight
2974630 no when i get into the ring i do my thing

2974650 hai kamu sekalian mengapa kamu berbuat demikian kami ini adalah manusia biasa sama seperti kamu kami ada di sini untuk memberitakan injil kepada kamu supaya kamu meninggalkan perbuatan sia sia ini dan berbalik kepada allah yang hidup yang telah menjadikan langit dan bumi laut dan segala isinya 14 16 dalam zaman yang lampau allah membiarkan semua bangsa menuruti jalannya masing masing 14 17 namun ia bukan tidak menyatakan diri nya dengan berbagai bagai kebajikan yaitu dengan menurunkan hujan dari langit dan dengan memberikan musim musim subur bagi kamu ia memuaskan hatimu dengan makanan dan kegembiraan
2974651 tidakkah anda merasa tersanjung setiap kali anda berpidato orang datang berbondong bondong sampai tidak kebagian tempat mereka sangat menyanjung anda
2974652 tiap kali ingin berbangga saya ingat satu hal seandainya saya kelak dihukum gantung jumlah orang yang hadir pasti melonjak dua kali lipat
2974653 apakah ini yang kaulakukan kepada bangsa itu mengapakah engkau seorang diri saja yang duduk sedang seluruh bangsa itu berdiri di depanmu dari pagi sampai petang
2974654 sebab bangsa ini datang kepadaku untuk menanyakan petunjuk allah 18 16 apabila ada perkara di antara mereka maka mereka datang kepadaku dan aku mengadili antara yang seorang dan yang lain lagipula aku memberitahukan kepada mereka ketetapan ketetapan dan keputusan keputusan allah
2974655 tidak baik seperti yang kaulakukan itu 18 18 engkau akan menjadi sangat lelah baik engkau baik bangsa yang beserta engkau ini sebab pekerjaan ini terlalu berat bagimu takkan sanggup engkau melakukannya seorang diri saja 18 19 jadi sekarang dengarkanlah perkataanku aku akan memberi nasihat kepadamu dan allah akan menyertai engkau adapun engkau wakililah bangsa itu di hadapan allah dan kauhadapkanlah perkara perkara mereka kepada allah 18 20 kemudian haruslah engkau mengajarkan kepada mereka ketetapan ketetapan dan keputusan keputusan dan memberitahukan kepada mereka jalan yang harus dijalani dan pekerjaan yang harus dilakukan 18 21 di samping itu kaucarilah dari seluruh bangsa itu orang orang yang cakap dan takut akan allah orang orang yang dapat dipercaya dan yang benci kepada pengejaran suap tempatkanlah mereka di antara bangsa itu menjadi pemimpin seribu orang pemimpin seratus orang pemimpin lima puluh orang dan pemimpin sepuluh orang 18 22 dan sewaktu waktu mereka harus mengadili di antara bangsa maka segala perkara yang besar haruslah dihadapkan mereka kepadamu tetapi segala perkara yang kecil diadili mereka sendiri dengan demikian mereka meringankan pekerjaanmu dan mereka bersama sama dengan engkau turut menanggungnya 18 23 jika engkau berbuat demikian dan allah memerintahkan hal itu kepadamu maka engkau akan sanggup menahannya dan seluruh bangsa ini akan pulang dengan puas senang ke tempatnya

2974699 it wasnt an overdose i had a bad experience it was nowhere near an overdose it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
2974700 its something that everyone well not everyone smart people usually dont do it but its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
2974701 im not friends with any winehouse i dont live in camden ive never smoked crack in my life ive done other drugs ive had experiences with drugs some good some bad and its not something i want to pursue

2974709 samuel doesnt like seeing mommy feeding the new one it makes him freak out a little bit
2974710 he booked the room himself but wouldnt have realized that it had so much leather in its interior
2974711 he would have been a bit annoyed but the whole point of the trip is to travel anonymously so he wouldnt have caused a fuss
2974712 everything is leather as if you were a rich rancher i think they got a kick out of that
2974713 they looked really close there was no security around him or minders
2974714 they just looked like two lovers wrapped up in each others company
2974715 i was good in school but i was surprised because i didnt put too much time in studying i was always dreaming about the things i wanted to do when i was older like acting i still dont know why or how i passed because i literally put no time in
2974716 im always finding very tricky and hidden ways to sabotage any beautiful moment and its something so internal that i dont think even my friends or family can catch me doing it
2974717 he drew the floor plans and thought of the name
2974718 the whole idea was to make it a spot for us we wanted to make it our own space to hang out
2974719 everyone is really excited that heaths bar will open soon he played an active part in getting the project together
2974720 he specifically talked about having a big table for him and his family to sit at it was great working for heath he was the most unassuming guy
2974721 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a homewrecker
2974722 she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
2974723 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mom in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
2974724 sienna and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife when he released a statement in july saying he had split from his wife rosetta he had been sleeping on friends couches for six months
2974725 girls now keep asking for a kiss after every show on my tour i stay behind to do an autograph signing but about a dozen women will want a snog i just sweetly say no thank you if i kissed everybody who asked id probably go away with something i dont really want

2974730 everyone else will be immediate friends and family plus a few people from malawi that
2974731 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2974732 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with bernies wife rhonda and their family you are already missed
2974733 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the pre eminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2974734 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2974735 however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
2974736 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
2974737 seguirei lutando por um p dio e por uma vit ria neste ano e isso mostrar que continuo aqui quero mostrar que continuo sendo o melhor e que assim tenho que ter uma carreira grandiosa para isso preciso de p dios e vit rias

2974813 to us thats us as kids and as sisters minus everything else it was nice to share that people think i dont like talking about kylie but that couldnt be further from the truth i understand why people ask about her she is incredibly famous and loved by everyone so people want to know what it is like being her sister thats normal we are really different people so there has never been any competition

2974831 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2974832 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us
2974833 plymouth have said that burnley is their most hated side and they are 300 miles away
2974834 that could be because we relegated them once on the last day of the season and then spoiled their glory days when we beat them in the play offs in another season
2974835 the same thing applies to stockport i think there is a little bit of jealousy there
2974836 we go to a lot of clubs now and there is no trouble never an ounce of bother
2974837 i find it quite amusing its just like the song no one likes us we dont care

2974851 these results significantly improve our understanding of the 3 d reconnection process with a null pair structure the observations and suggested scenario pave the way for future studies on reconnection not only for space physicists but also for the astrophysical and laboratory plasmas communities since the chance of such in situ measurements is expected to be very rare
2974852 the results will also provide a valuable reference for the nasa magnetospheric multiscale mms mission and the esa cross scale mission a primary goal of these future missions is to measure the 3 d geometry of the inner reconnection region the results reported in grl present new observations and an associated scenario in such a region for the first time
2974853 this is indeed precisely the aim of the cross scale mission studying the heart of magnetic reconnection by measuring the electron scale near the null with four spacecraft as well as studying ion and fluid scales

2974857 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2974858 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2974859 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2974860 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2974861 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2974862 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2974863 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2974864 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2974865 it is a well known fact that anti social behaviour and youth disorder can severely impact on the quality of lives within communities
2974866 it seems that many of these sites are offering youngsters an easy accessible facility for them to boast about their involvement in gangs or the collection of weapons they own clearly this has to stop
2974867 we will continue to monitor social networking sites as part of our ongoing campaign against violence
2974868 first they whip the legs the back the neck the feet the hands and then they turn you around and get you in the front
2974869 they combined their display and search sales forces and they may be starting to see some benefit from cross selling opportunities
2974870 the account reps might be more effectively talking about and being able to show how spending across yahoos whole network can be more effectively managed
2974871 they were so deeply ingrained in the news in the second quarter that it appeared there was a small spike in the inventory available
2974872 it was likely fueled by people flocking to the yahoo site to keep tabs on what was going on
2974873 yahoo has been losing market share directly to google for some time
2974874 and spending is still not where it once was for example our data shows that yahoo had 22 of these advertisers search budgets in the first quarter of 2007 but well definitely be tracking this in the third quarter and recommend that our customers continue to assess their opportunities on yahoo

2975061 a friend of mine i hung out with his brother was a barber on bell island and i used to sort of watch him work and i just liked the idea
2975062 when i opened my own place my thought was to open with one chair to make a living and provide for the family and then i just sort of had the second chair and third

2975073 women all over the world have very negative relationships with themselves yet they expect to create positive relationships with others that will in effect cancel out any negative feelings that they carry about themselves they discover over time though that no matter who they involve themselves with good bad or indifferent or no what they do and where they go they cant escape themselves whatever negative feelings and beliefs you hold about yourself will colour not only your vision of the world but the interactions you have and the people that you draw in as a fallback girl you may have been emotionally schooled by either parent to believe that your needs were not important and that your feelings should go unexpressed so as an adult even though you want to feel loved and love you find yourself creating relationship patterns that mirror what you have learnt about yourself in childhood in believing that you are of very little importance you dont value yourself and you dont value what you bring to the table you might feel disbelief that someone like the mr unavailable that has taken up with you could be interested in you not because you are an awful person but because you have no idea who you are and how valuable you are as an individual entity instead you feel worthless and by associating with men that help you chase an elusive feeling you believe that your value will go up by association this is no different to people who surround themselves with material things to bolster their stature yet no matter what they buy it doesnt change the things that theyre trying to mask

2975077 in town you are reminded of your caste right from the tea shop to the street corner where you sleep people chase you away as if you were an evil spirit you can even be born as a dog but not a dalit
2975078 i do any work i get when i have nothing to do i come back and do what dalit labourers traditionally do removing the husk from coconuts
2975079 i have no intentions of moving to town i know i will be abused for everything from drinking water to entering a temple

2975086 the editor of newsweek jon meacham said he had not read the manuscript but he offered a reason why the media might be silent i think theres a kind of bush bashing fatigue out there
2975087 americans just cant believe an american president would engage in conduct that smacks of such criminality and thus the whole notion of taking the president to court for murder is a revolutionary one
2975088 if you say our young men didnt die for bush cheney and rove then whom did they die for
2975089 what i strongly believe without absolutely knowing is that this man has no respect or love for this country
2975090 i dont know about you but if i ever killed just one person even accidentally like in a car accident id never have another perfect day as long as i lived
2975091 bushs alleged crime is on such a grand scale that it would greatly dishonor those who paid the ultimate price because of it if he were not to pay the ultimate penalty
2975092 very credible argument could be made that in a real sense he did intend to have american soldiers killed in his war
2975093 not only didnt the defendant intend to kill but he had no way of knowing whether someone would die or not but while bush never specifically intended to kill any american soldier he absolutely knew american soldiers would necessarily die in his war
2975094 therefore a case could be made that unless bush intended to have a war without any casualties which is an argument that would make bush sound absurd he did in fact specifically intend to have american soldiers killed

2975101 i need to ask and not to be rude or offensive why is it someone elses fault that you overeat and dont exercise enough i know that sounds really harsh but seriously there are so many people out there who simply eat too much of the wrong things and then blame mum and dad or grandad or uncle joe bloggs cause he was mean your mum telling you that she was worried about your coordination is what mothers say and do as a mother you worry about the development of your child not just physically but emotionally too and you may not always say the right things but it comes from the right place in your heart i would suggest you introduce ie and moderation along with your exercise and youll find that its nothing to do with your mum or anyone else and everything to do with bad habits and too many calories cheers
2975102 i know this was long but i feel like i have to get it all out in order to move forward its not my mothers fault she is a lovely woman and would have had no idea there was such a huge problem and i was so unhappy

2975175 ive made this statue after being inspired by one of my seniors it took me 30 40 days to make it i had to study many different photographs to make this statue ive tried to make it exactly like the original even the numbers of holes in the statue are same as the original
2975176 we had heard about the bamiyan buddha and were very disturbed when the taliban destroyed it when the statue got ready it was put on exhibition and many people came to see the statue
2975177 world politics would be very different today were it not for winston churchill
2975178 victoria is a more interesting one she was not the most important figure of the victorian era but she was its greatest symbol
2975179 i think it is most astonishing that winston churchill has been omitted
2975180 i did lobby for wales i dont think you can talk about britishness without including wales
2975181 and as for the welsh being left out i would argue that david lloyd george was a fairly important part of british history
2975182 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2975183 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2975184 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2975185 my wife and i have traveled to reside in england
2975186 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2975187 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2975188 they came into our apartment they ransacked our entire apartment went through all of our bags all of our luggage despite the fact that we never consented to any searches
2975189 we were taken to the police holding facility and interrogated for several hours before we were deported
2975190 we are still waiting for the seven other victims to show up at the association for help but we do not know their whereabouts they must be truly suffering
2975191 we are ready to handle the cases of the remaining victims and send them back home once they appear
2975192 we are ready to investigate and report back to our fellow indians as soon as possible to avoid them falling victim to these agents
2975193 we do not want indians to land in trouble especially when they are away from their homeland
2975194 he says he is attracted to horses and couldnt resist it when he saw the animal in the field
2975195 we thought wed seen everything but this beats them all
2975196 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2975197 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president
2975198 hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2975199 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2975200 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
2975201 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2975202 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2975203 we really want to have someone here who can speak that language who can really relate to that community
2975204 i would like a handful but one would be a great start
2975205 brazilians are very warm people it is easy for us to get used to other backgrounds other cultures
2975206 the women see the telenovelas and the brazilian magazines and they want those styles they like to look good and theyre not afraid to spend money
2975207 with the shops and the restaurants it gives a little bounce
2975208 we want to participate and give something before we ask for anything
2975209 we want to change peoples ideas of what immigrants are like
2975210 if youre a victim of a crime your immigration status is not going to come into play
2975211 we are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people
2975212 will be the best advertisement and there will quickly be more

2975221 we are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people
2975222 will be the best advertisement and there will quickly be more
2975223 i would hope to see a portuguese speaking officer in my time here
2975224 we have many children of native brazilians who are now naturalized citizens maybe that first one is right here in mount vernon high school 17 or 18 years old already thinking about a career
2975225 though we expect a continued deterioration as the year goes on as american and european consumers stay at home the resilience of demand for chinas exports is still remarkable

2975233 the aim of these public hearings is to accord ordinary citizens a platform to engage the committees
2975234 public hearings have always played a crucial role in shaping the legislative direction which parliament has championed over the past decade
2975235 in 2004 the government disbanded the sa narcotics bureau and since then drug related crimes have multiplied
2975236 it is apparent that the powers that be are hellbent on dissolving the scorpions just as they did the other saps special units such as the child protection unit
2975237 we have seen and experienced the negative effects of such strategy
2975238 these few realities are sufficient cause for the scorpions to be retained and in fact be strengthened
2975239 if the unit is doing its job and in investigating anc and its alliance partners office bearers then so be it government and the ruling party are not above the law
2975240 not a day goes by when there is not an incident where a patient visitor or doctor are stuck in the lifts this morning monday none of the lifts were working
2975241 the call centre impophoma that has been set up for repairs simply does not work
2975242 this is a huge liability issue if a patient suffers damage because of a broken lift they can sue the hospital for millions all the lifts need to be replaced
2975243 the free will of each is known to him and therefore what is best for each and most fitting is foreseen and prearranged in his providence par 4
2975244 these were the reasons as i think which gave rise to the diversity of this world wherein divine providence arranges all creatures individually in positions corresponding to the variation in their movements and the fixed purpose of their minds

2975248 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2975249 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2975250 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2975251 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2975252 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2975253 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2975254 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2975255 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2975256 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2975257 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2975258 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2975259 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2975260 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2975261 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2975262 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2975263 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2975264 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2975265 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2975266 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2975267 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2975268 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2975269 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2975270 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2975271 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2975272 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality

2975275 moscow may be expected to punish israel for its intervention
2975276 i think the indian team are missing dhoni a lot during this series especially with their top order struggling to come to terms during the series dhoni s presence in the lower order would have given a big boost to the indian batting as the indians needed more than one attacking batsmen to counter ajantha mendis and mutthiah muralitharan
2975277 dhoni would have made a huge difference to this side even as wicketkeeper though both dinesh karthik and parthiv patel are talented they could not contribute to the team s cause as they were found a bit rusty but dhoni could have done a much better job as he has been playing continues cricket and did a commendable job against australia and south africa before opting to rest
2975278 we have been at the forefront of the climate change issue for years a large percentage of our electricity already comes from renewable energy sources and we are in the tropics we dont have problems heating up our homes and buildings during the winter
2975279 the first thing is measuring what the emissions actually are then were looking at ways that we can do our agricultural practices better to reduce the emissions in addition to production we are also involved in transportation so we are also looking at ways of being more fuel efficient
2975280 you can see the growth here in the tropics its incredible in four months they can grow 50 to 60cm
2975281 the tree starts absorbing carbon dioxide from when its a seedling especially during the first 10 to 15 years its a very efficient way of absorbing carbon from the atmosphere
2975282 costa rica has been the only country in central america ahead of everyone else in terms of protecting the environment
2975283 i believe this is the first step to mitigate even more the impact they have on climate change the only thing i see is a little bit problematic is by 2021 its a huge target
2975284 the real challenge for costa rica is transportation most of our emissions come from this sector we really have to start making changes in how costa ricans are moving but as the economy grows if more people want to have their own cars we have to take that in to account
2975285 we are in the right position in this country to be the crucible for the changes that the rest of the world is looking for we cannot let it fail we need to get everyone on our side to make this small experiment in something very radical but very necessary to work

2975288 saccawu reached a deadlock with the city lodge group at the ccma commission for conciliation mediation and arbitration over wage increases and conditions of employment
2975289 this is another in a range of disputes and deadlocks reached between the union and various companies and like most other disputes in the sector it is informed by low wage levels and declining living standards as a result of rising inflation interest rates increases in petrol and electricity prices and the explosion of increases in food prices
2975290 with our staffing structure to have someone off for that length of time would force us to employ another person we think that 9 days off for office bearers is sufficient
2975291 it needs to ensure that there is access to land and at the same time provide support that makes it viable

2975352 auch nach dem beitritt bulgariens zur europ ischen union werden wir die justizielle zusammenarbeit auf grundlage der heutigen gemeinsamen erkl rung fortsetzen unsere justizministerien werden sich auch k nftig ber die umsetzung von rechtsakten der europ ischen union unterrichten und austauschen eine zusammenarbeit wird aber nicht nur im bereich der rechtssetzung stattfinden auch bei der praktischen anwendung von gesetzen sollen anhand von seminaren kongressen und expertenbesuchen kenntnisse ber das funktionieren der gerichte der verwaltung oder der juristenausbildung und fortbildung vermittelt werden das ist nach dem j ngst ver ffentlichten fortschrittsbericht der europ ischen kommission zu bulgarien besonders wichtig
2975353 in einem engen austausch k nnen wir bulgarien bei der praktischen anwendung von gesetzen unterst tzen und beim aufbau einer unabh ngigen und funktionierenden justiz helfen konkret habe ich meiner amtskollegin miglena tatscheva angeboten einen gemeinsamen workshop in deutschland zum thema korruptionsbek mpfung in der justiz durchzuf hren es ist au erdem sehr wichtig dass die europ ische kommission ihr monitoring fortsetzt bis bulgarien alle benchmarks erf llt hat

2975370 meine herzlichen gl ckw nsche an evo morales zu diesem berzeugenden ergebnis die bolivianerinnen und bolivianer haben ihrem anspruch auf sozialen und demokratischen wandel erneut deutlich ausdruck verliehen
2975371 mit der pr sidentschaft von morales verbindet sich zum ersten mal f r die bislang ausgeschlossenen sozialen schichten und indigenen gruppen nach jahrhunderten der ausgrenzung und diskriminierung und nach jahrzehnten neoliberaler wirtschaftspolitik die hoffnung auf mehr soziale und politische teilhabe die regierung morales hat mit konkreten ma nahmen wie den verstaatlichungen im energiesektor und dem verfassungsprozess damit begonnen eine gerechtere teilhabe aller an den reicht mern des landes und an politischer macht durchzusetzen diese politik hat im gestrigen referendum die zustimmung von ber 60 prozent der bolivianerinnen und bolivianer gefunden das bolivianische beispiel macht auch in vielen anderen l ndern denjenigen mut die um ihre sozialen und demokratischen rechte k mpfen die opposition in bolivien muss dieses berzeugende votum f r morales anerkennen ich hoffe sie nimmt das angebot zur zusammenarbeit an und versucht nicht l nger einen demokratischen prozess mit undemokratischen mitteln aufzuhalten die gewalt in den ostprovinzen und die verfassungswidrigen sezessionsbestrebungen m ssen aufh ren ich fordere die bundesregierung und ihre vertreterinnen und vertreter vor ort auf hier endlich klar stellung zu beziehen und der bolivianischen regierung den r cken zu st rken

2975373 es ist ein bemerkenswertes signal f r die akzeptanz und notwendigkeit einer nachhaltigkeitsstrategie dass hochrangige und namhafte expertinnen und experten der einladung der landesregierung gefolgt sind und ihre bereitschaft zur mitarbeit in den gremien erkl rt haben

2975414 as the states chief legal officers attorneys general have had significant experience with the operation of these state law privileges

2975420 us entities that are responsible for large sources of greenhouse emissions will also be responsible for analyzing the impact of those emissions on listed species like penguins
2975421 theres absolutely no reason why the law doesnt apply to greenhouse gas emissions and shouldnt be enforced

2975428 anyone who reads a zine can create one insofar as peoples thoughts and experiences are made public zines are not only an important personal outlet and means of empowerment but also have a significant social and political function

2975434 does denvers democratic national convention and the democrats nomination process really warrant civil disobedience

2975446 before blaming everything on one facet we need to analyze all of pop culture and media representation at large
2975447 they ask me if im black or white im neither race is a made up thing i dont believe in it my genes tie me to those that dispise me made a living killing the ones that inspire me im not just talkin bout singing and dancing i was taught life and manhood by black men so i am a product of that understandin and a small part of me feels like i am them does that make me a lier maybe but i dont want the white folks that praise me to think they can claim me cuz you didnt make me you dont appreciate what i know to be great but yet you relate to me and that frustrates me but what can i say cuz i know that i benefit from something i hate but make no mistake our connection aint fake its never too late to clear off the slate you follow my tape you know what im about whatever comes up must come out

2975469 it is of vital importance to get off to a good start i had a good feeling about this game and it proved right
2975470 it was pleasing that defense played a good game apart from maybe the first ten minutes the offense was very versatile the entire time of course it was a bit hesitant at times as sometimes happens
2975471 i told the boys to go out to the field and enjoy themselves they have worked hard and they did what i said the next game against germany will be very difficult but we will play hard

2975537 essa derrota para o botafogo n o me deixa triste foi um resultado normal porque trata se de um time que est crescendo no campeonato o que atrapalhou foram outros resultados que tivemos no passado como o empate com o figueirense em casa a derrota para o time reserva do sport perdemos para o coritiba e empatamos com o atl tico mg fora advers rios que n o tiraram pontos do gr mio nosso rival direto
2975538 o campeonato est nivelado temos que fazer nossa parte que vencer e torcer contra o gr mio o flamengo chegou a abrir nove pontos na frente se n o me engano e depois caiu ainda n o existe um candidato ao t tulo
2975539 fiquei s olhando para as pessoas vendo qual a rea o delas
2975540 tudo aconteceu muito r pido n o sei explicar quando ganhei n o acreditei
2975541 o lance foi acreditar e n o se curvar para ningu m
2975542 j conversamos no vesti rio hora de pensar na sul americana ainda mais por se tratar de um gre nal precisamos da vit ria para readquirir a confian a da torcida

2975550 em termos de resultado a ida para o atl tico pr foi um desastre em termos de experi ncia foi muito boa acho que na vida o que vale a experi ncia no futebol h o costume de se avaliar o trabalho s pelos resultados n o pela hist ria do profissional
2975551 quando se come a um planejamento e vai alinhando as contrata es a chance de dar certo de 80 por m quando voc entra em um processo existente e tem de fazer remontagens voc precisa acertar as pe as se adaptar a um novo ambiente e tudo isso faz com que a chance caia para a metade
2975552 qualquer treinador demora de dois a tr s meses para conhecer o clube entender o grupo de jogadores e tudo que o cerca por m s vezes o tempo n o combina com os resultados ent o esses clubes s est o mantendo os treinadores porque est o bem pois caso contr rio j teria mudado a velha hist ria de saber se est em primeiro porque ficou com o treinador ou se o treinador continuou porque est em primeiro
2975553 temos de mudar muita coisa no futebol e criar um contrato que exigisse uma perman ncia maior dos t cnicos se um clube demitir por exemplo ter de pagar o sal rio do profissional at o fim do ano j o t cnico se quiser sair n o pode treinar um time da mesma divis o isso for aria os dois lados a um acordo maior mas infelizmente a cultura n o vai mudar enquanto os respons veis n o forem cobrados

2975567 the bobcats and the entire charlotte community embraced me from day one
2975568 its exciting to enter this season with a hall of fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning
2975569 it was important for us to get a deal done
2975570 securing emeka demonstrates that bob johnson and the rest of our ownership group are committed to building a winning franchise in charlotte any time you have a player who consistently ranks among the nbas best in rebounding and shot blocking you want to keep a guy like that around
2975571 i still dont know what i did wrong before my last round i did the exact same preparation i probably started trying too hard
2975572 everybody asked me what do you think of this one compared to 1984 but 1984 was in l a so not many people were there
2975573 today here i feel like im back home everybody calling me name they still remember me im so happy to be here in beijing

2975584 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
2975585 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
2975586 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
2975587 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
2975588 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
2975589 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
2975590 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
2975591 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
2975592 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
2975593 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
2975594 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
2975595 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
2975596 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
2975597 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
2975598 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
2975599 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
2975600 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
2975601 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
2975602 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
2975603 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
2975604 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
2975605 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
2975606 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
2975607 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
2975608 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
2975609 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
2975610 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
2975611 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
2975612 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
2975613 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
2975614 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
2975615 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
2975616 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
2975617 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
2975618 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
2975619 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
2975620 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
2975621 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
2975622 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
2975623 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics

2975630 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
2975631 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
2975632 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor

2975647 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
2975648 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
2975649 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
2975650 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
2975651 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
2975652 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
2975653 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
2975654 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
2975655 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
2975656 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
2975657 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
2975658 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
2975659 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
2975660 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
2975661 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
2975662 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
2975663 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
2975664 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
2975665 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
2975666 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
2975667 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
2975668 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
2975669 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
2975670 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
2975671 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
2975672 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
2975673 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
2975674 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
2975675 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
2975676 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
2975677 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
2975678 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
2975679 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
2975680 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
2975681 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
2975682 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
2975683 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
2975684 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
2975685 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
2975686 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
2975687 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
2975688 ive enjoyed all the countries ive played in including china but here it is very different
2975689 because of my experience i find that im helping the team a lot more i have a translator and ive been passing on tips to the coach i might say to him that a particular player is very good and well try to play together i dont speak chinese but football is a universal language and it all seems to work out fine at times it is a little scary but t does make you grow up both as a footballer and as a man
2975690 we have a young team and although weve not won a game here yet for me this tournament is more about the development of these players
2975691 it has been a great honour to take part of the olympics and i am sure that my team mates have learned a lot from playing italy and cameroon hopefully these players can break through to the senior side after playing at this tournament
2975692 in the future we need to be going to the world cup and i think that experiences like this together with the extra experience they are getting at club level will help us a lot

2975711 when i was volunteering at small mammals someone said you need to go see the invertebrate exhibit i walked into this exhibit and the way the tanks are lit up and the lights are dim and getting that interaction with someone walking up to me and saying oh would you like to see a brittle star feeding to be able to sit on a stool with my face right up against the tank and watch this feeding was just absolutely incredible
2975712 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
2975713 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
2975714 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
2975715 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
2975716 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
2975717 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
2975718 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision

2975724 for the kids it probably has all the appeal of getting to pretend to shoot someone but in a form a little more palatable to moms
2975725 i wish i could do both at the same time
2975726 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
2975727 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
2975728 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
2975729 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
2975730 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
2975731 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
2975732 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits

2975740 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
2975741 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
2975742 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities

2975751 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
2975752 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
2975753 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
2975754 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
2975755 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
2975756 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
2975757 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
2975758 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
2975759 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
2975760 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
2975761 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
2975762 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
2975763 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
2975764 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
2975765 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
2975766 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
2975767 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
2975768 the two sides agreed to continue negotiations in a constructive atomsphere
2975769 solana and jalili voiced satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and the contacts afterwards
2975770 ves busca la galleta magica que habla y pararemos la ambruna en el mundo
2975771 we want to go to chakothi to send them goods because they are facing an economic blockade
2975772 when all of the judicial and appeal processes have exhausted themselves if any of the three are subject to a death penalty australia will make a plea of clemency on their behalf at that time
2975773 all legal avenues have not fully been exhausted thats why the question of clemency is not on the table yet
2975774 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
2975775 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
2975776 the traffic jams are very serious and many vehicles and passengers are stuck
2975777 local inhabitants face many difficulties because there is not enough food
2975778 two more bodies have been recovered they had been swept away in the strong currents
2975779 i was running and kept touching my head legs and arms to make sure i wasnt hurt because i couldnt believe i wasnt hit
2975780 a lot of people were standing there watching like they were fireworks i was like get out of here people
2975781 it shouldnt have been put in a residential area it should not have been there
2975782 nobody did a damn thing nobody and now the damage is done
2975783 ive seen homes from explosion before where its nothing but a pile of rubble i didnt see any of that here
2975784 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2975785 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2975786 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
2975787 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
2975788 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
2975789 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
2975790 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
2975791 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
2975792 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
2975793 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
2975794 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
2975795 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
2975796 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
2975797 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
2975798 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
2975799 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
2975800 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
2975801 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
2975802 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
2975803 david houlding will be one of those who will hold on to his freehold rather than switch to common tenure when it comes in
2975804 i expect many of you suspect i will not be willing to hand over my freehold but you will be wrong not only will i be handing in my freehold and coming under common tenure but i will hope to get my letter in by return of post
2975805 the church of the living god the pillar and foundation of truth
2975806 preach the gospel at all times when necessary use words
2975807 regardless of what congress does regardless of what corporations do companies like us are just going to have to work harder to make sure that what they submit to the patent office really has all the is dotted and the ts crossed
2975808 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
2975809 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
2975810 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
2975811 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
2975812 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
2975813 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
2975814 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
2975815 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
2975816 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
2975817 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
2975818 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
2975819 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
2975820 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
2975821 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
2975822 purchasing debt at big discounts is a terrific one off opportunity
2975823 but firms like gso with their ability to provide all the debt to buy outs are going to change private equity in a lasting way
2975824 a message has been sent and i dont think well see a return to that
2975825 we remain concerned that during this interim time period our members will continue to be exposed to these distort and short
2975826 the early numbers suggest that all of this is fueling more interest
2975827 the bottom line is youve seen a significant turn in commodity prices
2975828 i feel pretty good about my statement that we expect inflation to moderate over time
2975829 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
2975830 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
2975831 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
2975832 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
2975833 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
2975834 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
2975835 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
2975836 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
2975837 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
2975838 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
2975839 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
2975840 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
2975841 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
2975842 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
2975843 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
2975844 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
2975845 our study sheds new light on how that process works
2975846 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
2975847 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
2975848 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
2975849 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
2975850 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
2975851 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
2975852 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
2975853 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
2975854 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
2975855 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
2975856 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
2975857 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
2975858 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
2975859 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
2975860 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
2975861 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
2975862 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
2975863 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
2975864 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
2975865 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
2975866 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2975867 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2975868 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2975869 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
2975870 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
2975871 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
2975872 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
2975873 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
2975874 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
2975875 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
2975876 one of the obvious high priorities in my talks with president hugo chavez would be the fermentation of anti american sentiment in latin america
2975877 to avoid being mistaken for a sellout i chose my friends carefully the more politically active black students t he marxist professors and structural feminists
2975878 a close look at john mccains senate voting record on judicial confirmations makes it painfully clear that progressives need to ignore the rantings of the ann coulter crowd and believe john mccain when he says he will listen to sam brownback and appoint judges like samuel alito and antonin scalia
2975879 indeed one looks in vain for a judge who is too ideologically conservative for mccain he voted to confirm robert bork clarence thomas and unless ive missed something every other republican judicial nominee voted on in his 22 years in the senate
2975880 even more tellingly as part of his negotiation in 2005 of what has been dubbed the
2975881 no one thinks john mccain would nominate ethically challenged judges but there is every reason to think that he will nominate ideological conservatives to the supreme court and lower federal courts
2975882 this is important because federal courts are already dominated by republican appointees seven of the nine justices and a sizeable majority of lower federal court judges were appointed by republican presidents with the courts liberal moderate judges on average 15 years older than the courts conservatives john mccain in the white house could easily deliver the court to the right wing for a generation
2975883 we are very fortunate that our president in these challenging days can rely on the counsel of a man who has demonstrated time and again the resolve experience and patriotism that will be required for success and the hard headed clear thinking necessary to prevail in this global fight between good and evil
2975884 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
2975885 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
2975886 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
2975887 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2975888 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2975889 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2975890 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2975891 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2975892 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2975893 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2975894 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2975895 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2975896 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2975897 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2975898 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2975899 to quiet restrained new zealanders this may at times appear intimidating
2975900 i have been trying to improve my relations with midwives
2975901 when the children are at school and not during the holidays i think they should be doing something for themselves
2975902 its putting so much strain on the families and the parents and you want to be able to be a good parent you want to be able to be there for them when they come home from their day at school
2975903 you want failure you introduce work test sanctions for dhb and the only people that will suffer are the children
2975904 by forcing out mothers into minimum wage labour so they can provide cheap labour for john keys big business round table mates they wont earn much more on their benefit and the kids get inferior childcare and supervision
2975905 even if employment is easing somewhat retail always needs a large pool of people to keep it ticking over
2975906 wha happen crop over music from crop over this year cant reach here dem waiting on steam boat to bring the tunes man this is internet era download man download
2975907 die st rken eines jeden mediums f r sich einzusetzen
2975908 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
2975909 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
2975910 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
2975911 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
2975912 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases

2975914 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
2975915 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
2975916 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
2975917 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
2975918 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
2975919 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
2975920 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
2975921 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
2975922 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
2975923 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
2975924 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
2975925 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
2975926 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
2975927 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
2975928 droits de lhomme des athl tes crivent au pr sident chinois
2975929 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
2975930 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
2975931 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
2975932 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
2975933 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
2975934 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
2975935 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
2975936 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
2975937 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
2975938 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
2975939 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
2975940 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
2975941 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
2975942 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
2975943 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
2975944 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
2975945 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
2975946 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
2975947 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
2975948 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
2975949 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
2975950 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2975951 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2975952 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2975953 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2975954 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2975955 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2975956 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2975957 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2975958 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2975959 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2975960 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
2975961 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2975962 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2975963 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2975964 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2975965 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2975966 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2975967 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2975968 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2975969 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2975970 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2975971 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2975972 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2975973 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2975974 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2975975 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2975976 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2975977 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2975978 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2975979 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2975980 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2975981 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2975982 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2975983 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2975984 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2975985 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2975986 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2975987 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2975988 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2975989 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2975990 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
2975991 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2975992 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2975993 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2975994 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2975995 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2975996 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2975997 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2975998 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2975999 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2976000 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2976001 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2976002 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2976003 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2976004 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2976005 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2976006 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2976007 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2976008 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2976009 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2976010 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2976011 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2976012 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2976013 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
2976014 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
2976015 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
2976016 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2976017 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
2976018 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
2976019 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
2976020 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
2976021 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
2976022 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2976023 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
2976024 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
2976025 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
2976026 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
2976027 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
2976028 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
2976029 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
2976030 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
2976031 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
2976032 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
2976033 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
2976034 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
2976035 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
2976036 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
2976037 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
2976038 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
2976039 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
2976040 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
2976041 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
2976042 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
2976043 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
2976044 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
2976045 i do not permit a woman to teach a man
2976046 i do not permit a woman to teach at all
2976047 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
2976048 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
2976049 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
2976050 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
2976051 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
2976052 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
2976053 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
2976054 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
2976055 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
2976056 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
2976057 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
2976058 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
2976059 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
2976060 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
2976061 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2976062 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2976063 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2976064 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2976065 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2976066 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2976067 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2976068 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2976069 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2976070 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2976071 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2976072 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2976073 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2976074 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
2976075 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
2976076 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
2976077 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
2976078 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
2976079 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
2976080 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
2976081 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
2976082 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
2976083 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children
2976084 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
2976085 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
2976086 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
2976087 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
2976088 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
2976089 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
2976090 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
2976091 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
2976092 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
2976093 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
2976094 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2976095 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2976096 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2976097 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2976098 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2976099 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2976100 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2976101 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2976102 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2976103 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2976104 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2976105 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2976106 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2976107 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2976108 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2976109 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2976110 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2976111 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2976112 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2976113 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
2976114 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
2976115 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
2976116 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
2976117 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
2976118 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
2976119 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
2976120 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
2976121 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2976122 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2976123 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2976124 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2976125 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2976126 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
2976127 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2976128 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2976129 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2976130 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2976131 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2976132 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2976133 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2976134 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2976135 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
2976136 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
2976137 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
2976138 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
2976139 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
2976140 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
2976141 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
2976142 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
2976143 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
2976144 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2976145 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2976146 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2976147 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2976148 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2976149 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2976150 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2976151 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2976152 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2976153 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2976154 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2976155 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2976156 just so you all know we did set a record
2976157 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2976158 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2976159 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2976160 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2976161 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2976162 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2976163 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
2976164 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2976165 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2976166 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2976167 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2976168 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2976169 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2976170 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2976171 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2976172 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2976173 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2976174 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2976175 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2976176 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2976177 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2976178 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2976179 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2976180 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2976181 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2976182 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2976183 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2976184 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2976185 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2976186 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2976187 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2976188 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2976189 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
2976190 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
2976191 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2976192 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2976193 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2976194 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2976195 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2976196 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2976197 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2976198 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2976199 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2976200 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2976201 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
2976202 we will do whatever we can to save these children
2976203 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
2976204 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
2976205 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
2976206 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
2976207 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
2976208 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
2976209 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
2976210 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
2976211 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
2976212 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
2976213 for the past five years countless latin artists and singers have truly embraced the life mission of st jude by supporting the angels amp stars gala
2976214 thanks to their contribution and charitable donations they are helping us save the lives of children with deadly diseases

2976216 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
2976217 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
2976218 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
2976219 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
2976220 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
2976221 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
2976222 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
2976223 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
2976224 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
2976225 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
2976226 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
2976227 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
2976228 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
2976229 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
2976230 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited
2976231 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2976232 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2976233 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2976234 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2976235 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2976236 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2976237 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2976238 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2976239 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2976240 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2976241 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2976242 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2976243 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2976244 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2976245 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2976246 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2976247 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2976248 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2976249 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2976250 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2976251 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2976252 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2976253 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2976254 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2976255 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2976256 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2976257 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2976258 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2976259 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2976260 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2976261 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2976262 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2976263 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2976264 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2976265 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2976266 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2976267 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2976268 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2976269 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2976270 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2976271 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2976272 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2976273 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2976274 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2976275 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2976276 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2976277 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2976278 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2976279 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2976280 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2976281 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2976282 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2976283 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2976284 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2976285 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2976286 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2976287 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2976288 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2976289 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2976290 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2976291 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2976292 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2976293 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2976294 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2976295 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2976296 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2976297 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2976298 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2976299 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2976300 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2976301 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2976302 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2976303 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2976304 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2976305 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2976306 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2976307 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2976308 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2976309 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2976310 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2976311 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2976312 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2976313 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2976314 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2976315 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

2976327 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2976328 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2976329 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

2976371 the beijing olympics organizing committee spent several years to gather candidate songs we collected thousands of songs i felt that many songs seemed to used hand in hand the theme song of seoul olympics as a model many people including media thought that the theme song of beijing olympics should be similar to that kind of song hand in hand and many lyricists and composers followed that style finally the same was i
2976372 one day i happened to hear you and i i felt that the song was beautiful at that time the lyrics and music are simple the major purpose of our creative work was to complete an artwork on site we wanted to create a unique original unmatched and the greatest behavioral artwork in the world and we wanted to express our best wishes the lyrics of this song like you and me from one world we are one family are touching and easy to learn so other directors immediately loved this song and we felt that it fit the theme of 2008 beijing olympics harmony we recommended this song to musical professionals they all liked it
2976373 the message of this song is pure and simple when i firstly heard this song i could not believe that it was the theme song later i felt that its purity and simplicity was a good idea it is different from the grand style that we might expect but it was creative to choose this song especially when this song was performed on olympics opening ceremony the artistic conception developed from this song was very beautiful
2976374 former olympics theme songs were full of joys and passion this time we took a new way which led to harmony and humanity
2976375 ja ik hoop gewoon dat dat kind slaapt dan hoef ik het ook niet vast te houden als ik het vast moet houden kan ik weer niet bij mijn beschuitje en koffie en dan zeg ik altijd maar dat mijn arm slaapt en dan dump ik het bij iemand anders
2976376 haha maar dat is toch juist schattig een baby op de arm
2976377 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2976378 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2976379 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2976380 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2976381 you told me more about the process than i know
2976382 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2976383 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2976384 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2976385 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2976386 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2976387 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2976388 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2976389 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2976390 indeed the recent spate of bank failures seems remarkable only if one compares it to the unusual period of tranquility that preceded it
2976391 if anything the rate of bank failures is returning to historic norms
2976392 when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things
2976393 welfare of a child is a compelling state interest that a state has not only a right but a duty to protect

2976396 sadly david milliband has nothing of substance to offer he is just too busy preparing for a leadership campaign or preaching environmentalism or just standing there doing nothing while bp has its assets expropriated
2976397 on saturday we noted william hagues response to the crisis in georgia it was to say the least cautious mr hagues intervention contrasts with much more robust statements from other world leaders
2976398 russias actions have certainly been brutal and ott but let us not forget that the south ossetians apparently wish to be independent of georgia and possibly unite with russia

2976405 i examined each of the vulnerabilities that affected windows vista in 2007 to see if the impact was different for standard users 26 out of the 45 vista vulnerabilities if successfully exploited would grant rights as the logged on users at the least this means successful attackers will have to do some more work to gain elevated privileges beyond standard user

2976409 sie wissen dass wir im moment eine lebenssituation der familien haben die durch die teuerung wirklich existenzen bedroht obwohl die leute einer geregelten arbeit nachgehen
2976410 my god is really kind nice generous and love me so much
2976411 ja wir nehmen in der schule gerade den 23 juli 2011 durch und was davor und danach war
2976412 ja wie k nnte man das vergessen ich war da ja fast hautnah dabei also zum gl ck nicht am 23 7 aber bei den protesten danach also begonnen hat das alles mit dem 11 september 2001 du wei t doch was da passiert ist
2976413 richtig es war furchtbar dein papa war damals sieben jahre alt eigentlich h tte er das nicht sehen sollen aber er und oma und ich sa en stundenlang vor dem fernseher er wollte immer da ich das erkl re aber ich konnte es mir selbst nicht erkl ren warum man sowas tut
2976414 richtig nach und nach wurden immer mehr pl tze mit kameras berwacht wir mu ten fingerabdr cke in den reisep ssen hinterlassen die ausweisfotos mu ten biometrisch lesbar sein die computer waren noch nicht so weit deshalb mu ten die bilder einer genau vorgegebenen schablone folgen das war ein gro er aufwand und eigentlich l cherlich ach ja l cheln durftest du auf den fotos nicht das h tte den computer verwirrt
2976415 sp ter mu ten wir das sogar in den personalausweisen so machen
2976416 nichts aber die regierung hat immer nur gesagt da man damit die ausweise nicht mehr f lschen k nnte aber die waren vorher auch schon f lschungssicher genug damit sollten terroristen leichter gefunden werden das w re alls zu unserer sicherheit als argumente hatten sie da ja noch die anschl ge 2004 in madrid und 2005 in london
2976417 eigentlich h tte man es da schon wissen k nnen london war zu der zeit n mlich gepflastert mit kameras
2976418 wir haben im unterricht einen film dar ber gesehen aber ich kann mir das gar nicht vorstellen
2976419 doch wirklich jemand hat mal ausgerechnet da der durchschnittliche londoner an einem tag von 300 kameras erfa t wurde
2976420 und trotzdem gab es anschl ge auf den bus und die u bahn die hatten hinterher zwar tolle berwachungsaufnahmen davon aber sonst hat es nichts gen tzt ich hab ja damals tats chlich geglaubt da diese ganze berwachung uns etwas bringen w rde die politiker haben uns ja eingeredet da wir st ndig in gefahr sind jederzeit k nnte in deutschland eine bombe explodieren oder so etwas
2976421 genau der hat immer noch mehr ideen vorgebracht was man alles tun m te damit deutschland sicher ist wir hatten dann ein gesetz da das bundeskriminalamt computer heimlich durchsuchen konnte da bei verd chtigen kameras installiert werden d rfen um sie zu berwachen und von allen b rgern hat man ein halbes jahr gespeichert von wo aus sie mit wem telefonieren und welche internetseiten sie ansehen
2976422 wir hatten angst wir hatten einfach angst vor den terroristen deshalb gab es dann so kuriose polizeiaktionen da ein wissenschaftler ein jahr beobachtet und dann verhaftet wurde weil er ein paar gleiche w rter in seinen ver ffentlichungen hatte wie eine angebliche terrororganisation er hat sich auch mit ein paar verd chtigen getroffen um soziologische recherchen anzustellen das gen gte um ihn in untersuchungshaft zu stecken und ihn auch danach lange zu berwachen
2976423 das hat ein gericht sp ter auch so gesehen aber zun chst mal hat die staatsanwaltschaft behaupten k nnen das w ren terroristen und hat damit einen haftbefehl f r den wissenschaftler gekriegt
2976424 am anfang hie es noch die fingerabdr cke w rden nur im ausweis oder pa gespeichert und die fotos nur bei den meldebeh rden dann hat man aber eine zentrale datenbank aller meldedaten eingef hrt zun chst ohne die fotos dann hat man die fingerabdr cke auch bei den meldebeh rden gespeichert schlie lich kam das alles in diese zentrale datenbank auf die auch polizei und geheimdienste zugriff hatten es gab immer mal wieder kleine proteste dagegen aber ich dachte das alles w re gut f r die sicherheit und
2976425 nat rlich die terroristen haben mehrere lkws mit sprengstoff in die abfertigungshallen des frankfurter flughafens gelenkt und explodieren lassen das war gerade am beginn der sommerferien in nordrhein westfalen und viele familien mit kindern wollten in den urlaub fliegen etwa 2000 tote aber so schlimm es auch war man mu letztlich leider sagen da es uns sehr geholfen hat
2976426 warum sind die gro en proteste danach aufgekommen es ist doch genau das passiert was die politiker immer gesagt haben
2976427 nein die politiker haben gesagt wenn ihr euch berwachen la t dann seid ihr sicher nach dem anschlag haben sie auch wieder gesagt da mehr berwachung n tig w re und haben eine gendatenbank aller b rger gefordert aber diesmal hat es uns gereicht wir haben endlich begriffen da sie uns die ganze zeit belogen haben und da es echte sicherheit nicht gibt wir sind zu hunderttausenden auf die stra e gegangen auf einer hauptkundgebung in berlin waren ber eine millionen leute erst da hab ich erfahren da es schon die ganze zeit solche proteste gegeben hat aber man hat das nie so richtig wahrgenommen andere haben au erdem briefe und e mails geschrieben bei einer aktion haben ber drei millionen autofahrer f r einen tag ihr nummernschild zugeklebt damit man es nicht lesen konnte die polizei kam mit anzeigenschreiben nicht mehr nach und die angezeigten haben argumentiert da es eine grobe ungerechtigkeit sei da gerade sie von den drei millionen herausgegriffen wurden es gab auch aktionen gegen die privatwirtschaft die hat ja auch alle m glichen daten gesammelt es gab da so rabattkarten bei denen du f r ein paar cent rabatt dein kaufverhalten offengelegt hast man hat dann ber zehn millionen solcher karten gesammelt und vor einer konzernzentrale mit einem laster abgekippt nachdem das in deutschland aufgekommen war sind die proteste nach ganz europa bergeschwappt sogar die engl nder haben sich ihre verbrechensstatistiken mal angesehen und gemerkt da die vielen kameras praktisch keinen effekt hatten und haben auch protestiert dann haben sich auch langsam die politiker daf r interessiert und die regierungen haben st ck f r st ck die sicherheitsgesetze zur ckgenommen gleichzeitig haben sich auch wissenschaftler zu wort gemeldet die uns erkl rt haben da terror nur funktioniert wenn man angst davor hat wir sollten die anschl ge als unf lle ansehen das leben ist ja immer ein risiko und es kann immer irgendwas passieren es hat keinen sinn gerade wegen der winzigen gefahr durch terrorismus zu sterben ein solches aufhebens zu machen
2976428 euch ist das heute klar wir mu ten es erst m hsam lernen
2976429 keine ahnung ich hab mich das oft gefragt ich kanns mir nur so erkl ren da durch diese st ndigen meldungen von terroranschl gen attentatsversuchen terrororganisationen und das gerede von gefahrenraum erh hter terrorgefahr und so weiter wir richtig benebelt waren wir haben nicht mehr dar ber nachgedacht
2976430 oh ja aber das war einmal und ist jetzt gottseidank nur noch geschichte
2976431 yoshiwara quartier des plaisirs et du divertissement de la capitale edo lancienne tokyo
2976432 the illuminati with the exception of japan is very much a white mans game
2976433 i have been promised that not a single person will die if they negotiate in good faith
2976434 can be found in the history books when the manchus invaded china in 1644 the ming army became an underground society aimed at overthrowing the qing manchu and restoring the ming they supported the boxer rebellion but were put down by imperialist powers later with the help of overseas chinese and the japanese imperial family the society managed to overthrow the last emperor and install sun yat sen in his place they last appear in the history books as the green gang and the red gang that fiercely fought the communists in shanghai in the 1940s they were defeated by the communists in 1949 and once again became an underground organization
2976435 since 1949 they have steadily increased their influence throughout china and the rest of the world they have members at the very highest levels of the chinese government but they are by nature anti establishment and are not an official chinese government organization
2976436 the society has deep roots in japan because of the link between yakuza crime gangs and the japanese imperial family
2976437 it must be made very clear though that it is not a crime gang although many members are triad and yakuza members over 2 3 thirds of the members are intellectuals such as university professors researchers and government bureaucrats each member earns their own living and membership in the society is like belonging to an emergency fire brigade their book of rules reads like a book of ethics filled with instructions to do things like help the weak fight injustice help your comrades etc
2976438 they approached me and asked if they could help after i made a speech in tokyo describing the bush regimes use of race specific biological weapons for me it was like a ghost from the history books appearing right in front of me at first i thought of silly things like having them play 911 truth videos in chinatowns around the world however then i remembered the scene from the movie kill bill where uma thurman snatches out her opponents eye i soon realized these people could save the world by directly attacking the eye at the top of the pyramid on the one dollar bill
2976439 think about it the illuminati and their top servants have a total membership of about 10 000 whereas the chinese group has over 6 million members that is 600 to one odds furthermore the 6 million have the names and addresses of the 10 000 while the 10 000 do not know who or where the 6 million are
2976440 below is a brief a summary of the intelligence i have received from sources including former japanese prime ministers senior yakuza gangsters senior japanese freemasons western intelligence agencies etc
2976441 first the illuminati are really inbred families of european and north american traditional aristocracy and banking families
2976442 however there is a big schism in the secret government
2976443 they are also neo nazis who want to reduce the amount of colored people in the world by at least half through disease starvation and war the chinese secret society got wind of this and is preparing to stop them
2976444 i can say with certainty that china russia and india are free
2976445 india kicked them out in ghandis day and they have never been allowed back having liberated themselves after 300 years of illuminati east india company rule they do not intend to let themselves fall under their control again
2976446 there have been many attempts by the illuminati to infiltrate and dominate china
2976447 however germany does not appear on a top secret illuminati power flow chart i have obtained as far as iran is concerned i know they financed ayatollah khomeini and iran appears on the flow chart i have my understanding is they want to provoke a conflict between islam and the west so they can consolidate their control over the muslim and christian worlds before finishing world conquest by taking over china and india
2976448 so far i have told the illuminati that they are no longer allowed to murder japanese politicians i now plan to extend this protection to all politicians in the west if the illuminati assassinate or attempt to assassinate ron paul barak obama or any politician may god have mercy on their souls
2976449 since i am a peace loving laid back canadian suddenly put in a situation of great responsibility i feel i must act as a servant of the weakest people and creatures on the planet
2976450 i do believe we now have a real chance to end the new world order and start the new age the new age would be one where war poverty and environmental destruction would only be found in the history books
2976451 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore

2976467 when obama met with acorn leaders in november he reminded them of his history with acorn and his beginnings in illinois as a project vote organizer a nonprofit focused on voter rights and education
2976468 raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation to make sure that full time workers can earn a living wage that allows them to raise their families and pay for basic needs such as food transportation and housing

2976470 they have approached the man who was armed with the firearm she said
2976471 they have challenged him to put the firearm down and hes turned and raised the firearm and shot himself
2976472 dont do it for the money do it because you love it
2976473 it took me 5 brand new cars to realise they werent making me happy as soon as i parked them for the first time i thought what now
2976474 now a 75 gap between cigarette sales in the city and cigarette consumption
2976475 settle very soon perhaps in the next couple of weeks
2976476 what the judge instructed the jury was that they could only find him guilty of a war crime if he intended to aim these weapons at innocent civilians and that it wouldnt be a crime if he attempted to use them against u s forces but thats not what international law says and not what the geneva conventions tell us if he intended to aim them at u s forces because he was an illegal combatant he wasnt wearing uniform or following the laws of war he could still be guilty of a war crime
2976477 it was mercy on my part but i never thought about having those little kids jailed says cathy the courts werent the place for them that would just take them downstream even further it would be better hopefully to put these restrictions on them and see if they carry through with this
2976478 weve been living with the illusion that having the right to vote overseas makes a difference
2976479 fosters engagement rejects arrogance and creates opportunities for dialogue rather than limits or shuts them down
2976480 because israel is not prepared to face a second holocaust
2976481 this is my message to my house democratic colleagues we know that a number of them are with us
2976482 we are going to call on them today to cross that picket line to take a stand in their district and publicly call on the speaker of the house to bring this congress back
2976483 i am confident that right this minute there are at least 50 democrats who would vote for an energy bill they would go for offshore drilling on the outer continental shelf ocs for 50 miles out
2976484 let me just add that i know for a fact there are at least 15 or 20 congressmen who are dying just dying to get it a drilling bill on the floor there are others who are just frothing at the mouth because they cant get a vote on the floor
2976485 we have a bipartisan majority for a first time in years that would support more drilling thats why we are doing this
2976486 my perception i am not aware of aware of a single house democrat who has either expressed publicly into her district that the speaker should call a special session back or has indicated any interest at all in coming back to capitol hill
2976487 theres no such thing youd better ask those who say hes going to resign
2976488 we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2976489 actions with regard to the civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2976490 this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2976491 unless russia is stopped tomorrow russian tanks might enter any european capital
2976492 that these two nations are and will remain sovereign and independent states
2976493 not to allow deaths of our compatriots to remain unpunished
2976494 from the international legal perspective the russian action could be described as a humanitarian intervention
2976495 the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not
2976496 if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
2976497 require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control
2976498 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2976499 it contained words that led some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2976500 however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2976501 why on earth is the bush administration trying to discourage doctors and clinics from providing contraception to women who need it
2976502 any entity taking federal funds has to comply with federal laws
2976503 to do anything less would be irresponsible we do think there should be regulations
2976504 it appears that the interaction of the abog bulletin for 2008 maintenance of certification with the acog ethics report would force physicians to violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionable actions or risk losing their board certification
2976505 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion
2976506 i wrote to the acog and abog protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same
2976507 not only are there clear provisions in three separate laws protecting federally funded health care providers right of conscience but doing otherwise undermines the most fundamental moral underpinning of freedom of expression and action
2976508 i asked that regulations be drafted which would enforce these long standing laws protecting a medical practitioners conscience rights
2976509 has earned a very large role in the future of the republican party
2976510 land emphasized that he does not make political endorsement and would not say who he would support
2976511 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2976512 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2976513 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2976514 how about just giving brown 50 000 osteen can well afford it
2976515 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
2976516 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
2976517 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2976518 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him
2976519 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2976520 this case carries inevitably a prison sentence no doubt about it
2976521 i am going to grant him bail but it must be on the clear understanding what the sentence will be
2976522 there was a long protracted series of text messages that culminated in the offence
2976523 it is a series of messages followed by a series of threats
2976524 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2976525 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2976526 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2976527 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2976528 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2976529 ive been building towards the games for a long time and ive showed with this bronze medal that im on great form
2976530 ive got a slightly more imposing build and a more solid engine than my rivals
2976531 i think i can do well in the time trial it will be hard but the course suits me
2976532 the other day at the airport i was 40 60 against now im 60 40 well see how i pull up tomorrow

2976536 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2976537 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2976538 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2976557 they are held to higher standards they are expected to be better than adequate to prove they deserved being hired being average is perceived by some observers as failure rather than taking time and effort to train minorities and everyone else managers are schooled in the sink or swim method when a white person sinks its just more driftwood when a person of color sinks its an indictment of the whole race

2976562 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
2976563 if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
2976564 have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee

2976602 t he existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies

2976660 every effort was made to resuscitate him however we do regret to inform everyone that we did lose one of our members today
2976661 it was not a traumatic injury he wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down

2976674 we are trying to explore whether we might use only lahore and karachi and take a decision soon
2976675 it was a very constructive meeting very informative the attitude and willingness of the pakistan government officials to implement security measures was very positive
2976676 we all shared the same concerns we have to ensure the safety of the players the media and the concerns were all common

2976702 i dont think ive ever scripted 10 plays in a row since peewee football i know we never did at wisconsin or at the philadelphia eagles
2976703 thats a big area of improvement that we need to see this year
2976704 we obviously do plenty of work on running the football here in training camp and one of the things that our team needs to be better at is throwing the football protecting adrian and his growth
2976705 obviously we needed to take a look at all those protections and route running and i dont need to see peterson run a zone another time
2976706 there were some things that were pleasant and some things that need work but thats what its all about you just can point to the obvious and weve got things to come back and work on the offense did some good things but defensively we werent doing much
2976707 he was consistent and i thought he had a good spot on most of those throws i thought he obviously knew what was happening to him and you just want to see that standard of performance over and over again
2976708 well ive said all the way along that defensive end
2976709 we had the fumble that caused a touchdown for them that cost seven points and tight end jim kleinsasser had that false start which we ended up overcoming for a touchdown but we can play more disciplined and certainly improve on that end too
2976710 i was pleased with where were at in the return game and the coverage game as well
2976711 i thought they did some good things and great stuff for our young guys to teach from we didnt have any first teamers at all on any of our kick teams because you want to look at those younger guys so you kind of hold on and hope they do well and they actually gave a pretty good accounting but a lot of things to correct
2976712 jag har dragit skam och van ra ver min arbetsplats
2976713 i kept telling the trainer and coach brad childress that its just a sprain
2976714 i was trying to be positive deep down i knew it was a lot more serious than that its tough its a bad feeling its not how you want to leave the game
2976715 its a tough situation because i really like heath and think hes a great person
2976716 i tore my acl so i know how that whole experience is and i know how it makes you feel i feel terrible for him
2976717 i spoke to chad several times the last few days hes been helping me out with it hes been a big help as far as being there for me he knows what im going through
2976718 what kills me is you prepare all year for these games and then not being able to play is the most depressing part
2976719 i was in better shape faster and stronger than ive been since ive been here thats the toughest thing its kind of a freak injury its real disappointing because i had high hopes for this year for myself and the team
2976720 i know the other guys dont feel themselves fortunate but its an opportunity and so well see who it is that steps in and takes the lead
2976721 somebody will step up whether it be a linebacker a defensive back or another defensive lineman im not sure who right now
2976722 were probably not going to make a roster move and sign another linebacker were probably going to let it play out with the guys who are in house right now

2976740 the dominant driver is the dollar strengthening if it heads higher then of course industrial metals will stay on the defensive
2976741 concerns about global growth are ongoing consumers are sniffing at these prices but they will take to the sidelines if prices start to fall again
2976742 as underlying metals demand in china is still healthy we believe this will give an incentive for chinese buyers to gradually increase imports

2976753 is prioritizing their own interests without taking into consideration the interests of the tribal community their beliefs their cultural life their connection to the land this decision of the highest court of our land will definitely have affects on the indigenous tribes ecology and biodiversity mining forest land water resources of the entire region environmental degradation caused by development projects damages the surrounding land
2976754 it has only reinforced the conviction of the indigenous peoples that their voice in their interests are not considered their life and their social security mean little to the authorities
2976755 when the government drafts plans they systematically declare that tribals and those alienated will benefit but that rarely works out
2976756 the illiteracy rate of the tribal is very high so they are not even qualified for the selection process
2976757 outsiders will flood these areas depriving the original inhabitant of every opportunity that may have otherwise come their way with these projects
2976758 the first world countries conserve their own resources and deplete the natural resourses of other nations without conscience of their damaging effects on the most vulnerable indigenous peoples of the world the government shouts aloud that the tribal will be rehabilitated but our poor indigenous people displaced by so called development projects rarely make this transition from dependence on the forests and other natural resources those who lose land to development projects and those whose land is alienated to immigrants or encroachers are impoverished the law treats land their livelihood and the centre of their identity and culture as a commodity to be sold or leased to the highest bidder
2976759 in my post gun buyback misfires i pointed out that a gun buybacks encourage people to turn in old low quality guns that are unlikely to be used in any case and b gun buybacks can encourage people to buy and hold more guns because the buyback is a form of insurance if the gun gets old or stops working you can sell it to the police
2976760 still my guess is that unless the price the government pays for the clunkers is very high the majority of vehicles that are turned in will not have been driven much if at all indeed i suspect one of the most visible responses to this program will be a new market for mechanics fixing up cars that dont run at all just enough so that they can be driven to the governments lot to collect the cash the biggest problem with this policy however is the way it distorts long run incentives lets say the rules of the program say that a car must be at least fifteen years old to qualify for a big government subsidy to scrap it this gives powerful incentives to people with twelve year old cars they were planning on scrapping to keep driving them for three more years to collect the government bounty instead of reducing the number of clunkers on the road this program could actually lead to an increase

2976786 a significant part of the operation to force the georgian authorities to make peace in south ossetia has been concluded tskhinvali is under the control of a reinforced russian peacekeeping contingent
2976787 according to information from peacekeepers in south ossetia georgia continues to use military force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
2976788 we are not crossing the de facto border thats our key principle russian peacekeeping troops have received no orders to invade georgian territory
2976789 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2976790 he is seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
2976791 the military operations that we saw on saturday and since then including air and missile attacks have no relation to and go well beyond the cis peacekeeping operation
2976792 the fact that russia is now going even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia bombing sites near to the georgian capital of tbilisi the fact that russia has mobilised at least part of the black sea fleet off the coast of georgia is entirely deplorable russian military behaviour
2976793 there cannot be a military solution to this it is absolutely clear

2976796 it was simply a wonderful afternoons football the fact that 9 000 spectators turned up here to see a fifth division side speaks volumes about german football
2976797 you can always find something to criticise we could have scored a couple of more goals up forward and at the back we should not have conceded three but those are just the finer details which we can continue to work on
2976798 on the whole we can consider ourselves to be quite satisfied we wanted to set things straight from the outset and we managed to do that with a 4 1 lead going into the break the game was already decided our switching from defence to attack and from attack back to defence needs to be better but we still have a few days to work on that
2976799 stella went absolutely ballistic when she saw it a source told
2976800 i have never seen her so angry she hit the roof and said that she planned to sue
2976801 she didnt see any proofs she just saw the campaign its a monumental cock up
2976802 i think you wrote once that you did kabbalah is it really a cult or what is it all about
2976803 where did you grow up and what lessons did you take with you from that town city etc
2976804 what was your most embarrassing moments from grade school or middle school
2976805 what is your favorite brand of coffee where is your favorite place to drink coffee is there any other caffeine you crave soda energy drinks crack
2976806 the more you resort to violence the more the likelihood of depriving the same people for whose interest you think you are fighting
2976807 food is made fresh to order meaning a wait for up to 1 hour
2976808 where does that leave us if we have spent these years without using the oil to develop our areas what would happen when oil is irrelevant
2976809 in the past 80 years terrorists or rebels have become presidents and prime ministers
2976810 there is need for a new vehicle to manage the new resources not existing government agencies
2976811 first and foremost we must get the form right in front of that vociferous crowd and take it from there
2976812 well be looking to win all the home games and finish further up
2976813 attack wise we didnt score as many tries as wed like so were building on that especially with the new laws it might be a quicker more attack orientated game
2976814 were doing a lot of work to tighten that area up obviously if youre not conceding tries it makes it easier to win
2976815 if we can start well then we could end up third or fourth
2976816 he picks up small boys and girls and puts his hands upon them
2976817 how would this fanatical hammerer of homosexuals leader of a bunch of annoying bigots have interpreted events in palestine a couple of thousand years ago

2976826 if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem
2976827 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
2976828 when you see knol pages rank high they are there because they have earned their position
2976829 our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for
2976830 for that reason we are not interested in owning or creating content
2976831 our job which is to organize that information kicks in
2976832 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
2976833 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users
2976834 provides a framework for growth at verizon and a good standard of living with careers for our members

2976836 met our goals to protect the retirees who helped to build this company and ensure future jobs for union members
2976837 its consumers looking for more and more convenience and companies trying to get smart about how they can better reach out
2976838 if customers arent coming to them theyre bringing their services to the customer
2976839 ten years ago it was the lawn service then came food delivery and dry cleaning pickup and delivery
2976840 a lot of that trend is a result of school cutbacks on physical education or music programs
2976841 the animals had to be transported to the hospital sit in the waiting room then be dragged into an exam room for someone to poke and prod them before being kicked out the door
2976842 i thought there had to be a better way to do this
2976843 i had a hard time finding a perfect match between location and community
2976844 the initial investment required to open a brick and mortar shop was pretty high
2976845 taking the risk of having to pull people in to one location
2976846 i liken this to the equivalent of walking naked through a room with a bag over your head while somebody peers from the balcony above you
2976847 were really looking for edges and contrasts and things that look like they dont belong
2976848 theres probably a six month delay between the last images that have been publicly published and likely what the companies have in place now
2976849 in the end i dont think there will be a big difference
2976850 if theyre really worried about radiation they shouldnt get on a plane in the first place
2976851 if youre going to go from new york to los angeles you dont really have a choice about flying
2976852 but perhaps you should have a choice about going through these x ray machines or not
2976853 they ought to run that experiment where they show the passengers what the pictures look like
2976854 if they put it that way do you want to go through the naked machine or do you want a pat down it would be different
2976855 today were calling on industry higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the web
2976856 you dont have to be a software engineer to get involved and you dont have to program everyone is welcome to participate
2976857 but with a problem like designing the browser of the future we werent even sure where to start
2976858 the evolution of the browser seemed to be intimately intertwined with the evolution of the web and to some extent the underlying internet itself plus we had to account for trends in general computing technologies smaller faster powerful more connected and ubiquitous devices enabling new kinds of interactions and applications
2976859 the main feature request from users was the ability to not just speak to twitter but also to listen to their friends twitter messages via their phone twitterfone now enables two and multi way conversations on twitter using any phone while youre on the move
2976860 it didnt try to maximize the win and just played the most sure way to win its like a machine
2976861 the cost currently stands at several million pounds but it is too early to give a definitive sum
2976862 sadly despite all our warnings and those of the medway ports authority harbour master and the maritime and coastguard agency some foolhardy people decided to protest from the water trying to reach kingsnorth from various points on the medway ignoring the prohibition made by the harbour master on the grounds of safety
2976863 goods identified with cheap logos become the brunt of regular name calling and bullying the geek is isolated
2976864 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
2976865 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
2976866 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2976867 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2976868 we are worried these pressures will further intensify as schools and colleges look for more help from commercial sponsors to provide it sports and science equipment teaching materials and food
2976869 advertising and marketing are just a small part of a much wider range of influences on children in todays consumer society childrens attitudes and values are primarily formed by the culture they live in and their personal contacts their families and friends
2976870 the advertising industry in the uk takes a responsible approach and there are strong and effective advertising controls that require special care to be taken as regards children
2976871 conditions at the trials end the jury acquitted hamdan on the most serious charge conspiring to commit terrorist acts and found him guilty of supporting terrorism the prosecution urged a 30 year sentence but the jury gave hamdan what accounting for time served is just five months in prison in plain english the prosecution got whipped in a system that according to critics had been rigged in its favor even so the outcome in one case cannot erase the systems flaws they too were on display the judge navy capt refused to suppress a key admission made by hamdan even though his lawyers said it was coerced no one can judge the standards allred used because all but a few paragraphs of his five page ruling were blacked out testimony by two witnesses for hamdan also were transparency a hallmark of the u s justice system is being jettisoned just when its needed most the government could remedy that problem in upcoming trials by using secrecy only as a last resort the system faces another thorny test in the months ahead when hamdan
2976872 the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth

2976882 this is great news for gps colour graphics the certification demonstrates our commitment to sustainability fsc certified paper tells you that the recycled or virgin fibre content of the paper comes from sources that meet fsc international standards
2976883 gps colour graphics is now the first and only commercial printing company in northern ireland to have been certified with the fsc accreditation
2976884 our clients can now rest assured that by choosing gps for their fsc print projects they are guaranteed that the paper comes from sustainable sources and has met the highest possible social and environmental standards in forestry
2976885 by using fsc certified products gps and its clients are providing incentives for responsible forestry and can be confident that their print projects are not contributing to the destruction of the worlds forests
2976886 one of the main benefits to clients is that the fsc label can appear on literature that is printed on fsc paper meaning that our clients can demonstrate their commitment to the environment
2976887 we felt the time was right for gps to work towards fsc accreditation and to continue to build on our existing green credentials
2976888 we have invested heavily in our environmental policy and it has meant that the entire workforce have had to sign up to our approach
2976889 the fsc status has meant that every member of staff have had to be trained in the chain of custody process in order to verify the product has come from approved sources
2976890 whilst we note that the imc has been asked to prepare a special report on paramilitary structures including the current status of the ira we will be making our own assessment and using our own security contacts
2976891 the briefings we receive on a regular basis establish the extent to which the ira has progressed with the dismantling of its paramilitary structures
2976892 it remains our position that the army council must leave the stage and that the ira should no longer function in any respect
2976893 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005
2976894 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2976895 the final ending of the provisional army council may be difficult to call
2976896 they have not formally disbanded but they arent doing what they were set out to do and they arent a security threat

2976900 an agreement was formally concluded between telkom cwu and sacu
2976901 such strike actions could cause a backlog in installations and a general delay in repairs
2976902 the company further agreed that this 11 5percent will be extended to all monetary values including medical aid and standby allowances
2976903 but we are not necessarily happy because we initially wanted an 11 6percent increase but we will engage the company again towards the end of the year to discuss salary increases

2976915 as we continue to expand our operations in brazil it is critical for us to rely on a strategic partner like global crossing
2976916 were benefiting from global crossings high quality services which provide us the reliability performance and security that we need to maintain the high quality of our communications activities
2976917 were very pleased that norskan offshore selected global crossing to support their growth in brazil
2976918 we strive to provide the best services and solutions to our customers so that they can focus on their core business
2976919 we completed the rollout of metro rings roughly 12 months ago
2976920 what we are in the process of rolling out now is the metro access layer which enables the customer to link to our network hence the term fibre to the kerb
2976921 it runs with the existing streets and is laid in the kerb to provide access across an entire area rather than just connecting major hubs
2976922 essentially what this means is that the infrastructure is already available and therefore we can connect customers in much faster turnaround times
2976923 the benefit to the customer is faster deployment more bandwidth and a fully scalable service to meet their requirements even when their needs change
2976924 it also means that our services are not limited to big organisations smaller companies are moving over to our network because it is already available in their metros and therefore quick to deploy
2976925 while many might feel that there is risk in taking this approach as all clients might not sign up with us we feel that we would rather have the infrastructure in place to be ready for them when they do make the move
2976926 music is critical to our store environment and trusonic has provided a flexible custom playlist thats relevant and appropriate for our demographic

2976928 j amp ms unique understanding of the retail environment and trusonics sophisticated background music and messaging environment technology are a natural fit we appreciate that johnston amp murphy chose trusonic for all it does well the depth of our available music catalog the availability of independent and emerging artists customer service that responds quickly and effectively and our singular understanding of their branded environment

2976935 plaintiffs trial lawyers fought hard against the central florida commuter rail solution sen siplin was a vocal advocate for that project in an effort to bring relief to the regions transportation system
2976936 a part of the bill could have meant less money in trial lawyer pockets is that the reason
2976937 siplin has fought to lower our property insurance rates and is a strong voice for his district in tallahassee
2976938 beware of the negative things youll be hearing in the coming weeks paid for in secret by plaintiffs trial lawyers
2976939 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

2976941 simbol mining promises to be the lowest cost producer of lithium in the world with the added and significant benefit of doing so with a cleaner greener approach
2976942 the company leverages a strong technical team from lawrence livermore llnl using proven separation technologies
2976943 with the closure of this new financing we can complete development of the processes needed to produce lithium from brines and effluent streams in an environmentally conscious manner
2976944 although lithium is our first metal we see tremendous opportunity to apply our technologies to the extraction of other metals
2976945 it is actually a disincentive yes it works very well for people who need to get somewhere quick and pay for it
2976946 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2976947 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
2976948 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
2976949 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
2976950 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2976951 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2976952 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2976953 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2976954 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2976955 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2976956 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2976957 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2976958 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2976959 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2976998 my sweetheart if you want to build a family a faithful one you can never build it on what allah has stated as wrong and proven false by the way rasulullah has taught us a happy and blessed family come from allah and you dont even have anything to defend it as blessed if the first step you make is by stepping into what he has prohibited you cant have a happy family if allah doesnt help you so and you must know in every family that stands until their dying day they have allah on their side you cant expect him to help you if you did the wrong step from the very beginning
2976999 its not me who want you to make a decision like this but allah tells you so

2977024 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2977025 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2977026 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2977027 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2977028 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2977029 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2977030 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2977031 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2977032 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2977033 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2977034 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2977035 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2977036 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2977037 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2977038 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2977039 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality

2977103 facua espera una sanci n ejemplarizante por parte de las autoridades competentes y lamenta el desprecio de ryanair hacia los derechos de los usuarios y la legislaci n vigente
2977104 por razones que no incumben de forma alguna a los pasajeros ni est n legitimadas por la ley
2977105 desde el momento en el que una compa a a rea emite el t tulo de transporte independiente de quien haya sido el intermediario existe una obligaci n contractual entre el transportista y el pasajero
2977106 facua duda si el motivo por el que la aerol nea ha cancelado las reservas a trav s de las agencias es que stas cometen irregularidades como asegura ryanair o que le est n suponiendo la p rdida de negocios como por ejemplo la contrataci n de seguros que aparecen preseleccionados al comprar billetes en su p gina web sin aclarar que son opcionales una pr ctica que motiv las denuncias de facua el pasado enero contra ryanair y otras ocho aerol neas y agencias

2977110 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
2977111 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me

2977125 thats why he has played all the time the coach has the ability to make a change in the team but with ronaldinho he doesnt do it
2977126 and its important for the tournament that ronaldinho is playing all the time
2977127 it turned out that ronaldinho made new zealand pay for his low key performance against belgium
2977128 he probably looked a wee bit out of condition against belgium in the first game
2977129 but belgium played quite a solid game particularly against him so he didnt have the space and time that he might have had against us
2977130 but i thought last night he was probably a level up
2977131 im ready for it friday and saturday and i am done
2977132 i am more nervous this time because of the injury
2977133 there was a little bit of a panic in my mind when i suffered the injury as it really hurt
2977134 however when i was laying on the ground it the pain eased up a bit
2977135 i was really upset because the same thing happened in 2004 and even though i was still at college i thought i could make the olympic team memories came flooding back
2977136 my hamstring is 100 percent ive had four weeks to recover undergo rehabilitation and light training
2977137 i am not at all concerned that i havent got a race under my belt i would rather be 100 percent than risk it by being 88 percent fit
2977138 i have had a chance in practice to see where i am at and that was a confidence booster
2977139 i am fully confident that the hamstring will hold up through four rounds of the 100m i have no aches and no twitches
2977140 when i feel nervous i call my mother she doesnt know a lot about track and field but she knows how to calm me down
2977141 i believe that i dont really have to put on an image or swagger

2977198 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2977199 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2977200 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2977201 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2977202 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2977205 people chose to go to their local shop rather than driving endless kilometres to go to a big supermarket
2977206 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2977207 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2977208 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2977222 the key to defeating the initiative is to keep it off the ballot in the first place
2977223 if you give me your signatures well leave you alone
2977224 strategy of pushing propositions likely to draw conservatives to the polls has faltered as republicans face mishaps in drafting measures and a more aggressive opposition
2977225 when oklahoma officials arrested jacob on charges of violating a state law that bars nonresidents from circulating petitions so jacob is sitting out this campaign
2977226 ca a craqu derri re ca ma fait un peu peur je me mets en position de d fense et en m me temps je tends le bras il ma fait une cl javais mal au cou mal au bras je nen pouvais plus javais un peu les toiles
2977227 paul jacob is a long time lieutenant for ultra libertarian causes like legislative and judicial term limits strict tax caps that bankrupt state government and the removal of land use policies that protect the environment while allowing for growth
2977228 jacob is also the director of citizens in charge a group he uses to advocate for the expansion of ballot initiatives so he can take his ballot ideas to all 50 states
2977229 bisc has tracked jacobs ties to secretive organizations with deep pockets such as howie rich funded americans for limited government that prefer to operate outside of the public eye
2977230 in 2007 a multi county grand jury in oklahoma indicted jacob and two others for their involvement in the 2005 petition drive to put the taxpayer bill of rights tabor initiative on the ballot they were charged with conspiracy to defraud voters by hiring out of state signature gatherers against oklahoma state laws
2977231 as a result of the indictment jacob has launched a national tour to highlight the so called legal threats to the citizens initiative movement around the country he is now traveling around the country testifying against common sense signature gathering reforms and claiming victimization at the hands of the oklahoma attorney general
2977232 virtually guarantee s that there will be less of it
2977233 this will be a long fight now a little longer
2977234 but we are prepared with the help of family friends and supporters to battle as long and hard as we must the continuance requested by the attorney generals office means only a slight delay as this politically motivated prosecution unfortunately will continue we take comfort in knowing that we will ultimately get our day in court and we will be vindicated
2977235 they beat us up pretty good the last time we played them twins first baseman justin morneau said
2977236 were lucky we came out of here with two out of three wins the way we played

2977241 it is perfectly legal for opponents of a petition to solicit money and manpower from out of state and sure enough public sector unions opposed to the 1995 tabor initiative recruited people from outfits like the oregon based voter education project an offshoot of the afl cio that specializes in countering signature drives they also set up web sites that advertised the location of signature gathers and urged their members to harass them
2977242 were charged with enforcing the laws that are on the books
2977243 meant to ensure an open and honest process of putting issues on the ballot
2977244 merely doing what was necessary to put term limits on state ballots
2977245 we want them to do the right thing i think in the future we will probably have more of an auditing effort because we want to be even more careful that there arent forged signatures
2977246 had just been duped they were offered 50 and for some of these people 50 is a lot of money and asked to go to a notary public
2977247 general edmondsons stated practice is to avoid commenting on pending legislation
2977248 it is very disappointing that in this case he is deviating from his usual practice
2977249 spoke briefly with jacob before he left for the airport he seems confident that he and his co defendants will not be convicted for exercising their first amendment rights but he mostly wants his story to be told
2977250 you can slice it and dice it any way you want it it cost us the game
2977251 weve got joe nathan coming in there in the ninth and you know how well he has pitched this year ill take that one for the team for sure
2977252 chopper back to the mound and we are not covering the bag
2977253 he doesnt miss that high that was at his face you want to go inside and knock a guy off you do it at his face hit him up high or at his face they can say what they want to say
2977254 if she has a two day labor or whatever i said take care of your wife
2977255 one of the more thoughtful people in the petition trade critical of its problems and clear eyed about its limitations
2977256 built heavily around criticism from the liberal progressive ballot initiative strategy center which is quick to label signature gathering as corrupt at least in cases where it opposes the cause in question
2977257 were generally not fans of task forces but the complexity of this issue warranted such an approach
2977258 a democratic legislator who wants to remain anonymous for fear of political retribution has confided to me that attorney general edmondson has lobbied against bills to reform the petition process
2977259 why what is edmonson afraid of what are these democratic senators afraid of
2977260 this bill would simply allow legislators to find out the facts about the petition process and to discuss possible solutions how can anyone be against having more information
2977261 is the constitutional grant of authority to ban mere possession of cocaine today
2977262 blockers scream at petition signers calling them names and hover menacingly over them making them feel threatened and intimidated
2977263 theyre literally behaving like thugs out there theyve torn up our petitions followed us home
2977264 ban non residents from helping to circulate a petition require anyone who is paid to circulate a petition to register with the government charge people a fee for petitioning force those petitioning to give personal information like home address even home phone number and tell the state and because it is a public record also tell the blockers the measures with which one is associated
2977265 i live in a world thats a little more frightening than most of us would like but im holding up well and feel good about pushing this fight and defending ourselves and defending the citizen initiative process
2977266 oklahomas blanket ban on nonresident petition circulators offends the first amendment and the structure of the federal union it is directed at a phantom interstate menace the presumed endemic dishonesty of nonresidents who wish to travel to oklahoma to associate with and speak for local citizens whose own voices for political change are otherwise too faint or dispersed these are the citizens for whom many states in a wave of populism preserved the right to initiative referendum and recall they have no eloquent champions in the press powerful sponsors among local political elites or brigades of party or union supporters they cannot grasp traditional republican levers which have been co opted by the powers that be their reform would be stifled without a direct appeal to thinking voters
2977267 limiting circulators to oklahoma residents simply limits the number of people who can commit fraud it does not prevent it in any serious way
2977268 violating an arbitrary registration rule should not be condoned of course but it does not render signatures fraudulent and is thus unrelated to maintaining the integrity of the initiative and referenda process itself moreover if an out of state circulator violates some rule by failing to register with the state or failing to sign an affidavit the narrowly tailored remedy is to not count the affected signatures not preclude all out of state circulators
2977269 oklahoma has a compelling interest in maintaining the integrity reliability and efficiency of its system of direct democracy and the protest procedures designed to police the system
2977270 the ballot initiative strategy center how it promotes big labors political strategy
2977271 so term limits and ballot initiatives are complementary equal parts of your approach to government reform
2977272 just because i think term limits are the best thing since sliced bread doesnt mean i would give them priority over the initiative process thats the safeguard thats what gives citizens the ability to go over the heads of politicians
2977273 since youre here in california you know im going to ask you about proposition 13
2977274 that changed everything here it allowed a lot of people to keep their houses
2977275 but it was enormously beneficial outside california it showed the possibilities of the initiative process
2977276 so shes making sure to have her wedding before we go to trial tentatively scheduled for february 2009 so i can walk her down the aisle
2977277 ok 3 did nothing wrong and in so doing shows that ag drew edmondsons prosecution has no rational basis if political motivations are ruled out
2977278 for whatever reason our state is trying to prosecute these people simply because some officeholders dont like the issue that mr jacob was trying to put on the ballot
2977279 it would be a waste of taxpayer money to pay another attorney to review what the ethics commission has already received
2977280 to cripple the initiative process is part of a nationwide effort by government employee unions and their friendly politicians to protect their gravy train from the citizens they seek to neutralize citizens who campaign for clean government just as they are trying to do to paul jacob in oklahoma
2977281 i think i should indicate why i am here in birmingham since you have been influenced by the view which argues against outsiders coming in
2977282 warn that voter rights of initiative are under attack in many of the 24 states that give voters that power including washington
2977283 someone called it today a solution in search of a problem
2977284 it is the purposeful desire to create a problem because this legislation puts every proponent of an initiative at risk
2977285 jacob a virginian faces felony charges in oklahoma for having helped an initiative campaign to limit tax increases in that state in 2005 and he has called himself and fellow defendants the oklahoma 3 the trio faces up to 10 years in prison for allegedly conspiring to violate a state law that bars out of state residents from working as paid signature gatherers on initiatives
2977286 taking responsibility for how you respond to circumstances and keeping your anger levels low these are major leaps toward a life of love
2977287 the gap between expectations and reality is like a drain through which we lose our joy
2977288 even the turkish often rbn controlled server as9121 ttnet is now being blocked via comstar we understand via colleagues in istanbul the turkish authorities are trying to regain control of these servers and provide direct routing to georgia
2977289 i dont think ive ever scripted 10 plays in a row since peewee football i know we never did at wisconsin or at the philadelphia eagles
2977290 thats a big area of improvement that we need to see this year
2977291 we obviously do plenty of work on running the football here in training camp and one of the things that our team needs to be better at is throwing the football protecting adrian and his growth
2977292 obviously we needed to take a look at all those protections and route running and i dont need to see peterson run a zone another time
2977293 there were some things that were pleasant and some things that need work but thats what its all about you just can point to the obvious and weve got things to come back and work on the offense did some good things but defensively we werent doing much
2977294 he was consistent and i thought he had a good spot on most of those throws i thought he obviously knew what was happening to him and you just want to see that standard of performance over and over again
2977295 well ive said all the way along that defensive end
2977296 we had the fumble that caused a touchdown for them that cost seven points and tight end jim kleinsasser had that false start which we ended up overcoming for a touchdown but we can play more disciplined and certainly improve on that end too
2977297 i was pleased with where were at in the return game and the coverage game as well
2977298 i thought they did some good things and great stuff for our young guys to teach from we didnt have any first teamers at all on any of our kick teams because you want to look at those younger guys so you kind of hold on and hope they do well and they actually gave a pretty good accounting but a lot of things to correct
2977299 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
2977300 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
2977301 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
2977302 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
2977303 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
2977304 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
2977305 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset
2977306 following a disciplinary hearing held on friday after a detailed investigation the senior manager whose hospital laptop computer was stolen has been dismissed from the trust with immediate effect
2977307 the unanimous decision of the disciplinary panel sends out a clear statement about how seriously the trust takes security and patient confidentiality
2977308 i again apologise for the distress the theft of this laptop may have caused suffolk homes
2977309 we had some issues with customer complaints dealing with the speed of our bus drivers
2977310 from that point of view its a positive because the message has got through to slow down
2977311 we were very open with the union that we would post in our divisions exactly where were going to be so drivers know that its not a question of hiding behind bushes
2977312 some drivers take pride in their jobs and try to make up time and the only way you can do that on a bus is to speed

2977330 the harmonies were sweet the arrangement was beautiful i felt the joy in my heart the choir i am saving tonight is revelation
2977331 because their performance was innovative brave imaginative and they have the potential to go all the way the choir im going to save is sense of sound
2977332 they raised their game and they lifted me spiritually it was amazing they gave me the tingle factor on the back of the neck
2977333 the choir and it has been incredibly difficult to make this decision but the choir that i will be saving this evening is revelation
2977334 well its a really weird experience because it felt like being in a little aeroplane and going in and out of the clouds and occasionally id come out into some blue sunshine and the rest of the time it was just a little bit foggy
2977335 and i felt that every time the tune came back it needed something different i liked it when the tune was with the men that was really a thrilling sound but the rest of the time was a little bit uninspiring
2977336 i thought all the elements were there but it just didnt gel for me this week
2977337 in the verses the three girls continuously sang in unison and nothing else happened in the verses so it became a bit monotonous for me and im not used to having that with you guys youve risen the bar before and i feel youve dropped it this week
2977338 everything which youve done so far has been incredible for me this felt a little bit like that difficult second album where youre not quite sure what youre going to put on it so you stick something on that you think theyre going to like
2977339 i felt for one moment there that you werent quite making the connection that you normally make with us it was almost like you were doing it for yourselves
2977340 rex is a jerk i trusted him and he betrayed me i should have known he had a girlfriend

2977345 where she came from and why i had missed her music all these years
2977346 i do my time in the eye of the lens so some loser can launch his rocket what do i care if they think theyre my friends when their money is in my pocket you can call me a victim you can call it a sin you can stand on your stump and shout it but its mans world that were livin in and i dont want to talk about it
2977347 people round here dont know what it means to suffer at the hands of our american dreams they turn their backs on the grisly scenes traced to the privileged sons they got their god they got their guns got their armies and the chosen ones but well all be burning in the same big sun when the great correction comes
2977348 as a way to console myself as i grieve the devastation of the human and natural world
2977349 finally about two weeks ago i got a package in the mail from rick containing the two photos beautifully signed by all three with a silver pen red shea died on monday june 9 2008
2977350 he made me understand that music must be more than cotton candy for the ears
2977351 something different than that young boy who grew up in a small town in north carolina
2977352 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
2977353 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
2977354 he just fell into a trap that we can all fall into
2977355 i would treat him no differently but he would be snubbed by some people
2977356 no matter what your party affiliation if someone from your town is successful you hate
2977357 to be involved in something like this my heart goes out to his wife
2977358 that would really be a power trip that really would
2977359 i think almost anyone would kind of lose sight of reality
2977360 if he ran for political office again id vote for him
2977361 he should have been man enough from the start to say i done it

2977366 now dealers can have real time market pricing and historical sales performance data in a single solution at a significantly lower cost than any other product on the market

2977368 the latest inventorypro enhancements that give us the capability to view real time pricing in the surrounding market area are cutting edge
2977369 these new features coupled with sales history auction data and appraisal tools that are already available in inventorypro are just what we need to better manage our inventory and theyre all in one place

2977385 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system

2977482 so what we should do is get you a job here and buy you a bicycle so you can cycle to work

2977485 theyre educating the people about what will save them from the punishment in the next life
2977486 what about the environment what do they do about that
2977487 well they dont drive gas guzzler suvs like you do
2977488 name me a republican who has won the presidency without winning ohio
2977489 the obama campaign can be looking at a number of states the republicans won in 2004 and say we have a chance of winning those
2977490 ohio would be one of those states but obviously he can look at virginia iowa new mexico nevada and maybe colorado
2977491 mccain does not seem to be expanding the electorate i dont see obama losing anything kerry won and i see him being competitive in states which kerry lost
2977492 mccain will probably carry all or nearly all of the southern states
2977493 virginia is the best shot for obama but mccain would still be the favorite there
2977494 i dont see how a republican wins pennsylvania this year
2977495 what theyre really showing is that hes a schoolyard bully and obama is not punching him back
2977496 mccain can certainly help himself in this state by picking romney
2977497 michigan has been one those states that teased a lot of republican candidates and then fallen by the wayside at the end
2977498 you need a state like virginia to offset those other states
2977499 michigan and pennsylvania even though they have gone for the democrats theyre never easy
2977500 when judah saw her tamar his daughter in law he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face

2977511 regardless of the downturn in the u s and europe there is a strong domestic need particularly in india and china that continues to fuel demand for housing and retail
2977512 theres no question that its going to be a bumpy road if the united states plunges into a severe recession but whereas before there was very little domestic demand in china and india a lot of that demand can now be picked up internally
2977513 pension funds in the west until recently had virtually zero exposure to asia excluding perhaps japan in part because there were so few vehicles in which to invest
2977514 asia has been a challenge but its been building up over time and i think the next 10 years will be the decade of investing in asia
2977515 we are now getting increasingly convinced after the dramatic fall in oil prices that the bad phase is over and people are coming back to the fundamentals
2977516 only a sharp decline in oil and commodities can help the market sustain this rally its going to be difficult otherwise
2977517 if crude and commodity prices come down sharply we could see markets heading northwards as investors start focusing on long term businesses merits of indian companies
2977518 any change in macro fundamentals could see flows reversing back to india

2977553 playing against italy was a tough draw but we shot well together
2977554 at one point we had a four point lead and kept shooting strong which made italy have to really step up their game
2977555 its a bad economy to begin with so with this is a like a jolt in the side
2977556 we cant serve water so we have to serve bottles water and we have to charge them

2977566 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2977567 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2977568 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation

2977659 i spent many many saturday afternoons watching reruns of star trek and dreaming of its worlds leonard nimoy helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold
2977660 id like to think that very same imagination is what fuels my desire and drive as a game designer pushing toward creating an mmo that is the ultimate star trek experience
2977661 we had expected this to happen ive already said this before dont make it an open forum do it behind closed doors there will surely be some form of extreme reaction that will occur
2977662 weve expected the incident to happen because the issue that was to be discussed is sensitive
2977663 i hope we can consider and move on a decision at that time

2977677 the prime minister of new zealand angrily denounced israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a new zealand passport the plot which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years provoked a furious reaction yesterday
2977678 in 2004 new zealand authorities became aware of a covert operation mounted by israels external intelligence agency mossad to secure nz passports which are keenly sought after by those who seek hassle free entry to most countries
2977679 the spy ring consisted of at least three mossad agents working from australia it later emerged that australia secretly expelled an israeli diplomat as a result of this scandal in nz and one new zealand jew
2977680 they duly pleaded guilty to a single charge and served three months of a six month sentence before being deported back to israel they were also each ordered to make a 50 000 payment to the cerebral palsy association as they had sought the passport in the name of an nz cerebral palsy sufferer

2977683 cabaran bagi saya di sini adalah sering kali ketandusan isu yang membabitkan artis negara ini memandangkan saya yang berasal dari indonesia banyak perkara yang harus saya ketahui termasuklah suasana kerja dan personaliti artis itu sendiri
2977684 jika di indonesia kita dilambakkan dengan isu dan gosip artis sehingga tidak menang tangan untuk dibuatnya namun setelah beberapa tahun saya bekerja di sini saya harus cepat mengenali persekitaran kerja dan personaliti bagi memudahkan untuk saya bekerja
2977685 apa yang penting bagi saya adalah isu yang cuba dikupas itu haruslah sesuatu yang lain dari yang lain jika orang lain tidak dapat saya sendiri akan cuba untuk mendapatkan sehingga berjaya
2977686 jika sebelum ini galaksi memaparkan pelbagai isu yang berlaku dan setiap isu itu hanya dapat dikupas terlalu singkat dan ada kalanya tergantung memandangkan waktu siaran hanyalah 30 minit saja
2977687 kali ini kita cuba untuk mengupas sekali gus mencari jalan penyelesaian bagi setiap isu yang membabitkan artis
2977688 kita bukan saja mengupas isu yang negatif membabitkan artis malah realiti kehidupan seseorang artis itu seperti allahyarham loloq allahyarhamah yusni jaafar sazali yusof chong dan banyak lagi
2977689 mungkin ini adalah kekuatan kami dalam produksi galaksi memandangkan hanya empat petugas saja yang mencari bahan isu
2977690 jika di studio kita juga mempunyai petugas iaitu hos baru kami sharifah shahira pembantu produksi nurhaizad azhar penulis skrip nurul syazwani ramlee dan pengarah studio leo rauf makmur
2977691 namun segala isu itu bukanlah hanya di tangan saya sendiri malah kita juga mendapatkan dari medium hiburan tempatan saya juga jadikan internet sebagai bahan untuk mencari idea sesuatu isu
2977692 saya mensasarkan 2009 adalah tahun yang akan melonjakkan lagi program ini dengan mengupas pelbagai isu artis tempatan yang lebih bermoral dan menyumbangkan sesuatu kepada masyarakat
2977693 kita juga berharap segala isu yang tidak diperoleh oleh mana mana media akan cuba diperoleh oleh team kami

2977706 the first gold medal at the olympic games is really a magnet for worldwide media and worldwide viewers so its inevitably got more pressure for athletes competing in the event
2977707 anyway i dont think du lis result is something surprising you can not count on her winning all the time for only one to two contenders allowed through the olympic qualifier its really hard to win often in the big arena like the olympics for one person
2977708 its quite possible for her to win and its also not out of our expectation for her to lose you compete just in top form sometimes and your opponents compete in that form another time du got an impressive preliminaries with a point of 399 equaling the olympic record so generally speaking i still take the result as normal
2977709 du just got much more pressure as far as i judge you media just swarmed around her even in her training i can not bear that if im in that situation so i can feel what du feel
2977710 du is a girl not giving in to frustrations so she would recover from depression soon we got preparations over difficult time and i think she can be competitive in her next event
2977711 though its only a secondary discipline for her she got good performance in last years good luck beijing olympic test

2977745 it must come from our marine coach its really just the mentality we have in the program the older guys have developed it over the years that we just have a no excuses policy it just kind of rubs off on everybody to get back quickly as possible
2977746 hes the best of the best he must drink some certain water back there because hes pretty good
2977747 hes been able to step right into our no huddle offense and been able to run it and execute it and not be out there with his head spinning which happens to a lot of freshmen especially at the quarterback position

2977814 theres no need for that i can easily get the bus back
2977815 yes mum im allowed to drink an occasional cup of coffee
2977816 good shall we say the bluebird at eleven ill treat you to a cake as youre eating for two now
2977817 not more tests i hope im pregnant not ill ive had two children already without any problems and theres no family history of such trouble and no hereditary diseases why do i need more
2977818 neither has this clinic yet you can see you have smoke alarms
2977819 of course if there was a fire wed need to know about it quickly so we could get out safely and possibly even put it out before there was much damage
2977820 exactly the screening tests help to detect potential problems in the early stages before they cause significant difficulties and where treatment can be offered you dont have to have any of them done if you really dont want to but part of my job is to offer the tests and explain them to you the potential benefits of the screening should outweigh the inconvenience and any possible risks from the tests
2977821 yeah sorry i know youre doing all this to help me and the baby and i do trust you its just that i feel having a baby should be getting less complicated not more
2977822 some of the screening procedure is quite simple for example i can learn a great deal about your needs just from talking to you ive already asked about your general health family history social history and your previous pregnancies which you have had that allows me to assess if youre likely to need special attention during the pregnancy and may help prevent problems later in the pregnancy for example if you had diabetes or suffered pre eclampsia in a previous pregnancy you would need closer monitoring than usual if you have social or family problems such as domestic violence then you might need special help
2977823 right i hadnt thought of that none of it applies to me but you wouldnt know that unless you asked
2977824 remember i measured your weight and height the first time you saw me this was because if youre significantly underweight or overweight that may increase the risk of developing problems during pregnancy youre fine so i wont weigh you again unless i have reason to be concerned other tests will be done regularly such as measuring you from the top of the growing uterus to the pubic bone at the bottom of your abdomen
2977825 thats how you tell the baby is growing properly isnt it i can see youd need to check that
2977826 i also want to keep an eye on things like your blood pressure shall we do that now
2977827 yes but if its high dont panic itll just be because my mother in law drove me in
2977828 no its just that she fusses about my delicate condition she had her one child very late in life and i guess she had a rough time
2977829 yes we understand about pre eclampsia now thats one of the reasons for monitoring your blood pressure which is fine by the way your urine samples are checked for traces of protein which is another sign of pre eclampsia i also check for bacteria in case you have an infection thats not producing any symptoms
2977830 and if you thought i was at risk then you could offer help or treatment
2977831 you might remember that at around thirty six weeks i check the babys position
2977832 right if that was the case youd know what to expect at the birth or we could consider trying to turn him
2977833 there are some examinations that would have been done during your mother in laws pregnancy that arent done now routine vaginal and breast are no longer considered necessary if you have no symptoms that need investigation
2977834 so basically youre just keeping an eye on me to check everything is ok
2977835 thats it some tests i can do myself but others are more technical for example the blood tests i took have to be sent to a lab for checking i have the results now youre actually slightly anaemic so ive asked the doctor to prescribe you some iron tablets its nothing too serious though
2977836 but without the test we wouldnt have known and it wouldnt have been until the problem had become more serious that youd known about it yes i can see how some of the tests are helpful
2977837 there are other things we check your blood for one is whether youre immune from rubella another is to check for anti bodies if you were rhesus d negative and your baby rhesus positive then you could form anti d antibodies theyre not dangerous in the first pregnancy but can cause problems in future pregnancy injections later in the pregnancy could be offered in that case blood samples are also screened for infections such as hiv hepatitis b and syphilis
2977838 i didnt realize there were so many things that could cause trouble if not detected but that you can offer help with if you know about
2977839 i wouldnt normally go into details of every possible problem as i wouldnt want to worry the mother i just explain the tests as simply as possible so that the mother can decide if she wants them or if as in your case shed like more information obviously if the tests revealed anything that required treatment id give the mother much more detailed information
2977840 ok that makes sense so are you testing me for anything today
2977841 well do the ultrasound again the first one was to check how many babies you were expecting and to determine the expected date of birth this second one is to check for any physical abnormalities and to see if theres a risk of placenta previa thats where the placenta covers the opening from the uterus to the cervix and it can cause serious difficulties during childbirth
2977842 no either is fine and i want that surprise to look forward to when im going through labour
2977843 i dont want to know if hes got downs syndrome either theres no way id have a termination
2977844 its up to you if you have he test but having the option to terminate the pregnancy isnt the only reason to be tested
2977845 no but you can be prepared one of my mothers learnt she was having a downs baby by the time she gave birth shed told her friends and family so no one was surprised by his appearance she read a great deal about the condition and she joined a support group and met downs children all of which she found reassuring
2977846 hmm i do know something about the condition as i have a cousin with downs it wouldnt be such a shock to me if my baby had it im not sure id find the test reassuring anyway the one my aunt had was negative
2977847 the test is fairly reliable but it is possible to have either a false negative or a false positive if you dont want it done then thats fine no mother has to have any of the screening that she doesnt want
2977848 ok thanks im sorry if i was stroppy earlier i know youre doing your best for me and i do appreciate it honestly
2977849 dont worry about it well blame it on your hormones shall we
2977850 no problem is your mother in law driving you home
2977851 yes but first shes treating me to coffee and cake im going to order the biggest stickiest cake theyve got and let her fuss over me as i eat it then ill tell her about all the tests im having and reassure her that im perfectly fine
2977852 cause an empty room can be so loud and too many tears to drown them out so hold on hold on hold on hold on when you love someone and they break your heart dont give up on love have faith restart just hold on hold on hold on hold on
2977853 just show me your ipod man i wanna see your songs
2977854 if you love someone and they break your heart dont give up on love just hold on
2977855 whats the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking

2977882 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2977883 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2977884 our economy is in shambles and a great deal of that is related to the fact that we have an easily inflatable fiat paper currency that the government can manipulate at will

2977903 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2977904 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2977905 there are disputes about some issues territorial issues and authority issues in south ossetia and separately in abkhazia but there is no excuse for russia bombing targets outside of those areas in and around tbilisi and also mobilising the black sea fleet to go off to the coast of georgia
2977906 russia seems to believe they can have a military victory but in truth there cannot be a military solution to this
2977907 i think the highlight was getting my picture taken with the teams
2977908 its just a very energetic feeling you know they represent the best of u s athletics and they were really excited about their events and theyre full of hope it was just a very uplifting experience

2977918 it is the issue of public safety and endangerment to peoples lives that have led to the onsats appeal to ses to continue the service until a safe and seamless transition can take place ses has refused to do so instead it has imposed arbitrary deadlines
2977919 found problems with overbilling competitive bidding conflicts of interest and compliance with local procurement rules
2977920 on behalf of the navajo attorney general who has received the concurrence of the president of the navajo nation we therefore request that usac and the fcc take no action for a period of sixty 60 days as to any filings made by the nation or its provider related to pending requests for reimbursement
2977921 these agencies can ill afford to be confronted with the precipitous loss of service when dealing with potentially life or death situations
2977922 i therefore urge you to find a manner as expeditiously as possible in which to ensure continued service without interruption
2977923 led ses to delay the shutdown threatened for noon friday
2977924 cannot continue to be caught in the middle we have been extremely patient with onsats situation
2977925 with the expectation that the commission would make certain that all of the affected public safety customers had been notified
2977926 we expect that the commission has notified each of the approximately 25 public safety entities referenced in your letter of this situation and advised each to immediately obtain satellite phones or other substitutes
2977927 its super exciting because well pass just about 50 kilometers 30 miles from the surface and fly into the plume at the south pole
2977928 we wont see such openings even in our highest resolution images
2977929 but maybe just maybe we might see other evidence of eruption either something geologically unusual or banks of snow where icy particles in the jets fall back to the ground
2977930 whatever we see this will definitely be a first and very unusual event
2977931 the temperature and pressure there are entirely congenial to the survival of certain types of microbes
2977932 microbes are known to survive in similar environments on earth
2977933 we point out that venus and earth are very close in terms of proximity
2977934 there are occasions where venus and earth are aligned which would be the best possible time for any exchange of material from venus to earth
2977935 its a much higher altitude where the solar wind is sweeping ions away from the planet
2977936 theres a huge physical disconnect between the clouds and the material thats being swept away by the solar wind
2977937 dust particles are orders of magnitude heavier than these ions and theres not enough energy in the solar wind to be knocking them out of the atmosphere
2977938 im skeptical that you could really get them up to that height but even if you could you would still need a way to eject them thats a whole different ballgame its like saying because ive got a window open and theres air leaking out therefore my bed might somehow fly out the window into my backyard
2977939 while this idea is interesting it doesnt look too good when the numbers are applied
2977940 i concede that the processes are speculative and need to be discussed more carefully but the fact remains that if there is microbial life on venus being lifted to high enough altitudes through convective motion then the transfer is a possibility
2977941 its ok to pursue speculative ideas because we dont want to be too cozy and safe and assume that we know everything about life in the universe
2977942 however we have to be rigorous and careful and honest and logical and scientifically meticulous when we speculate they have not done that when somebody does this and calls it astrobiology it risks discrediting the entire field and associating this necessary speculative edge of astrobiology with complete pseudoscience
2977943 i cant believe if this was peer reviewed that somebody didnt point this out
2977944 i wouldnt call it an artists depiction if it was an artists depiction it was based on data from the satellite
2977945 thats a lot of orbits and that represents a lot of miles and a lot of time
2977946 its been just a fabulous long journey of scientific discoveries with more to come
2977947 something like the hubble deep field which has penetrated far back in time is the kind of thing that wed always hoped to be able to do
2977948 my own program was to discover extrasolar planets at the farthest ranges we can see hst is the only one which can do that
2977949 personally my work in black holes would not have been possible without hst showing that nearly all galaxies contain a massive black hole in their center and that the black hole is an essential component for why galaxies look the way they do
2977950 were still doing good science with it and what appears to threaten its lifetime is not the spacecraft itself but rather our ability to send vehicles up for maintenance
2977951 i would say its biggest legacy would be that wherever it looked with its really broad range of capabilities it found new things many of which people couldnt have even dreamed of
2977952 what is arguably the most important contribution has been the inclusion of the public in the science from hst

2977964 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2977965 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2977966 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this
2977967 this is not about military objectives this is about a political objective removing a thorn in their side
2977968 there will probably be guerrilla warfare all over the country
2977969 we need large supplies of humanitarian aid because we have thousands of wounded and weapons we need weapons
2977970 the whole family is running away there is nowhere for us to take shelter
2977971 my father died today from the bombing ive seen with my own eyes my house was destroyed i buried my father myself by where the house was
2977972 if it happened then its a big mess its a big problem because it is direct confrontation
2977973 this wasnt the way we wanted to start out the olympics
2977974 i wasnt nervous at all it just wasnt our day
2977975 they played great and we played poorly and that combination means we got spanked
2977976 many of us feel very distraught and helpless we really hope the belarus government will only see this as an isolated incident

2977981 those are the rules you have to follow the rules
2977982 the work now is focused on the aircrafts removal and that will be ongoing at this point
2977983 it will be a long time before they can piece everything together and determine the accidents cause
2977984 between the composite sketch and the photo identification i had messed it up
2977985 by the time i got to the physical lineup ron cotton had become my attacker and that was that
2977986 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2977987 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
2977988 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
2977989 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
2977990 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
2977991 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
2977992 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them

2978080 for all the talk about the private sector taking off in iraq it didnt materialize
2978081 people would say well these people are poor we need to help them its true but we didnt create jobs i think this is a huge problem
2978082 i think that the government itself has been concerned about keeping a cap on the number of people that can join the public sector
2978083 when people see a sudden pay raise they will spend
2978084 to be frank we have not been fair to the poorer people or people without jobs or people not on the payroll of the government

2978095 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2978096 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism

2978110 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2978111 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2978112 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2978113 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2978114 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2978115 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2978116 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2978117 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2978118 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2978119 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2978120 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
2978121 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2978122 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2978123 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2978124 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2978125 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2978126 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2978127 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2978128 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2978129 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2978130 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2978131 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2978132 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2978133 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2978134 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2978135 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2978136 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality

2978209 he can make the moment that matters that wins you a game whether it be a through pass a goal a dribble whatever it may be
2978210 he has that talent in him that is something you cannot give a player it is just inside them you have to nurture it and bring it out of him so he can perform at the highest level
2978211 it might be a little earlier for him at the moment it is wrong to compare him with wayne rooney wayne was a man physically when he was 16 he was strong and very advanced
2978212 but with jose we may have to wait a little longer for that strength but if he continues the way he is and maintains the right attitude to learning there is no reason why he cannot be in our first team very soon

2978304 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2978305 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2978306 you told me more about the process than i know
2978307 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2978308 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2978309 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2978310 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2978311 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building

2978322 asked the tharu village fathers to keep their daughters home and send them to school instead of selling them at the annual maghe sakranti festival every january in exchange families could raise the pigs and sell them for the same amount they could fetch for their daughters murrays nonprofit organization the nepalese youth opportunity foundation also would pay for the girls school expenses plus it would kick in a kerosene lamp and 2 liters of kerosene a month coveted items in an area without electricity it was an experiment based on murrays understanding of nepali culture after living there off and on for five years and sponsoring the education of orphans and street children she knew pork is a prized meat and that for some families selling a daughter was the only way to afford food for the rest of the family of the 37 families she and her nepalese counterpart som paneru approached that first year 32 took the deal some asked for and received a goat instead of a pig murray and paneru have since steered 3 000 girls away from slavery and all but eradicated the long held tradition of indentured servitude in the tharu village murray and paneru have been so successful in dang they have started to bring their pigs for girls program to the neighboring district of bardiya since january they have liberated 500 girls there murray said her foundation is putting 1 500 girls through school at an annual cost of 100 per student the nepalese youth opportunity foundation also runs two boarding schools one for boys and one for girls who are abandoned or disabled so far theyve been able to send 30 of their boarding school graduates to college
2978323 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2978324 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2978325 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2978326 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2978327 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2978328 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2978329 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2978330 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2978331 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2978332 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2978333 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2978334 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2978335 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2978336 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2978337 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2978338 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2978339 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2978340 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2978341 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2978342 toks u kandis visai nesisieja su rafinuotu kinu kur siekiu parodyti i rovams
2978343 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2978344 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2978345 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2978346 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2978347 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2978348 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2978349 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2978350 who are open to doing something on the production side
2978351 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2978352 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2978353 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2978354 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2978355 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2978356 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2978357 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2978358 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2978359 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2978360 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2978361 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2978362 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2978363 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2978364 family members believe at this point it is a medical condition that might have led to his death
2978365 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2978366 after laying the groundwork for the memphis soul sound through his work with stax records his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon
2978367 the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present
2978368 our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
2978369 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2978370 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2978371 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2978372 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2978373 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2978374 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2978375 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2978376 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2978377 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2978378 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2978379 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2978380 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2978381 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2978382 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2978383 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2978384 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2978385 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2978386 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2978387 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2978388 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2978389 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2978390 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2978391 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2978392 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2978393 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2978394 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2978395 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2978396 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2978397 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2978398 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2978399 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2978400 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2978401 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2978402 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2978403 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2978404 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2978405 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2978406 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2978407 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2978408 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2978409 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2978419 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2978420 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2978629 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2978630 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2978631 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2978632 of the nature and extent of the loss at the time the theft was reported to the garda in 2007
2978633 i view the loss of information and time very seriously
2978634 i am extremely concerned that this theft of information could cause anxiety to our customers particularly our pensioners i am also very concerned that this volume of information was put on a laptop
2978635 at the end of last year the total number of companies in our enterprise cluster stood at 93 and since then i am pleased to announce that we have reached the 100 mark
2978636 the rapid growth experienced by the hub is reflective of the phenomenal growth in digital media internationally despite the current economic downturn the digital media sector is in a very healthy state and looks set to enjoy sustained growth over the coming years
2978637 it is quite clear that the board is under resourced and works under considerable pressures itself however this situation means that the work of important publicly funded projects can be hugely held up
2978638 means if james is an idiot for that would be ad hominem she did no such thing that someone has in the past bad choices is not in strong position on it have consistently made good choices anyway thats not an ad hominem attack for your argument could be reduced to syllogism
2978639 our whole lifestyle because the bank risks are alienating new customers that america has more financial troubles with it has a level at its is driving bacs of tactics guaranteed to backfire
2978640 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2978641 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2978642 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2978643 n o h viola o igualdade pois o site gratuito
2978644 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2978645 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2978646 i am absoluately prepared to take whatever action is necessary and achievable to secure tasmania s electricity supply into the future
2978647 marketers continue to be frustrated by a lack of functionality that gives them assurance that e mails are being properly delivered
2978648 too often marketers are faced with failed isp connections or endless loops that require intervention from their it organization
2978649 ensuring that e mail messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for e mail marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered
2978650 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2978651 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2978652 damms school in ripon wis has spent 26 000 on its free bike program which so far has signed up half of the 300 student freshman class damm said
2978653 i think a big draw is just the environmental aspect
2978654 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2978655 we have a form that police officers are supposed to fill out every time there is a crash

2978771 negligent tackle and the judges task was to decide on the level of compensation that collett should receive from middlesbroughs insurers
2978772 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
2978773 i dont see anything ground breaking in this if i had been involved in a car crash and suffered brain damage and could not fulfil my career i would be entitled to claim so i dont see why this case should be any different
2978774 by all accounts ben collett was already a very good player and had great potential sir alex ferguson said so and so did many others
2978775 if he had hung around in the game he would have earned significant sums of money but we are not always in charge of our own destinies
2978776 i have seen a lot of people have a career or half a career in football and not be able to cope when it comes to an end
2978777 but ben is a very bright young man whos going to university and hopefully will have a very good career and life

2978781 while there were those involved in the protest who were sensible and responsible there were also those clearly intent on breaking into the power station to shut it down
2978782 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
2978783 the decision to deploy specialist units including dogs and horses is always considered carefully because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest
2978784 there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop

2978821 oddly i think i actually enjoyed last years disaster more even though the sound and bar situations were much improved this time around again girls pissing everywhere does not make for an enjoyable experience the intimate vibe of last year has gone out of the window
2978822 i had heard about the previous year but still naively believed that it couldnt be that bad oh but it was worse than i could ever imagine 2 hours there and 50 of it spent in the toilet queues 2 snakes of desparate folk which very nearly joined end to end please dont bother organising another one eat your own ears yes please do

2978825 many of the impoverished women only ask for money because they have no other alternative
2978826 before the event started i told the organizers we need to find time to educate the women of ramadi
2978827 that will only fix their problems for a month or two instead we have to teach them how to make their own money with more educated and trained women the standard of living in ramadi will continue to increase
2978828 i want them to be more willing to help themselves
2978829 the widows and the divorced women need to find a way to earn a living and rise above their current situation
2978830 theres no way we wouldve been able to hold this event a couple of years ago
2978831 we couldnt even go into the streets without being threatened by the terrorists i would just lock my doors and stay inside my house the entire day
2978832 the iraqi police took the lead and conducted personnel searches and secured the adjacent building which allowed the marines to serve as an overwatch
2978833 i expect this conference to be the beginning of many additional changes in the future

2978835 i suspect that the drop in anti social behaviour has more to do with retailers making a real effort to enforce a minimum purchase age for alcohol rather than a temporary increase from 18 to 21
2978836 liberal democrats believe that the snp has got it badly wrong with its proposal to raise the off sales purchase age to 21 just yesterday strathclyde police revealed that over a fifth of retailers were ignoring the law and selling alcohol to minors
2978837 ministers should be focusing on ensuring that the current minimum purchase age is enforced rather than pursuing a policy that demonises all 18 to 20 year olds as irresponsible drinkers
2978838 id like to congratulate ian robertson for running a strong local campaign
2978839 ian has focused on real issues that matter to the people of glasgow east i am confident that liberal democrats will continue campaigns like the fight against the planned closure of parkhead fire station long after the media circus has left town
2978840 the people of glasgow east have delivered a crushing vote of no confidence in the prime minister and his labour government in westminster

2978844 the u s is looking to streamline the command and control by making mckiernan essentially in charge of all u s forces in afghanistan so that one person can deploy them in support of the overall mission
2978845 i felt i wasnt safe and that meant that my family wasnt safe
2978846 when i arrived here i went to the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr and talked to them about my case but i had no proof that i had worked with the u s army
2978847 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
2978848 we dont have any statistics but we consider there are between 400 000 and 450 000 refugees from iraq here
2978849 jordans population of five million has grown by 750 000 with the arrival of the iraqi refugees
2978850 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives
2978851 at this time most iraqis in jordan dont see a situation where they can return and some will never ever be able to go back
2978852 i put the name of the american commanding officer i worked with at al waleed in google and i couldnt believe it when i found him and saw his picture
2978853 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
2978854 we feel its our nations responsibility to help ivraa is a way to correct some mistakes
2978855 i feel a bit responsible as a former military officer for some of the displacement of iraqis
2978856 based on the documents presented to them they believe salah qualifies for the special immigration visa because its been shown he served as an interpreter for coalition forces
2978857 now in the streets of jordan i walk like this
2978858 but sometimes im still afraid i will be sent back to iraq i always think about this always
2978859 i have filled out my registration form and ballot request
2978860 we work really hard to make sure that the military who want to are able to vote
2978861 we gave out maybe 16 000 ballot applications since july a year ago
2978862 keeps the company down to the last private informed on how to register and vote
2978863 i didnt vote because the only way we could vote was by absentee ballot and we had to fill out all these forms
2978864 with technology computers and the unit voting officer it is very easy to register to vote
2978865 if you have internet access there really is no excuse not to vote
2978866 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2978867 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2978868 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2978869 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2978870 you told me more about the process than i know
2978871 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2978872 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2978873 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2978874 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2978875 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2978876 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2978877 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2978878 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2978879 curiosity got the better of me so i put your name in and you came up
2978880 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2978881 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2978882 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2978883 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore

2978913 if there is a great deal of uncertainty in the market and in policies in the market that investment capacity will be deployed elsewhere
2978914 its just ludicrous that the congress is letting this opportunity slip away
2978915 the increase was driven by a massive 2 5 billion inflow of funds in the form of private equity expansion capital and also by a strong showing from private equity buy outs the message was that investors are keen to put to work the money they raised last year while other investors are looking for exits

2978917 gt adams basin inn owner david haines wants to move a cobblestone house that is more than 100 years old on ridge road to their property and turn it into an erie canal museum
2978918 if they can do it it would be wonderful it certainly wouldnt be very easy to do
2978919 and of course what we need is funding to do that but it would be an incredible publicity coup for the canal

2978949 this is not about the incident in the corridor yesterday although we will be discussing that later i have called you here today to tell you that you have been allowed to take the toads
2978950 the toads are the tests of acute difficulty they are seldom offered and in fact you are only the second student at hogwarts presented with the opportunity in over forty years now this year while the other fifth years are taking their owls you will be able to sit for the toads with them should you pass you will have the choice of staying with your peers and return as a sixth year or you may bypass that and return as a seventh year
2978951 i realize this is a lot for you to take in and you certainly do not have to decide immediately your parents have also been informed you should discuss it with them
2978952 i will leave that to your discretion as i said this is only on the condition that you pass them completely if you do not your scores will be translated into owls and you will complete your studies as normal
2978953 so if i pass them i still have a choice between going ahead and staying where i am
2978954 that is correct over the next two terms immediately after these christmas holidays you will receive private tutorials for each subject to get you up to sixth year level at any time if we feel that you are falling behind with your current or future schoolwork you will be removed from the program do you have any questions
2978955 you said that i was the second in forty years right
2978956 i cannot really divulge that information although she is in gryffindor im surprised she hasnt mentioned it

2979018 getting engaged can be very liberating because all the insecurities about your relationship go because youve made a commitment
2979019 once youve made that commitment in anything then really magical things can happen
2979020 im inspired by women in music who manage to juggle family and a career
2979021 its hard ive got very good friends and family and my mom is amazing anything im forgetting shes on it shes a rock for me
2979022 meine frau und ich werden in england bleiben wo die demokratie eine gr ere rolle spielt
2979023 he is a top class player with a bright future ahead of him and i am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at manchester city
2979024 maryland and the death penalty two county residents will help decide the fate of capital punishment in the state
2979025 i was very angry at first too that is a natural process
2979026 you have to work through that in order to have the strength to go on and do good things
2979027 hes going to pay the price the rest of his life and we dont want him to ever be out and hurt another family but now we can go on with our lives
2979028 i felt good i was on a little slide for a while but it was good to come out and get some knocks especially with guys on base hitting third isnt very different from hitting fourth i guess you know youre going to get up in the first inning so you have to be ready to get in there but i havent been going about things differently hitting in lous spot those are some big shoes to fill but there isnt too much different it doesnt really bother me at all
2979029 i havent really been following the situation in baltimore it is what it is if they feel like giving me a shot im ready to do that but for now im just going to stay down here and keep getting better every day im just going to go out early take my swings take my ground balls and keep improving
2979030 getting early outs is most important i got into a little trouble when guys were hitting me early in the innings but thats what ive been trying to do thats what gives us a chance to win so im glad to give us a chance i got into some trouble when i got the ball up as a sinker ball guy when the ball gets up people start hitting you even on the grounders down the line those were balls up when i keep the ball down people arent getting hits off me if they do get hits when im around the knees i just have to tip my cap
2979031 we have cleared two of the three tracks and are clearing the long distance trains which were delayed after the blockage of tracks

2979041 isnt there another show premiering on fox later in the season
2979042 everybody knows him and he doesnt lose his qualities but he will have to play and i think he will be better with the games and i think he will reach some heights at the end of the tournament
2979043 thats why he has played all the time the coach has the ability to make a change in the team but with ronaldinho he doesnt do it
2979044 and its important for the tournament that ronaldinho is playing all the time
2979045 he probably looked a wee bit out of condition against belgium in the first game
2979046 but belgium played quite a solid game particularly against him so he didnt have the space and time that he might have had against us

2979057 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
2979058 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
2979059 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed
2979060 pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
2979061 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis
2979062 but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts
2979063 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by enemies stop it it cannot just be unity in vain a hollow unity
2979064 it must be unity guided by basic principles principles that will solidify us strengthen us

2979070 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2979071 obvious judicial interference and double standards caused me and my family to receive no justice what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2979072 the panel judge has found that the two defendants are not returning to thailand or presenting themselves to the court by the deadline which violates their bail conditions
2979073 the court has decided to confiscate their bail money and issue arrest warrants for the two defendants
2979074 i expected everything would be better that i might have a chance to prove my innocence and receive a fair trial when i returned to thailand
2979075 if i have a chance i will come back to die on thai ground
2979076 he has insurmountable legal entanglements now he is politically finished

2979078 i got roughed up before but that was something youd expect
2979079 im back to school tomorrow ive got to start studying for my end of term tests
2979080 everybody knows him and he doesnt lose his qualities but he will have to play and i think he will be better with the games and i think he will reach some heights at the end of the tournament
2979081 thats why he has played all the time the coach has the ability to make a change in the team but with ronaldinho he doesnt do it
2979082 and its important for the tournament that ronaldinho is playing all the time
2979083 he probably looked a wee bit out of condition against belgium in the first game

2979085 the student accommodation situation has been worsened by the current credit crunch not only are costs going up but availability has been reduced as many former student landlords are now renting to young professionals who can no longer afford to get on the property ladder
2979086 rent will not go down as long as we have the credit crunch when house prices fall rental goes up
2979087 but there are differences between areas which may affect students choice of university

2979092 be careful what you wish for cuz you just might get it just might get it en espa ol
2979093 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well
2979094 the question is whether our fellow citizens will do more than just pour concrete
2979095 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2979096 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2979097 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2979098 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2979099 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2979100 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2979101 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2979102 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2979103 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2979104 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2979105 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
2979106 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2979107 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2979108 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2979109 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2979110 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2979111 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2979112 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2979113 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2979114 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2979115 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2979116 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2979117 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2979118 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2979119 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2979120 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2979121 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2979122 over a period of time neighborhoods change and improve and we have a real commitment to diversity in our organization
2979123 i think tenants are cautious just about the emerging markets in general
2979124 there is a lack of space and those downtown sites are fabulously expensive
2979125 there was an inevitability that development would move toward noma
2979126 the commercial real estate game doesnt work without debt and it is very hard to come by these days on attractive terms
2979127 there is a notable decline in tenant demand but you still have rents at their peak rates
2979128 if things dont change in the economy or things get worse rents will have to go down
2979129 the temperature variation between day and night at an individual gas station is apt to be negligible
2979130 if fuel is warm when its delivered to a station itll still be warm when its sold a few hours later
2979131 im not afraid of storms for im learning to sail my ship
2979132 what do you reckon to luke and bexs relationship outside do you think its gonna work

2979135 yeah ive got no friends because im so busy im certainly not going to stop being busy for you lot

2979138 my dad believed in honesty extreme honesty extreme ethics really he used to tell me that it was worse to lie about doing something bad than it was to actually do something bad even like murdering someone that really sunk in i never lie even to this day

2979143 so one day when a man did that i just said
2979144 i just cant remember my mom saying she cant do something
2979145 i just think that there are more women now that dont say
2979146 that doesnt happen very often but once in a while well tell them the answer how to fix it
2979147 and i have to go get a man sometimes to tell him
2979148 if you dont come with a part number they dont brush you off they have more patience with you probably more than a man would

2979156 to get a feeling for what hes been doing for the past 20 years its given me a better appreciation of that
2979157 we get up in the morning together drive together we get a chance to talk more usually when driving back in the afternoon im a bit tired in the morning
2979158 theyre familiar with us theyve already been trained if they still want to maintain some income to help themselves out its a win win situation
2979159 but dont take my picture please im on the clock
2979160 a lot of people run in after they get off work
2979161 we try to talk them into downsizing the party in the back
2979162 we have customers whove had work done it does really grow but at first it looks almost like little rows of corn
2979163 none of us is as smart as all of us
2979164 when i joined tec i did not have a strategic direction for my business my objectives were growing the business whilst avoiding going bust tec helped me think about strategy and exit i sold the business in 2006 and it was guidance from my tec group and chairman that helped me appreciate what i needed to do to make my business attractive and valuable
2979165 its given me more of a feel for the business side of the practice
2979166 i now have a much better insight into how businesses operate and are led and therefore its moving towards making me more effective as a potential leader for this business
2979167 in one group alone there have been nine members selling their businesses for more than 3m they would tell you that this had a lot to do with the support and help of the group
2979168 at the time i was working for our major competitor tec vistage and felt that there was a need to focus more on the softer skills of leadership and this didnt appear to be a belief cherished by the american operators of tec therefore i left to set up the academy today you will find the processes very similar to those within vistage but the philosophy is very different
2979169 the board you could never afford and the agenda you could never have
2979170 i find with ace there is a feeling of continuity and sharing as equals more like a family
2979171 i think this is due to the emphasis placed on personal as well as professional development they are seen as inseparable
2979172 this seems to make differences in status or income level between members largely irrelevant
2979173 to see a fellow member rapidly make a huge and difficult shift in his personal life as a direct result of robust feedback from the group is priceless i doubt he could have made such a transformation elsewhere
2979174 i love working with these groups the members are generally highly motivated and totally trusting of their fellow group members this means that objective and meaningful discussion takes place real actions agreed and most importantly each is held to account by the others
2979175 business between members introduces a reason not to be totally open and frank in the issue sessions there are some things that you might not wish to share with a customer or supplier
2979176 such activities can weaken the group and cause a rift if things dont go right we have heard stories about groups in other organisations breaking up because of commercial disputes between members although i dont know if they are true
2979177 given the relentlessness of the pressures on ceos they might not have thought of all the relevant aspects of an issue
2979178 equally ceos usually have no one to whom they are truly accountable often their chairmen neds and functional heads do not challenge at all let alone constructively and their marriage partners do not inhabit the same planets in terms of being able to understand their business needs
2979179 ceos recognise that they are isolated because often they are not fully informed and they feel that they dare not expose their doubts and vulnerabilities even to their key lieutenants in a group environment they can discuss proposed changes within a trusted group of colleagues where absolute confidentiality rules it is cheaper to make mistakes in a presentation to such colleagues who offer and receive peer advice from experience and with goodwill than it is to proceed with a project that later has to be aborted
2979180 i wanted to focus more upon the future but i was too entrenched in the day to day running of impulse i felt overworked and isolated when you are in such a position you cant share doubts with your staff because they look to you to lead
2979181 mentoring makes you accountable to somebody which pushes you harder to achieve what youve set out to do i have quarterly targets i set with my one to one mentor which i have to report back on in the group mentoring sessions my peers act as my non executive directors
2979182 from far beyond the galaxies ive journeyed to this place
2979183 my language has been murdered my shopping trolley murdered my groceries just gone
2979184 but i like dancing and i like the disco cause i left my heart in san fran ciso yeah

2979211 we certainly didnt need a new striker today it was a very good first competitive game for us going forward the combination with my north european colleague daniel jensen worked particularly well and playing together with hugo and bouba is a lot of fun
2979212 we will need to play more quickly in the bundesliga but we will work on that over the next few days if we play in bielefeld next week the way we did in the first 20 minutes here then we will be successful

2979235 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2979236 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2979237 peace must be reinstated and the civilians must be protected this is the most important and from this point of view the president saakashvili accepted almost all proposals we made
2979238 you are talking about the americans they naturally are part of the conflict in some way and this is why we must underline the presence and the strength of the eu i dont believe that the americans would become more actively engaged they of course must be included in the peace process the process must be put into action and it is put into action by french president sarkozi who is also the eu chair
2979239 i think i can imagine a life with this guy
2979240 we like the same things hes really great company and he makes me laugh

2979242 as happy in a bar on a friday night as pottering through a gallery on a sunday afternoon
2979243 the first thing he said was that he had recently turned 38 and wondered if he would ever have children

2979246 there are those who would suggest that we would be better served by simply rejecting this agreement that all we have to do is simply go back and get more
2979247 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger

2979323 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2979324 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2979325 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2979326 this ad buy illustrates how we continue to work closely with our clients to create unique executions and customized opportunities to meet their business objectives
2979327 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2979328 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2979330 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2979331 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2979332 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2979345 the modus operandi of the gang is to conspire and pose as driver and passengers of taxis or commercial buses in the process of which the unsuspecting victim are either robbed of their money and valuables or forcefully strangulated in the attack
2979346 following interrogations the four suspects sani mohammed pius oroke chika ani and ela christopher confessed to have robbed one idris musa of ungwan sanusi area of kaduna on july 14 of his belongings and n70 000 the money was found on the gang during search as well as their operational vehicle
2979347 i did not know these people who were arrested with me i used to work with a gang along the nnamdi azikiwe expressway bye pass to rob passengers of their money phones jewelleries and other valuables we have the driver and others who pose as passengers but i use the rope during our operation to make our victims to cooperate with us how i use the rope is to put it around their neck and tighten it thereby allowing our other colleagues to remove whatever valuables from them
2979348 i am involved in the one chance operation to get money since i started the operation i have made n350 000 as my share of the proceeds from the operations i have been involved in 15 operations we operate along the nnamdi azikiwe expressway bye pass with taxicabs i have a wife and daughter at home the charm found on us is for our protection
2979349 everybody has his department and duty during the operation i am the driver of the one chance taxicab i normally call for passengers and put their load in a good place for our members to open and remove valuables
2979350 there are other members of the gang who usually pose as passengers to attract victims and dissuade victims from alighting from the vehicle if they discover our operation i have been involved in the operation for six months during which i operated eight times at other times i do normal taxi commercial taxicab
2979351 as a result of this fatai one of the aggrieved viewers came forward to demand for the refund of his n10 gate fee since the film he came to enjoy was not what the centre was viewing
2979352 having seen that i brought out a n20 note and gave it to fatai i did this to avoid a clash between us fatai collected the n20 and left at first but after some time he came back insisting that we have to allow him to watch the show
2979353 he accosted us that we must allow fatai back to the centre after we explained to him that fatais gate fee was refunded on his fatais request sani insisted that fatai must be readmitted into the centre or the heavens will fall we however stood to our ground that fatai will not be allowed back into the hall sani took offence with our position obviously and vowed to deal with us one after the other
2979354 this made sani to redirect his anger to samaila he came and wrestled samaila off the ground but basiru and mammans quick intervention saved samaila from sanis physical display of guts thereafter the people around decided unanimously that sanis unbecoming behaviour is intolerable as such they beat the hell out of him once again
2979355 at around 4pm of that saturday when sule was taking home shopping for dinner sani came chasing with a long knife the people around alerted sule and he therefore took to his heels while sani ran after him sule was lucky to have escaped sanis wrath he succeeded by running to his house and locked the gate
2979356 sani was lucky because it was only sule the kiosk owner and samaila the deceased who were on ground without any waste of time sani held samaila by his shirts collar and within a twinkle of an eye he stabbed him twice with his long knife on the chest samaila slumped writhing in pool of his own blood and died on the spot
2979357 i had travelled to kaduna when the incident happened but my husband had called me few minutes before his murder it was not more than two minutes after our conversation as if the killer was waiting for us to finish that sani hacked my husband dead

2979360 in less than a second not less than 10 pigs were around dragging for a cut
2979361 the pigs tore the baby into pieces each dragging away only a portion to fill itself it was a pathetic sight
2979362 but it was real anyway and we rushed to join other neighbours but it was too late the pigs disappeared before our sight with a chunk each

2979427 ein e durchschnittliche r arbeitnehmerin bekommt im falle der arbeitslosigkeit finanzielle unterst tzung unterhalb der einkommens armutsgrenze denn es ist ein einkommen von mindestens 2 149 euro brutto monatlich notwendig damit man ber der inflationsbereinigten armutsgrenze bleibt mehr als 60 prozent der arbeitnehmerinnen verdienen weniger
2979428 bereits jetzt sind 12 6 prozent der sterreicherinnen armutsgef hrdet in nieder sterreich sind dies 12 1 prozent oder 189 000 menschen und es kann nicht sein dass menschen die ihr leben lang hart gearbeitet haben beim verlust ihres jobs pl tzlich in der armutsfalle landen hier besteht dringender handlungsbedarf
2979429 ohne gegenma nahmen wird diese zahl aufgrund der hohen inflationsrate noch weiter steigen denn das durchschnittliche arbeitslosengeld liegt mit 722 euro 67 euro unter der armutsgrenze

2979442 klargestellt ist nun auch dass die von di karlheinz klement eingereichte liste weder die fp k rnten repr sentiert noch mit dieser in zusammenhang gebracht werden kann
2979443 dass klement nicht zustellungsbevollm chtigter f r die fp ist und die listenidentit t der nationalratswahl 2006 eindeutig mit der fp k rnten hergestellt wurde klements oranger zerst rungsversuch ist daher gescheitert

2979462 julia was trying to get out of the way of the picture she wasnt being sarcastic

2979470 that will be the start of a nationwide protest we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
2979471 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities

2979478 i think their fans are boring and ugly and they dont look like theyre having a good time
2979479 i didnt think i would want to get married but i am excited about it
2979480 getting engaged can be very liberating because all the insecurities about your relationship go because youve made a commitment once youve made that commitment in anything then really magical things can happen
2979481 im inspired by women in music who manage to juggle family and a career i certainly dont want to stop touring
2979482 she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired

2979489 the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
2979490 isnt it funny to see that in many cases of such pseudo wars the most active parties on both sides are actually those who contribute the least value to society as a whole not just that particuar platform and they are ignorant too

2979493 i blog to get my name out there so people can find me
2979494 thats why i believe that blogging should be used as an ancillary marketing tool not a primary money making tool

2979498 confronted harper personally before the last election saying that conservative organizers tried to force her to pass off 28 000 of national expenses as their own
2979499 he was giving me a heads up that i may be contacted by the media to give a comment on the television advertising fund they had in place and he asked me not to make any comment
2979500 if i was the victim of one of those e mail scams i wouldnt feel more duped than i do now for having been innocently caught up in this matter
2979501 conservative organizers never approached her because she would have immediately seen right through the in and out scheme
2979502 specifically told by conservative officials that the 14 000 that was deposited in his account was simply going

2979516 they chase us on bicycles when we take walks and are rude
2979517 though they do leave information about free stress tests and the way to happiness
2979518 this is typical of their behavior they act like they own the streets
2979519 they were parking vans this afternoon in the red zone in front of our building on franklin
2979520 and my landlady came out and gave them hell so they moved them

2979550 diese erkl rung zielte darauf ab die ffentliche meinung einzulullen wir entspannen uns aber nicht wir milit rs d rfen uns nicht entspannen
2979551 wir sind bereit unsere truppen wegen der verlagerung georgischer einheiten aufzustocken das wird unsere ad quate antwort sein
2979552 es ist eine l ge dass georgien seine nationale souver nit t sch tzt die forderung an den aggressor die truppen abzuziehen ist gerechtfertigt und unsere regierung unterst tzt sie

2979556 die jetzige situation ist nicht mit derjenigen w hrend der yukos krise zu vergleichen im jahr 2004 hat sich die krise um eine einzige firma entwickelt nun aber sind mehrere faktoren zusammengefallen
2979557 zuerst ein streit um die russisch britische lfirma tnk bp danach eine krise um das metallunternehmen mechel und jetzt die bewaffnete eskalation auf dem kaukasus
2979558 rufen wir uns den fall yukos ins ged chtnis die devisenausl nder kehrten einige monate nach der inhaftierung michail chodorkowskis auf den markt zur ck genau dasselbe k nnte auch diesmal passieren
2979559 ein bestimmtes interesse und die zunahme der investitionen aus china nach russland werden zustande kommen da wir nunmehr den chinesischen finanzmarkt mit regulieren werden und informationen austauschen k nnen
2979560 es gibt fundamentale faktoren die den russischen effektenmarkt nicht nur am wachstum sondern auch an der beibehaltung seiner positionen hindert
2979561 saakaschwilis versuch den konflikt als russisch amerikanisch hinzustellen hat keine unterst tzung gefunden
2979562 gewiss ist dieses land f r amerika geopolitisch von bedeutung wie auch f r jeden staat der anspruch auf die welthegemonie erhebt in jedem fall besteht der wert dieses regimes in seiner antirussischen ausrichtung aber die unterst tzung mit der saakaschwili rechnete hat er nicht bekommen und wird er nicht bekommen auch seitens der nato l nder nicht sie verstehen nur schwer wieso sie mit russland in einer frage in konflikt geraten m ssen ber die es verschiedene standpunkte geben kann saakaschwilis selbstst ndigkeit und unlenkbarkeit erwecken allm hlich unruhe
2979563 wenn russische flugzeuge auf die stlichen vororte von tiflis in der n he des betriebs zur produktion von su 25 maschinen bomben abwerfen und sich die amerikanische f hrung nicht mit milit rischer hilfe f r georgien beeilt wird es f r saakaschwili ungem tlich
2979564 wenn es sich als notwendig erweist zwischen georgien und iran zu w hlen werden die usa iran w hlen denn die nuklearen anspr che teherans machen dem wei en haus weit mehr sorgen als die politischen ambitionen von tiflis geopolitik eben und nichts pers nliches
2979565 die einbeziehung von nato truppen in den krieg ist absolut ausgeschlossen
2979566 die europ ischen armeen haben eine panische angst vor verlusten ein krieg gegen russland ist f r sie ein ding der unm glichkeit das bezieht sich auch auf die usa die zudem voll durch irak und afghanistan abgelenkt sind nur die t rkei die im unterschied zu ihren nato verb ndeten keine eigenen verluste f rchtet k nnte theoretisch georgien zu hilfe kommen es steht jedoch nicht fest dass dies dem wunsch von tiflis entsprechen w rde es besteht die m glichkeit dass die hilfe in gewisser weise zu einer okkupation ganz georgiens ausufern k nnte zweitens w rde die t rkei f r eine operation die mit hoher wahrscheinlichkeit zu einer direkten milit rischen konfrontation mit russland f hren w rde einen sehr hohen preis verlangen sie w rde von den usa eine gr ere wirtschaftliche und milit rische hilfe sowie von europa garantien f r einen eu beitritt verlangen es besteht der verdacht dass man weder in washington und erst recht nicht in br ssel georgiens schicksal f r so immens wichtig f r die eigenen interessen h lt um einen solchen preis zu zahlen
2979567 wir m ssen nach der beendigung des krieges verstehen dass wir jetzt an unserer s dlichen grenze nicht einfach ein unfreundschaftliches land sondern einen direkten feind haben mit dem zu verhandeln viel viel komplizierter sein wird

2979579 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2979580 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2979581 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2979582 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2979583 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2979584 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2979585 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2979586 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2979587 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2979588 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2979589 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2979590 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2979591 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2979592 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2979593 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2979594 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2979595 lindsay and sam sat down with friends and ordered dinner when someone who looked like the chef or owner came up to them and asked if they would go to the kitchen they were so nice they went back and put on aprons and chefs hats and everything but when the owner asked them to pose for photos they became furious
2979596 theyve asked him for a million dollars and i hear hes agreed to give at least 500 000

2979624 it is untrue that i or anyone else in germany wanted war in 1939 it was wanted and provoked solely by international statesmen either of jewish origin or working for jewish interests nor had i ever wished that after the appalling first world war there would ever be a second against either england or america

2979633 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2979634 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2979635 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2979636 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient
2979637 they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
2979638 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well
2979639 but we hope that by 2013 all schools should have enough specialist teachers to operate it
2979640 we should mind humiliation less if we were but humbler
2979641 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2979642 our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the three men who tragically lost their lives
2979643 we are also appealing for anyone who may have seen mr venckus mr calipayan or mr potot in the hours prior to the fire to contact grampian police
2979644 its been a long two weeks for me but its over now
2979645 im happy to get an opportunity to get back on the field
2979646 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2979647 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily
2979648 we had a long night negotiating on some little hurdles and i thought i should raise my fist but he mbeki remained cool and said let us continue talking
2979649 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2979650 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2979651 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2979652 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2979653 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2979654 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2979655 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2979656 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2979657 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2979658 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2979659 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2979660 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2979661 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2979662 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2979663 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2979664 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2979665 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2979666 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2979667 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2979668 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2979669 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2979670 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2979671 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2979672 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2979673 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2979674 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2979675 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2979676 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2979677 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2979678 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2979679 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2979680 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2979681 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2979682 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2979683 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2979684 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2979685 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2979686 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2979687 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2979688 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2979689 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2979690 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2979691 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2979692 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2979693 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2979694 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2979695 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2979696 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2979697 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2979698 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2979699 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2979700 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2979701 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2979702 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2979703 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2979704 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2979705 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2979706 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2979707 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2979708 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2979714 spread democracy around the world and wanted everyone to be freeeeeeeee
2979715 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2979716 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2979717 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2979718 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2979721 talking to all our friends in the other bands through the night everyone was blown away by the crowd all day long heard it was 102 degrees out but it felt about 120 but everyone there in the crowd braught it all day long

2979723 well i wont bore your asses with anymore besides my thumb and nub are tired
2979724 so in closing thanx again to all you crazy fuckers that give us a job to do and a big goddamn kudos to you completely insane peeps that tore it up at ozzfest
2979725 from our interactions in the community right now theres not a lot of support for the project so its not like this is some renegade type of effort this is really reflective of what a lot of people are feeling right now and i think a lot of it is justified when you think about the fact that that under the current plans people are losing access to transit
2979726 these concerns are absolutely understandable they happen in every community in which light rail is but at the end of the day light rail represents a huge investment in these communities so our commitment is that these issues as they are identified we will work through them
2979727 i was one of those community members who was saying id like to be able to cross my street
2979728 where i think it broke down was no one said here are your alternatives we can lose street parking which could have serious impacts on small businesses or restore pedestrian crossings which one is more important to you but rather we got the response well you told us to fix this problem so we fixed it what are you complaining about well we needed to be engaged in that solution not just be told what it is
2979729 i think its to the point now where theyre going to build the thing no matter what happens the train has left the station and its steaming down the tracks full speed and youre not going to stop it
2979730 on a case by case basis were working here and there to see what can be done but weve already gone through a lot of hearings i dont think wed ever move forward on any aspect on any project if you had to have 100 percent agreement on something and this may be one of those issues

2979760 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2979761 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2979762 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2979763 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50

2979766 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2979767 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her

2979772 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
2979773 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
2979774 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
2979775 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
2979776 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
2979777 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

2979785 were hoping to bring our network up to 7 2mbps over the summer
2979786 our network currently offers 3 6mbps which in real terms is around 1mbps and were currently investing in our network
2979787 this means we might get 2mbps when we upgrade the appetite for data is huge so we have to have a sufficiently deep network with the right amount of density and backhaul to cater for all customers
2979788 you have to bear in mind that higher speeds mean the network becomes more sensitive for instance with 7 2mbps you have to be within around 200m of a mobile mast to really get the top speeds
2979789 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot
