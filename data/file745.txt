7450005 there is a big problem in the u s with consumers going on the internet buying drugs at ending out with who knows what
7450006 to challenge for the drug industry isnt so much that theyre losing tremendous sales to drugs sold on the internet
7450007 the challenge is they really cant find too many people who have been hurt by them
7450008 the drug industry needs to show that this is dangerous so people wont buy drugs on the net
7450009 especially re imported drugs because the drug companies want sell at higher prices in the u

7450078 vanessa caught my eye straight away she simply outshines all other girls because of her strong personality i dont know if i believe in love at first sight but i do believe in two people having chemistry straight away
7450079 i dont always find myself dating super skinny girls its not all about what you look like its so much more i know it sounds really cheesy but its more about whats on the inside when youre dating a girl
7450080 i dont know what it was with vanessa but we kind of clicked from the very beginning she is not just a lovely girl she is also a sexy and desirable woman
7450081 vanessa is just a wonderful person i can laugh and talk with her and most of all we have loads of fun
7450082 a crowd came to see what all the commotion was and they found shar and kevin sharing some public affection kevin showed up to wish her a happy birthday they shared a very public embrace and kiss before kevin left
7450083 went to the clubs dj booth to publicly wish shar a happy birthday

7450086 the winner will get to perform with the group on stage during a one off concert but the girls hope theyll be able to discover a hidden talent who could join the band as a fully paid up member
7450087 the girls have a huge amount of commitments outside the band it makes sense to look for someone who can stand in if one of them cant make a show
7450088 they came in together and were very touchy feely there was a lot of hand holding
7450089 there is a saltwater infinity pool in the grounds and an open air shower sienna loved that
7450090 the best part of the party is were going to recognize some really cool kids from youth service america who are giving back to their community thats so awesome because i think its really important for kids like us to volunteer
7450091 i definitely want to get something bad on the road
7450092 we talked until midnight we just clicked weve never been apart
7450093 this is going to catch on everyone has to have one of these
7450094 i thought my olympics were over for sure but at that time i almost did not care i was just freaking out because i had no idea what was happening with my body
7450095 the crowds cheered and i remember telling myself ok the worst is over you have three kilometers to go you can do this you can finish you dont have to fail
7450096 i looked to the stadium it was right there i was next to it i saw the olympic flame only i did not know if i was going to make it inside of it
7450097 my body gave up on me but upset as i am right now i think i will with time look back at this experience as perfect too
7450098 i never had to overcome myself like this before the time may not reflect my fitness and ability but it is an official olympic time
7450099 blogging has given me a way to reflect on my experience as i am experiencing it
7450100 it really is wonderful to be able to share this experience with people i care about and who care about me reading their comments or posting something they may find interesting gives me something to look forward to each day i just try to include in my blog a little bit of everything so that everyone can find something interesting to read i am sure a lot of people dont care about my analysis of a particular workout but that is important to me and i know my running friends probably enjoy following that aspect of my experience
7450101 about every few hundred yards if you look hard enough you see people with brooms
7450102 the sidewalks seem completely clean so it just seems a little needless to continue sweeping them and most people who do this seem at quite a different place as they are doing it
7450103 feels kind of like being at a huge conference of something such as teachers of english to speakers of other languages people with badges everywhere only a lot more security
7450104 the focus right now is on getting as much rest as possible
7450105 with marathons the hardest training happens up to three weeks before the race at this time its just fine tuning
7450106 for the managers the pressure is mostly finished when the games start
7450107 the high pressure comes in the year leading up to it
7450108 i am well aware that i will not be winning a medal
7450109 i will be competing against over a hundred of best women from around the world most of whom are professional runners who do not have other jobs let alone work on their doctoral degrees
7450110 thats what the preseason is not about its about the effort guys having the desire to basically make the team everybody
7450111 im not sure really how i performed until we watch the film tomorrow
7450112 obviously we didnt win and thats the most important thing so theres obviously room for improvement and that includes me
7450113 those guys are great athletes and good players and those are the types of plays that they can make i have to trust them and give them an opportunity to make those plays i enjoy playing the game and all these guys do too we work hard and when we do something good we should celebrate it but like i said before one or two good plays werent enough
7450114 but regardless of whos out there its up to us to execute and do our own job it may come out where we may have to be without tom so its up to whoever is in there to execute
7450115 at the end of the day we look back from where we were four weeks ago were getting better as a team obviously as an offense weve been accustomed to one style of play and its high flying and its fast and its kind of a vicious style of offense it gets after you well now weve got to find a different way to win ball games on offense
7450116 its difficult right now just because the people that are in there were not executing
7450117 regardless of whos in there were not executing thats the bottom line for us

7450148 the only reason we took this casino computer programmer volunteers case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted
7450149 the judge has a great law pedigree and this will allow us greater scope when the casino computer programmer volunteers case is argued
7450150 im excited to be litigating this casino computer programmer volunteers case with my colleague kroemer tirona a distinguished attorney with more than 25 years experience

7450169 im really impressed by the planning that went into this online gaming project were going to be offering a wholesome curriculum that will prepare students to meet the demands of the real world while developing their appreciation for learning
7450170 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best online gaming learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
7450171 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a online gaming school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
7450172 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
7450173 which will be open to all students with a b or better overall average well be competing against all other district schools both public and private to expose our scholar athletes to the best competition in the area
7450174 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
7450175 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our online gaming school
7450176 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth
7450177 non residents of the local town will also have the opportunity to attend the online gaming school either in the magnate program or apart of the night school program for adults

7450254 cooperative and pluralistic security order in asia based on mutual understanding trust and sovereign equality

7450261 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7450262 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7450263 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7450264 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7450265 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7450266 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7450267 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news
7450268 as long as congress is sitting and not doing the peoples bidding then were going to be here

7450273 it is critical that we are on the same page acting together quickly so we can complete our business and move on with our lives
7450274 i want to see whats out there with regard to a sale
7450275 not a week goes by that i dont get at least two or three people asking whens it opening
7450276 if we reopen our goal is to reopen elsewhere in boca
7450277 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7450278 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7450279 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7450280 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7450281 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7450282 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7450283 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7450284 we will have a strike line actively going throughout this process
7450285 there are other labor unions who also support us and we will have a visible presence through the strike process
7450286 parta will continue to provide transportation to citizens of portage county whether or not the drivers decide to strike
7450287 china completed its stint as olympic host sunday with a superstar studded closing ceremony that capped a 16 day pageant of state of the art logistics and astounding athletic feats set out for a curious world
7450288 michael phelps with his eight gold medals in swimming and jamaicas effervescent usain bolt with three golds and three world records in the sprints
7450289 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7450290 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7450291 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7450292 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7450293 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7450294 improved transportation infrastructure more grass roots interest in recreational sports a more aggressive approach to curbing air pollution and other environmental problems
7450295 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7450296 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7450297 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7450298 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7450299 we have played four matches this season and are 2 2
7450300 its tough for the girls because they dont play in a league
7450301 our no 1 goal is to learn and have fun and let the wins and losses fall where they fall
7450302 the girls enjoy meeting people from other schools and playing the game
7450303 on the eve of the democratic national convention barack obama said sunday he hoped a week of political speechmaking would persuade reluctant middle class voters to swing behind his bid for the white house while republicans sought to stir discontent among hillary rodham clintons supporters
7450304 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7450305 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7450306 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7450307 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7450308 the son of a white mother from kansas and a black father from kenya who later left the family
7450309 thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7450310 this is our first year and its been very successful
7450311 weve had beautiful weather and the turnout has been wonderful
7450312 weve had good weather all week and the campgrouds have been very busy
7450313 het moet echt nu af ik moet het hebben en trouwens zoveel werk heb je daar toch niet aan t is allemaal bestaand materiaal
7450314 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain last week as part of world water week the stockholm environmental institute the stockholm international water institute the un food and agriculture organization and the international water management institute released a collaborative paper
7450315 but this is unique we dont know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world
7450316 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7450317 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7450318 the site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short term climate change and temperature variations
7450319 so if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7450320 but what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
7450321 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately
7450322 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7450323 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7450324 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future
7450325 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there
7450326 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
7450327 eventually i quit ballet and started tennis i was really good at ballet but i had more passion for tennis
7450328 i tried to kid around with her but no one really wanted to play with me because i was bad
7450329 i started out playing in parks programs that they had for free
7450330 i really like working hard and seeing the hard work pay off
7450331 i like the fact that tennis is one on one so if you do well its a big accomplishment for yourself
7450332 my parents always take me to tournaments no matter how close or far away they are
7450333 in late may 2008 a group of database researchers architects users and pundits met at the claremont resort in berkeley california to discuss the state of the research field and its impacts on practice this was the seventh meeting of this sort in twenty years and was distinguished by a broad consensus that we are at a turning point in the history of the field due both to an explosion of data and usage scenarios and to major shifts in computing hardware and platforms given these forces we are at a time of opportunity for research impact with an unusually large potential for influential results across computing the sciences and society this report details that discussion and highlights the groups consensus view of new focus areas including new database engine architectures declarative programming languages the interplay of structured and unstructured data cloud data services and mobile and virtual worlds
7450334 surprisingly easy for the group to reach consensus on a set of research topics to highlight for investigation in coming years

7450345 we explained to the people that it was not possible to return 400 acres as they are an integral part of the nano project we also told the villagers that there were many who wanted to collect their cheques but could not because of threats from the save farmland committee
7450346 we will ask them why they dont want to give up their land the door to door campaign will begin tomorrow

7450365 i think the next couple of weeks will tell theres certainly some signs i guess thats to be expected you play in the finals series five or six years i think youve got to give some credit to the group that even though we are not playing great footy at the moment to make the finals six years in a row its enormously challenging
7450366 i think youve got to find the balance weve got two weeks this games important on saturday night but more from the point of view of how we set up for the next final we might need to rest some players
7450367 weve got a week to sort ourselves out and get ourselves to a position where we are able to compete against st kilda or adelaide or collingwood thats the immediate challenge
7450368 we know it doesnt mean anything in terms of getting in or out of the finals weve got to take the opportunity to rest some players with an important game the following week we need to take this week to get ready for the first week of the finals
7450369 we have six state of the art race car simulators all of which are actual race cars
7450370 i liked the idea and thought i wouldnt have any competition
7450371 this isnt the watered down stuff you see in arcades or at home
7450372 its really competitive if youre a fan of nascar you should come here
7450373 he just lived his life as full as he could
7450374 the presence and love in his heart and spiritual quality of him and how he cared for people was unbelievable
7450375 hes not the kind of person you would think would normally be appointed to the board of supervisors
7450376 i found him to be a very good supervisor he took his constituent responsibility seriously he made government interesting
7450377 the environmentalists must view the need for shelter of humans as the same need for wildlife to have shelter
7450378 this can be done we are not talking reinventing the universe here we are talking about joining the creative and monetary forces together to work with the political power structure it can be done
7450379 i want to accomplish what i started to bring the south county into its proper perspective in santa cruz
7450380 the south county has never perceived its fair share of health and social services or fair political consideration
7450381 i have no respect for chris matthews and people in watsonville have no respect for him
7450382 i think marilyns conduct is a shame and i think shes out of her mind
7450383 i apologized for making his life so miserable it was kind of a mutual thing
7450384 he should have been more subdued and learned more things before reacting
7450385 what i was looking for was that he was not elected
7450386 after we got out of office i really liked him
7450387 the poet and patriot became a second home not only for me but for an entire generation of santa cruz writers and political activists and irish partisans
7450388 most people know me on a lot of different levels
7450389 they dont even know i can write they cant believe i can spell correctly
7450390 he lived a serious life in a joyous way that i thought was engaging to others
7450391 i sing about everyday stuff keeping it real and little situations or something thats really bothering me
7450392 im influenced by everything i would say rock alternative with a hip hop influence r amp b based riffs
7450393 the hardest part of making the album has been working with someone else and having each song come out how you want it to come out
7450394 i will just be one of millions of people just like me and here im still original and keep it real you have to make your fan base wherever you are if i cant make it here i wouldnt be able to make it in l a either
7450395 they his young players have to work harder to get back into the game so it probably does deflate the young blokes
7450396 you dont necessarily need senior players that have been in the game for so long making off the ball decisions like they do
7450397 i think the way hes been playing in the last few weeks in the role around the midfield and creating for our team has been a positive
7450398 if he thinks he can play on next year then by all means play on you need players at a club to guide the younger guys
7450399 jeffs been around for a while and played in big games grand finals and some of the younger guys look up to him just the way he performs
7450400 the experience that hes had just to guide the young blokes will be very important afl
7450401 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian sate
7450402 esa ha sido nuestra situaci n en otros partidos tambi n
7450403 saakashvili should be tried for the stupidity that he has committed here
7450404 but any trial should only happen after the barbarians have left our country
7450405 id rather be in my home than in a destroyed building
7450406 but im sure the country will be reunited again im 100 percent sure
7450407 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
7450408 it will be a difficult autumn and it will be a difficult winter
7450409 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7450410 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7450411 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7450412 soalnya gini pak waktu pulang sekolah ali lari di samping becak sedangkan biaya becak sekolah sampai ke rumah kan 2000 rupiah jadinya kan ali bisa hemat duit
7450413 my god the paradigm has shifted these guys are dinosaurs theyre living on borrowed time and technology has moved past their ability to do their jobs the way they used to do them
7450414 this is who i am and i cant compartmentalize things the way you can and i see your end in sight and im asking you to come to this precipice and jump off because i have i accept who i am and you havent you still think youre one thing when youre really something else
7450415 what youre really doing is holding up a mirror to yourself and youre just refusing to see it
7450416 i thought bolton were resilient very tough to play against and very focused we were a bit fortunate and in the end we could have won by two or three goals but that would not have been a fair result
7450417 i think we are both better teams than last season
7450418 they have built their side they lost elmander early on so we did not get the chance to see what he is going to be like they are a strong determined side and i think they will do very well this season
7450419 we always looked like we would get a point but to get three points was a bonus
7450420 our goalkeeper shay given was brilliant he has come back from a life threatening injury at west ham
7450421 it was going to take something to get the team going and the crowd going and his penalty save did that
7450422 le mot r sister doit toujours se conjuguer au pr sent
7450423 we dont care what the girls actually think we just want them to write porn for our amusement
7450424 my law has just been violated it dont make sense theres gotta be another particle to make this balance
7450425 there is no higgs we need new physics to account for why things have mass something in our standard model went awry
7450426 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7450427 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7450428 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7450429 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7450430 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7450431 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7450432 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7450433 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7450434 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7450435 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7450436 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track

7450465 this years surge in global food and fuel prices has increased the challenges facing egypts policymakers
7450466 the power of egypts monetary tools to curb inflation is still quite weak raising the prospect of double digit inflation continuing well into next year and no reduction in the very high budget deficit is planned this year with the timing of critical fiscal measures subsidy reductions and the introduction of vat sensitive to their impact on inflation
7450467 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7450468 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence

7450476 i had some pain in the back they massaged it and i thought that it was okay but after the sixth lap it started again i just forced it
7450477 weve already booked a hotel in niamey and also got the teams visas
7450478 that sh130m is what we shall require for the teams accommodation and allowances
7450479 whosoever holds contempt for the ruler of allaah upon the earth then allaah will hold contempt for him
7450480 verily the person who shall suffer the severest punishment is the one who is most severe in punishing the people in this world
7450481 whosoever wishes to advise the ruler concerning a matter then let him not do it openly rather he should take him by the hand and take him into seclusion so if he accepts his advice then he has achieved his objective and if he does not accept from him then he has still conveyed that which was a duty upon him
7450482 the right of every muslim whom allaah has blessed with something of knowledge and understanding fiqh is that he enters upon the ruler to command him with goodness and to prohibit him from evil and to admonish him
7450483 the most excellent jihaad is a truthful word spoken to an oppressive ruler
7450484 the advice to the leaders of the muslims is to aid them upon that by which they will become established and it is to warn them against negligence and to correct their deficiency when they slip and to unite the word upon them and to reject the hearts that have enmity towards them and the greatest advice is to prevent them by using that which is good from oppression
7450485 verily hajjaaj is a punishment of allaah so do not repel it the punishment of allaah with your hands but you must repel it with humility and submission
7450486 maalik ibn deenaar narrated to me that al hajjaaj said
7450487 do you do such and such with the ummah of muhammad salallaahu alaihi wa salam
7450488 for the reason that i am the punishment of allaah upon the people of iraaq when they innovated into their religion whatever they innovated and when they abandoned the commands of their prophet alaihis salaam whatever they abandoned
7450489 as for advice to the imaams of the muslims and they are their leaders from the main leader to the ministers and judges to everyone who is appointed over them with a general or specific type of leadership then it is to believe in their leadership and to listen and to obey them and it entails invoking people to do likewise and to strive according to that which is feasble to guide them and it is to inform them of everything that benefits them and benefits the people and to the establishment of their obligations
7450490 ibn umar made the bayah to abdul maalik marwaan and it was by the sword that he took authority and land maalik informed me that he wrote to him acknowledging his listening and obedience upon the book of allaah and the sunnah of his messenger
7450491 the fuqahaa jurists are in agreement concerning the obligation to give obedience to the sultaan who took over them by force and also to perform jihaad along with him and that obeying him is better than rebelling against him due to what this would contain of the shedding of blood and subduing of the common masses
7450492 that is good for me i will go out there and do my best i want that honour
7450493 im an architect of building teams im building a team at bunamwaya
7450494 moviegoers nowadays not only watch movies but also read about the different technical angles used in the film to give it a more authentic look cinema is also evolving as a means of documenting events rather than just being inspired from literature
7450495 earlier people used to find it difficult to believe that a real life incident can be picturised in the same manner but now with the change in audiences tastes the demand for such movies have increased prompting producers to encash on the trend
7450496 closing a gap wider than 10 metres will be very hard in this race
7450497 i feel were probably one of the teams and i think theyre all about the same really between fourth and twelfth we could have finished anywhere up to fourth matthews said
7450498 were going to finish tenth or eleventh so therefore thats a failure
7450499 weve failed to end up where i think were capable of doing
7450500 we had seven games that have been decided by less than two goals and we lost three and won four matthews said
7450501 theyre the ones you tend to think if youre in front with a few minutes to go thats where you feel like you should be able to now protect the lead for a few minutes
7450502 one of the things that you always do at the end of the season and players should as well is ask how many players had career best years or how many players played as well as they have before
7450503 over the whole season there would be more that would look back and say no i didnt have a great year
7450504 some might say i had a poor year some might say i had an okay year but there would only be a handful that probably have felt yeah this is my best year that ive had in my footy career
7450505 i feel like weve got more upside in our players than weve got logical downsides so i still think were on the up he said
7450506 i just want the moskaly and khokhly derogatory terms for russians and ukrainians respectively to leave us to get on with our lives
7450507 for the 2010 presidential elections this is highly plausible as moscow will most likely be looking to diversify after its spectacular failure to fix the 2004 elections in favour of one candidate yanukovich
7450508 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7450509 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7450510 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted

7450588 all art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator
7450589 a genius must be a visionary which both were picasso was one of the so called modern artists in the early 20th century that borrowed heavily from past african masters few contemporary african artists have the talent and genius to awe their viewers like past african artists who created the masks textiles and sculptures that reside in the worlds museums expedito is an exception
7450590 the bird of peace emerging from the stone of despair
7450591 walking on the beach l found the pebbles quite stunning and i picked a few to bring home with me
7450592 jonathan kingdon was one of my tutors he was a professor in painting drawing and anatomy
7450593 jonathan kingdon is an original a genius he stretches beyond the boundaries of an artist and a scientist like leonardo da vinci michelangelo and einstein before him under his tutelage one can discover the many facets of an artist studying art in makerere back then was exciting many came and didnt know who they were and then discovered their latent talents some thought they were painters but turned out to be sculptors while some found their calling in paint it was like losing your way and finding it through intellectual stimulation an artists brain is complex and therefore it is a long and tricky exercise delving into it
7450594 art school was important because it was training for exposure and making a lot of discoveries about the self you were exposed to the wider school of society and the environment space and functions mingling with architects lawyers doctors and many other different people makerere was then fluid not restrictive like today
7450595 it is not enough to just study art and become a teacher art is more than academia
7450596 we were totally disoriented by slavery and the coming of the arabs and christianity on our continent their systems clashed with ours so we were robbed of the chance to be ourselves or for our civilisations to evolve we surrendered our ways and became artificial practitioners of alien ideas we need to do more in the documentation and exploration of our artists before all is lost
7450597 we as africans have to develop ourselves or we will sink deeper into nothingness
7450598 look at mahatma gandhi he forced the white man to accept him as an indian
7450599 people become secure and comfortable with where they are but once in the comfort zone they become weak and this is when african politicians step in to exploit the people and it becomes impossible for us to move ahead then we lose our ability to discover ourselves
7450600 look at bill gates it is nothing other than an artistic brain working and using the scientific component of his brain
7450601 however it has been labelled primitive and tribal whatever primitive means and therefore made to be of a lesser kind by the colonialists
7450602 which the european renaissance was copying african art is a mosaic of ideas and elements borrowed from nature it is not simplistic the european renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries almost became a science whereas in comparison african art was an adoration of the human form
7450603 artists are becoming more isolated and thats the tragedy artists cannot inspire themselves
7450604 in africa as a whole there are few contemporary artists whose works have the spirit that evokes a sense of awe in the viewer like those old masters who produced the sculptures that moved the early modern masters and thus forever changed the face of world art

7450620 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7450621 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7450622 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7450623 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7450624 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7450625 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7450626 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7450627 the guides are experienced people among the best around there was no negligence involved it is just that the mountain is an extremely dangerous environment even for those who know it well

7450647 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian sate
7450648 i suppose that russia started thinking about the military intervention in georgia sometime in 2007
7450649 in july 2007 russia about pulling out from the conventional forces in europe treaty limiting military forces in europe and in caucasus
7450650 we had only 200 tanks because we had no right to have more according to the treaty russia brushed off its commitments by withdrawing from the treaty
7450651 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible
7450652 because the webmaster sees the site everyday but the customer only sees it once or twice
7450653 i triple check and test all our las vegas nevada politics website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
7450654 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
7450655 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
7450656 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
7450657 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
7450658 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
7450659 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a las vegas nevada politics project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs

7450678 i often joke with foreign interviewers and say that our level of human performance is second in the world
7450679 number one is north korea their performances are totally uniform and uniformity in this way brings beauty we chinese can do it too after hard training and strict discipline chinese achieve that as well
7450680 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks and no one can suffer any discomfort because of human rights
7450681 this caused me no end of worry one week i thought everything had been rehearsed completely without any problems but in fact they could not even stand in straight lines
7450682 you couldnt criticize them either they all belong to organizations some kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard and can put up with a lot of pain
7450683 we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month thats the reason our performers give such brilliant performances i think other than north korea no other country anywhere in the world can achieve this
7450684 you do not have a chance to talk back it is impossible to explain or reply and you cant say this opinion is not a good one so lets not listen to it so what can you do you must be clear headed
7450685 you can ask my team when i came back to transmit these opinions i always said that the leaders were right
7450686 like the moveble type cubes at the opening ceremony the performers follow orders
7450687 the actors listen to the orders and can carry them out like computers
7450688 it is possible an agreement will be reached in the next two weeks
7450689 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces
7450690 it is not easy release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7450691 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7450692 that win and this tournament is more special than any championship that any of us will ever win
7450693 i am so excited i have been waiting for this for four years and now its finally here

7450697 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7450698 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7450699 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities

7450712 zelf verlies ik met het overlijden van mgr schruers een geestelijke vader en een broeder in het bisschopsambt die als geen ander ons bisdom kende en die het bleef opvolgen ook tijdens zijn emeritaat
7450713 voor de limburgse katholieke gemeenschap is het overlijden van mgr paul schruers een groot verlies gedurende 34 jaar waarvan 19 jaar als hulpbisschop van mgr jozef maria heusschen heeft hij als bisschop ons bisdom sterk gestuurd en diepgaand geleid
7450714 in de limburgse samenleving was mgr schruers graag gezien zijn sociale bekommernis was groot als geen ander kon hij luisteren naar verhalen van mensen en wist hij bemoedigend te spreken in alle mogelijke omstandigheden hij wist ook gezagvol stelling te nemen als het moest limburg verliest in hem een icoon van menslievendheid en een geestelijke leider voor velen een houvast zijn vriendschap met bisschoppen van de wereldkerk en met name uit afrika maakte van hem een wereldburger

7450731 now about the money being collected for the christians in jerusalem you should follow the same procedures i gave to the churches in galatia on every lords day each of you should put aside some amount of money in relation to what you have earned and save it for this offering dont wait until i get there and then try to collect it all at once
7450732 put aside some amount of money in relation to what you have earned
7450733 i waited patiently for the lord he inclined and heard my cry he brought me up out of the pit out of the miry clay he set my feet upon a rock and made my footsteps firm many will see many will see and hear
7450734 40 became the closing song at u2 shows and on hundreds of occasions literally hundreds of thousands of people of every size and shape t shirt have shouted back the refrain pinched from psalm 6 how long to sing this song i thought of it as a nagging question pulling at the hem of an invisible deity whose presence we glimpse only when we act in love how long hunger how long hatred how long until creation grows up and the chaos of its precocious adolescence has been discarded i thought it odd that the vocalising of such questions could bring such comfort to me too

7450743 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7450744 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
7450745 china failed to force a vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia failed to end border clashes failed to cast doubt on the strength of the soviet power failed to dispel the image of china as a paper tiger and failed to draw the united states into an anti soviet coalition
7450746 for china the physical territorial losses were enormous an area exceeding that of the united states east of the mississippi river officially became russian territory or in the case of outer mongolia a soviet protectorate
7450747 the end of extraterritoriality in china the case of the soviet union 1917 1960
7450748 t he soviet union under the pretext of assuring the independence of mongolia actually placed the country under its domination
7450749 there is a tangibly strong soviet interest coinciding with vietnamese interests to reduce chinese influence in this part of the world
7450750 the breakdown of vietnams relations with china after 1975 and vietnams current pro soviet alignment may be traced to vietnamese resistance to chinese pressures to take sides
7450751 securing ourselves and our socialist friends against possible aggression whatever the source
7450752 attacked or threatened with attack with a view to eliminating that threat
7450753 thus two strategic alliances had been created in the closing months of 1978 a soviet vietnamese alliance and a sino american alliance and they would prevail for about a decade
7450754 had there been no soviet vietnamese alliance the sixteen day war between china and vietnam might not have been fought
7450755 as a result even ross has concluded that in the wake of vietnams successful occupation of cambodia it was
7450756 asia in a global context strategic issue for the soviet union
7450757 chinese demonstrated that they could attack a soviet ally without retaliation from the paper polar bear
7450758 threaten and attempt to pin down china from the south
7450759 to contain and encircle china in southeast asia thus posing a serious threat to chinas southern flank
7450760 the 1979 sino vietnamese war was chinas most important foreign policy failure since 1949
7450761 the failure of chinese policy underscores the ambiguous role of the regional power in contemporary international politics
7450762 china got burned by limited measures against vietnam in 1979 china was going to teach vietnam a lesson but vietnam taught china a lesson
7450763 soviet military deployments in the asia pacific region implications for chinas security
7450764 chastened by the experience of 1979 now stations 700 000 combat troops in the northern portion of the country
7450765 who are waking up to the reality that this is going to be a real dogfight
7450766 he does have this challenge of making people comfortable with him partly because of the historic nature of his candidacy and partly because of this idea that hes famous but not necessarily well known by the voters
7450767 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7450768 just when they thought it was possible it was taken away
7450769 if we cant win the presidency at a time of war and recession because were not united
7450770 then i dont see us winning the presidency for a long long time
7450771 i do believe that what we instituted three years ago helped us not to crack today
7450772 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being ignorant being individuals
7450773 what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7450774 i told coach k after the game thanks for believing in me
7450775 i think they took this tournament very seriously they were very hungry they gave a better feeling of a team it wasnt so much individual stuff individual talent
7450776 the next time a member of staff logged in her username and password were collected and stored
7450777 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen makes this particularly rare
7450778 the russian gangs who specialize in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7450779 continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7450780 nobody ever gave him a colonoscopy nobody ever asked about it i have been going through it ever since i was told that guys over 45 should look into this in retrospect i look back at what happened to my dad and think if they had given him a check up he would have gone another 10 years
7450781 there was a problem going completely bald no one had taken into account that there has to be an appliance put on the back of my head to look like a cut with staples in it so we couldnt actually shave my head as we had originally thought i have less than a quarter inch of hair which is close to bald
7450782 i myself would be gay if it werent for one thing
7450783 that one thing being women breasts vaginas yeah if i had to give those up to be gay its not worth it however much fun it would be otherwise
7450784 i am so sick of people not giving me my microphone back

7450788 before the sixteenth century 1521 and 1571 there was no philippines no filipino only a group of over seven thousand islands intermittently invaded by negritos proto malays and indonesians and nominally ruled by the madyapahit and the shri vishaya empires and swept by the tide of the chinese mings
7450789 who from motives of their own discouraged the learning of spanish by the natives in order that they may always act as intermediaries between the people and the civil authorities and thus retain their influences over their charges
7450790 when the americans took over the philippines only 2 5 of the filipinos spoke and wrote in spanish
7450791 it is safe to say that the literacy rate of the native population was somewhere between 5 and 8
7450792 there is however another aspect of the case that should be considered i had this forcibly presented to me as i traveled through the islands using the ordinary conveyances and mixing with all sorts and conditions of people although on the basis of school statistics the statement is made that more filipinos now speak english than any other language no one would think of the testimony of ones own ears everywhere spanish is the speech of business and social intercourse for one to receive prompt attention spanish is always more useful than english and outside of manila is almost indispensable americans travelling about the islands use it habitually what is more they discourage the use of english this was a development that took me by surprise i asked an american i met on an inter island steamboat why he always spoke spanish to the stewards and waiters and whether they could not understand him in english he said that probably many of them could but one would not be treated with as much respect using english and not spanish that filipinos seem to loose their manners using english becoming rude familiar and insolent
7450793 there is unmistakable significance in the fact that there is not in all the islands one filipino newspaper published in english all of the many native newspaper are published in spanish and in the dialect
7450794 no es acaso de sentido com n que hubiera sido muy f cil propagar m s el castellano que ya se usaba como lengua oficial y se hablada ya por much simas familias filipinas dentro y fuera de sus hogares y del cual contaba entonces el pa s con muchos literatos poetas y escritores distinguidos
7450795 is it not of plain common sense to know that it would have been far easier to further propagate spanish which was already the official language and the mother tongue of so many pure filipino families in and out of their homes and from whom where born so many writers poets and distinguished men of letters
7450796 indudablemente como dice un ilustre filipno miembro actual prominente de la administraci n de justicia que con el mismo tiempo y dinero gastado sistema y otros medios modernos de instrucci n empleados en la ense a del ingl s si en lugar de ste se hubiera propagado en mucha mayor proporci n que se haya hoy propagado el ingl s

7450808 irrigating with wastewater is a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
7450809 the implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
7450810 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
7450811 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers

7450817 what kind of contribution does this journey make to the promotion of ideas of reconciliation and compromise none
7450818 one cannot place any responsibility on the palestinian authority for these theatrics as the pa has no control of gaza
7450819 there was a period when they thought that everything was win win for them they attacked the crossings and assumed that wed close them and they could blame us for shortages we managed to make it clear through the arab press that gaza had to choose merchandise or qassams and mortars
7450820 the claims of electricity shortages and hunger were part of hamas campaign of lies

7450879 my fathers paradise a sons search for his jewish past in kurdish iraq
7450880 even if a few strands of tzitzit poked out from beneath their shirts
7450881 my father had staked his life on the notion that the past mattered more than anything
7450882 but after moving across the country to attend college falling in love with and marrying a non jewish woman and working hard in his first reporting jobs sabar was drawn to write about his father after the scholar was called to consult on the television series
7450883 about the language jesus might have used for the first time sabar asked his father as he might have questioned any source about his life in zakho his story in the providence journal
7450884 scholar dad goes showbiz i am the walrus in aramaic
7450885 several years later after he and his wife had their first child a son sabar began seriously thinking about
7450886 would his son feel the way i did about my father that this guy had nothing to teach me that i didnt care where he came from that i was my own person it took me back to some long neglected questions
7450887 aware that his potential sources kurdish jews like his father who remembered life in iraq were aging sabar felt a sense of duty to preserve their past
7450888 collecting an impressive amount of detail sabar creates a compelling narrative
7450889 sabar conveys the life of zakho with its storytellers beggars traders smugglers loggers arab tribesmen cheese makers and the one dyer of fabrics his great grandfather the mystic
7450890 in israel miryam was lost never learning hebrew and even though her neighbors would sit around and speak of children she wouldnt mention that two of her sons were university professors her two daughters teachers another son a vice principal of a school and another a bank officer for fear that boasting tempts the evil eye
7450891 in 2005 father and son traveled to zakho together a dangerous time for americans and jews in iraq and were greeted with kindness many people remembered sabars grandfather and could tick off the names of the jewish families they did business with and some spoke of missing the jewish presence the jewish neighborhood was now the poorest section of town and the shuls had become private homes the sabars realized that the generation that recalled jews fondly remembering the brotherhood they experienced wouldnt be around much longer

7450895 wir freuen uns ber diese wertsch tzung unserer t glichen leistung
7450896 wir stehen unter echtem zeitdruck da die entwicklung neuer fahrzeuge zum stillstand kommen k nnte wenn wir kein kapital zu vern nftigen preisen erhalten
7450897 der kongress hat dieses programm entworfen und wir hoffen sehr dass er es jetzt startet um uns bei der produktion technologisch anspruchsvollerer fahrzeuge zu helfen
7450898 mit dieser neuen anpachtung stehen uns jetzt insgesamt 26 628 ha land zur verf gung bis 2010 wollen wir diese fl che auf 35 000 ha erweitert haben
7450899 die olympischen spiele in peking waren f r adidas ein riesiger erfolg sowohl in china als auch weltweit
7450900 was markenpr senz w hrend der olympischen spiele angeht so waren wir in allen sportarten eindeutig die f hrende marke
7450901 wir sind auf dem besten weg unser ziel f r den konzernumsatz in china von mehr als 1 mrd euro bis 2010 zu erreichen
7450902 die erfolgreichen olympischen spiele in peking hinterlassen ein verm chtnis f r den sport in china und f r alle marken unseres konzerns daher bin ich berzeugt dass wir in den kommenden jahren weiterhin dynamisches wachstum in diesem markt verzeichnen werden
7450903 sollte eine l sung f r condor gefunden werden w re das positiv besonders nachdem der deal mit air berlin nicht geklappt hat
7450904 im aktuellen umfeld haben alle fluggesellschaften hnliche probleme wie die bef rchtungen um einen nachfrager ckgang da sind fusionen generell schwierig
7450905 wir werden die banken warnen dass bestimmte vorgehensweisen nicht akzeptabel sind und wenn es rechtzeitig zu nderungen kommt sind wir zufrieden
7450906 stark sind weiter die gesch fte mit servern speichern und damit verbundenen dienstleistungen ebenso mit notebooks viele us unternehmen expandieren weltweit und investieren in ihre it im ausland
7450907 im finanzsektor sehen wir nach wie vor einen guten absatz von speichern und servern die rechenleistung und der platz werden schlicht gebraucht nach meiner erfahrung kann man auch in zeiten langsameren wachstums gute gesch fte machen im ersten quartal haben wir bei den st ckzahlen im us markt 15 6 prozent zugelegt der rest der industrie verlor 1 5 prozent man kann immer noch wachsen wenn man die richtigen produkte und strategie hat
7450908 wir haben das im vierten quartal des vergangenen jahres geschafft im ersten quartal dieses jahres noch besser und auch im zweiten ich bin berzeugt dass wir das auch f rs ganze jahr schaffen
7450909 es gibt kein privatkundengesch ft weltweit das momentan schneller w chst als unseres das gesch ft mit privatkunden birgt viel wachstum f r uns betrachtet man dells umsatz dann haben wir in vielen l ndern im businessgesch ft einen marktanteil der zehnmal gr er ist als der im privatkundengesch ft
7450910 wir sehen gewaltiges wachstum im privatkundengesch ft immerhin haben wir im vergangenen quartal die st ckzahl der verkauften ger te hier um 48 prozent gesteigert
7450911 die menschen reagieren emotional besonders heftig wenn man ihnen etwas wegnimmt
7450912 das thema gesundheit ist den menschen einfach n her als die bildung
7450913 au erdem geh rt bildung zu den kollektiven g tern wo wir nicht direkt erkennen was wir f r unsere steuern bekommen
7450914 beim gesundheits wesen handelt es sich eher um eine tauschaktion man zahlt und bekommt eine klar definierte leistung
7450915 das kann man jedoch verhindern wenn die hauterkrankung rechtzeitig erkannt wird
7450916 denn hauterkrankungen entstehen meist ber einen l ngeren zeitraum erste anzeichen sind eine trockene und raue haut r tungen und juckreiz wer diese symptome beobachtet sollte einen hautarzt aufsuchen und auf eine m gliche berufliche ursache hinweisen
7450917 nat rlich ist der beste schutz den kontakt zum gefahrstoff zu vermeiden
7450918 da dies jedoch nicht immer m glich ist sollten die arbeitnehmer dringend den hautschutzplan beachten
7450919 in diesem fall hilft es zus tzliche hautschutzmittel aufzutragen oder einen baumwollhandschuh unter den feuchtigkeitsdichten handschuh anzuziehen

7450924 die bewertungsabschl ge der vergangenen woche bilden praktisch schon eine moderate schutzschicht vor den negativen konjunkturindikatoren die kaum noch berraschen
7450925 wenn die ausschl ge sich allerdings im rahmen halten und keine allzu gro en ausrei er dabei sind sollten die wirkungen auf den aktienmarkt begrenzt bleiben
7450926 w hrend die europ ischen staaten erst am beginn der konjunkturschw che stehen k nnten sich in den usa in den n chsten monaten anzeichen einer erholung zeigen deshalb wird das interesse der marktteilnehmer f r die fr hindikatoren der wirtschaftlichen entwicklung in den usa noch zunehmen zudem sollte sp testens nach der wahl eines neuen us pr sidenten im november eine leichte hoffnungsrallye einsetzen bis dahin werden die m rkte aber noch sehr schwankungsanf llig bleiben
7450927 bei aller wirtschaftlichen und sportlichen euphorie d rfen wir die situation der menschenrechte in china nicht au er acht lassen jedoch birgt das enge einbeziehen chinas in den globalen wirtschaftskreislauf mehr m glichkeiten positiv auf die chinesische f hrung zu wirken als das land zu isolieren
7450928 dieser prozess verlangt einen langen atem aller beteiligten unsere daten belegen dass die wirtschaftliche verflechtung sowie das engagement ausl ndischer unternehmen in china stetig wachsen

7450932 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7450933 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7450934 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7450935 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees

7450966 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7450967 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7450968 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7450969 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

7450977 you see a greater variety of handsets and more sophisticated capabilities because manufacturers can sell across the value chain
7450978 on top of that you see a greater number of applications that align with the handsets and the underlying technology
7450979 people say i want to be on the technology that has the innovation

7450988 i dont think its going to be as bad as a lot of people are calling for
7450989 im not as bearish as everybody else having said that i dont think the stock should rally on it who cares if youve got a bad outlook youve got a bad outlook
7450990 its just like sometimes you see some of the biggest rallies in stocks during the start of a bear market or even during a bear market
7450991 it seems like the slowdown in industrial world growth has finally cut the legs out from under the commodity rally for now
7450992 and now its really on chinas shoulders and the rest of the developing world to see whether they can hang in there
7450993 our own view is that china will do surprisingly well over the next year but whether thats enough to get oil prices rising is doubtful
7450994 the consensus is we will get some very modest growth in the second quarter were looking at all of a 0 6 per cent annualized rise in gdp which just barely offsets the decline we saw in the first quarter

7451001 aims to demonstrate a cost effective 1 megawatt hydraulic wind turbine with 2 megawatts of energy storage capacity
7451002 locally stores wind energy using a hydraulic accumulator in conventional high pressure pipeline storage banks enabling its use as on demand peak power
7451003 im not speaking idly if theres enough storage so that when the wind is not blowing you can supply for days or weeks then the necessity of using a carbon producing means of electricity will disappear

7451158 on the upsides the rs 800 level will be a resistance and a trend determination point once the stock actually manages to close above rs 800 consistently and trade on heavier volumes i think it would be a clear indication that the stock intends to go higher and possibly into the four digit mark i would recommend a long term hold on this counter one could even buy on declines below rs 675 levels

7451296 mr obamas great political ingenuity was very simple to trade moral leverage for gratitude give up moral leverage over whites refuse to shame them with americas racist past and the gratitude they show you will constitute a new form of black power
7451297 when you look at the u s senate with its 100 members and we have one black member and you see similar things in other institutions you understand the need for black politics
7451298 rose from a startlingly different place in the middle of the electorate in white communities
7451299 social and economic conditions and that hasnt changed much civil rights leaders are around because black people need somebody to help them deal with their pain
7451300 white people say youre the kind of candidate id vote for
7451301 their ambition is unbounded they see themselves getting elected governor senator even president
7451302 for many young people the idea of having some old timer like john mccain as president is more weird than having an african american
7451303 is a significant step but not the end of black politics one might call this a generational shift but the reality is that on thursday night we will be getting back to the carefully chosen words of rev king 45 years ago about the need to build a coalition of all colors and creeds

7451330 in the week before his passing yadav had been carefully completing homework involving the study of sea creatures and water and rainfall
7451331 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7451332 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7451333 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families
7451334 today provides peace for the family a lot of things had been going through their minds about what could have happened to him

7451348 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world
7451349 and we believe it will help them gain meaningful employment after graduation
7451350 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best online gaming for the greater society learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
7451351 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
7451352 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our online gaming for the greater society school
7451353 im really impressed by the planning that went into this online gaming for the greater society project were going to be offering a wholesome curriculum that will prepare students to meet the demands of the real world while developing their appreciation for learning
7451354 we desparately needed facilities for all our programs and the high school was running out of space now with this online gaming for the greater society school getting built and fields set to be operational next spring we will have plenty of space for people to recreate and enjoy team sports
7451355 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth
7451356 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all segers zoumis county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
7451357 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills

7451361 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent
7451362 if you want to make sure that question time is not a farce you would place someone in the chair that is an independent someone from a party that sits in the middle like family first
7451363 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7451364 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7451365 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7451366 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7451367 the downward trend now is firmly in place and we will go through those supports
7451368 with an rba rate cut cycle imminent that should continue to weigh on the australian dollar as well as the stronger us dollar and weaker commodity price trends
7451369 were not expecting the us dollar to continue to appreciate at the pace weve seen in the past month but were looking for it to strengthen over the medium term

7451381 mashhadani left al hussein medical centre on sunday night after treatment he was in good health
7451382 we love the show thats what motivated him to go ahead and try to be on it
7451383 dan is more of the action guy and andrew is more of a thinker a little more low key but very funny in his own way
7451384 they pretty much were trying to show the producers who they were what kind of people they were
7451385 i wasnt surprised when they sent in the video i was surprised when they called back and wanted another one they get thousands of videos for this show and i thought hed never hear back from them
7451386 we werent allowed to know where he was how long he was in the race we were called by producers just to let us know that he was safe and that he wasnt harmed and was healthy
7451387 were going to have to watch the show like everyone else
7451388 for someone in wilmington to be in this show i think is a really cool thing for delaware
7451389 hopefully people will be rooting for dan knowing that hes a delaware boy born and bred
7451390 we had a great tradition at sanford in athletics and that was my foundation for my competitive spirit
7451391 we had no hope of anything happening the way it did
7451392 we just wanted to say we did it i dont like to not try things
7451393 i knew that they would not be interested in a scripted thing with music and all that sort of stuff i knew that we should just sell our unique personalities
7451394 we took them on a tour of the fraternity house and then we went to a bar in tempe ariz
7451395 andrew was trying to put his moves on a girl and we had a video of him getting absolutely shot down it wasnt set up at all we just asked a random girl he was using these lame pick up lines and i was just looking at him like what are you doing you couldnt have scripted that
7451396 theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
7451397 you have to know danny to know danny but when danny gets his mind on something he can accomplish whatever he wants and danny loves traveling
7451398 its very exciting not knowing what lies ahead of you what kind of culture youre going to be seeing
7451399 the surprise was so much fun i just wanted to start so badly i had so much adrenaline
7451400 so again he was on the opposite side of the spectrum from me
7451401 and 30 pounds sounds like a lot but i didnt have anything else to do while i was waiting i was literally going to the gym every day it was real easy for me to be motivated by this kind of experience how can you not be
7451402 youre in so many social situations where youd love to bring up the topic and you cant i was very mentally disciplined and i lied i made up a complete story about where i was i told people i was doing habitat for humanity in the suburbs of mexico city
7451403 they cant believe my face is plastered across the cbs web site and im going to be in this its just complete and utter shock and disbelief
7451404 the important thing for me was to go about my life in a normal capacity
7451405 i got this job at the grand hyatt in washington about five weeks ago its a really good opportunity to be with a good company in a good city and i feel fortunate to have landed the position
7451406 they never told you what to say theres so many times you forget that cameras are in your face the adrenaline is going youre just trying to get to this place as fast as possible
7451407 we werent allowed to know where he was how long he was still in the race we were called by producers just letting us know that he was safe and he was ok
7451408 not only would it be unfair to cbs to say something but it also would be unfair to myself and everyone else it would be like watching a football game on tv when you already know the score i want people to go into it blindly
7451409 i like trying things to see what happens if you dont try you never know
7451410 i tried my best if it wasnt good enough so be it

7451416 he subsequently sent us information but it is not science information at all a lot of it is opinion from various people abut the threat to dolphins from fishing so the committee felt he had made a decision he couldnt actually back with sound science
7451417 the tikanga maori house has arrived it is a reality its influence will grow and the number of seats grows and were hoping this year and working towards this that there will be a much greater contribution to the house as a consequence of the party vote
7451418 maori media is there its got its own kaupapa which is to try and tell the stories of its community but the maori community is not in isolation if we live here in new zealand we have connections theres going to be different stories that are relevant theres always a place for different people to put out connections really
7451419 i think theyve got as good a chance as any danny lees obviously the form player worldwide but jarrod pender and james gill are very good back up dont worry about that
7451420 if the maori party were active in local body elections then i think we would get much better quality representation and theres some major issues around the environment and the role of maori for kaitiakitanga that cuuld be driven up as an election issue for local bodies so id really like to see the maori party getting active there

7451480 she always puts her family first even though barack obamas platform is change part of the change that i have witnessed is a refreshed commitment to very traditional family values the two of them as a team seem to be very strong and very compassionate towards each another and just so passionate about their views and their beliefs

7451489 youre going to have complete strangers in your home and a lot of the time theyre not going to love your home as much as you do what we find is that one of the spouses usually loves the idea the other doesnt the one who doesnt tends to be pretty stressed out the whole time

7451500 i saw things that hurt my head before i passed out
7451501 i i wasnt sure at first i thought i was just hallucinating but the more i thought about the things i saw the clearer they became
7451502 there was a bat it came out of nowhere and and just struck down on me
7451503 and there was this voice this voice of some guy one minute it was gentle the next it was full of anger
7451504 theres nothing wrong with you kame they were probably just hallucinations
7451505 you woke up last night from a nightmare we sat around for nearly ten minutes talking about it dont you remember
7451506 gaki san i really dont know what youre talking about
7451507 hey nakazawa san i just got off the phone with kames parents
7451508 well its a long story i mean i guess it isnt since it can be considered a recent issue um well this is whats up
7451509 eri saw and heard some things before she passed out that day very violent things i think she was hallucinating but shes had nightmares about similar things in the past i tried asking her parents about it but they said theyve told me everything they knew
7451510 what really bugs me is what kind of bike accident would cause such a horrible head injury
7451511 hmm youve got a real dilemma on your hands huh
7451512 buuut the things that she saw could of happened to her and i might be way off here but maybe her parents are trying to hide it from you girls i mean what parent would want their child to remember such a brutal abusive past if that was past of course
7451513 why didnt i think of that but that would mean
7451514 i mean what if were wrong either way its horrible
7451515 do some research this is home town right someone around here must know about what happened to her
7451516 leave kamei chan with us im sure tanaka chan wouldnt mind looking after her
7451517 niigaki chan here offered to help me make some deliveries around town for the next few days in exchange for pay
7451518 gaki san youre short on cash why didnt you tell me
7451519 kame you still have a lot to see around town
7451520 let me help nakazawa san out for a few days and ill walk around town with you again after that
7451521 dont worry kamei chan tanaka chan will keep you company
7451522 this is for the good of everyone you kamei chan niigaki chan and hell even me im tired of seeing you so depressed over this situation and lets put it this way lying is bad
7451523 okay youre not lying then youre hiding thats what youre doing youre hiding youre avoiding the issue and its only making things worse
7451524 youre wrong eri is happy the way she is she has niigaki san by her side there is no way knowing the past would make her happier
7451525 tell me are you happy seeing her with niigaki chan
7451526 no i cant stand to see her with someone else
7451527 but dont you see shes not im not her girlfriend anymore im not her anything

7451532 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7451533 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7451534 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7451535 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7451540 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it

7451571 you know it is kind of hard to see like that i mean since you saw my thong i think its only fair i get to see the bulge in your pants
7451572 what if i show you what you dont see will you show me what i dont see

7451574 oh oh yes here let me get out of your way
7451575 however the thai story at the games is as ever about far more than the medals won it is instead about the stories of thai officials allegedly trying to sell the country by lobbying officials to make sure thai boxers lose their fights endless controversies concerning whether the right results were determined in points scoring events stories of nuns monks orphans and changes of name to change luck and destiny
7451576 anyway despite malaysia ranked 75 on the medal tally i am still happy and proud that at least we won something
7451577 gold is expensive so china can only afford to give us silver
7451578 this morning i saw the awarding ceremony for wushu and the philippine national anthem being played for the first time in the beijing olympics i was emotional and proud of willy wang our only gold medalist in this year s olympics
7451579 i do hope that wushu becomes an official olympic sport because pinoy athletes are one of the best in that sport i guess we just have to wait for the 2016 olympics because i just read online that the 2012 london games didn t consider wushu it even scrapped baseball and softball
7451580 i do wish that our philippine sports officials will set their priorities funds should be given to sports associations that would enable pinoys to get gold medals in the olympics

7451588 i want shorter better focused numbered questions not a stream of consciousness
7451589 a brief history of time aroused a great deal of interest but many found it difficult to understand i decided to write a new version that would be easier to follow i took the opportunity to add material about new developments and i left out some things of a more technical nature
7451590 the result is a book that is slightly briefer but its made plain more accessible i would hope that people who have difficulty with a brief history will try a briefer history and be pleasantly surprised
7451591 i put a lot of effort into writing a briefer history at a time when i was critically ill with pneumonia because i think that its important for scientists to explain their work particularly in cosmology this now answers many questions once asked of religion
7451592 evolution has ensured that our brains just arent equipped to visualise 11 dimensions directly however from a purely mathematical point of view its just as easy to think in 11 dimensions as it is to think in three or four
7451593 naturally interested in space and not afraid to ask why
7451594 when we understand string theory we will know how the universe began it wont have much effect on how we live but it is important to understand where we come from and what we can expect to find as we explore
7451595 i may have been a bit nervous but i was sure of my ground hoyles theory predicted the masses of particles would be infinite i had seen a copy of the paper and had calculated it
7451596 in the past there was active discrimination against women in science that has now gone and although there are residual effects these are not enough to account for the small numbers of women particularly in mathematics and physics
7451597 it is generally recognised that women are better than men at languages personal relations and multi tasking but less good at map reading and spatial awareness it is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that women might be less good at mathematics and physics it is not politically correct to say such things and the president of harvard got in terrible trouble for doing so but it cannot be denied that there are differences between men and women of course these are differences between the averages only there are wide variations about the mean
7451598 it is no good getting furious if you get stuck what i do is keep thinking about the problem but work on something else sometimes it is years before i see the way forward in the case of information loss and black holes it was 29 years
7451599 it is a waste of time to be angry about my disability one has to get on with life and i havent done badly people wont have time for you if you are always angry or complaining
7451600 the simpsons appearances were great fun but i dont take them too seriously i think the simpsons have treated my disability responsibly
7451601 if human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory everything would have been solved by previous generations nothing would be left to be discovered
7451602 that was true of one speech synthesizer i had but the one i use normally has only one voice it is 20 years old but i stick to it because i havent found better and because im known by it worldwide
7451603 not entirely an awful lot of the arts world is mediocre or sham but there are a few great works that have a direct effect on people

7451701 grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
7451702 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7451703 perhaps in our own day it would be possible too to think of a new oxford movement a retrieval of riches which lay within your own household this would be a re reception a fresh recourse to the apostolic tradition in a new situation
7451704 it would not mean a renouncing of your deep attentiveness to human challenges and struggles your desire for human dignity and justice your concern with the active role of all women and men in the church rather it would bring these concerns and the questions that arise from them more directly within the framework shaped by the gospel and ancient common tradition in which our dialogue is grounded
7451705 full visible communion as the aim of our dialogue has receded further and that our dialogue will have less ultimate goals and therefore altered in its character
7451706 this leaves me all the more saddened as i have now in fidelity to what i believe christ requires and i want to add in the frankness which friendship allows to look to the problems within the anglican communion which have emerged and grown since the last lambeth conference and to the ecumenical repercussions of these internal tensions
7451707 i would like to address a series of ecclesiological issues arising from the current situation in the anglican communion and to raise some difficult and probing questions
7451708 so i raise these questions not in judgment but as an ecumenical partner who has been deeply discouraged by recent developments and who wishes to offer you an honest reflection from a catholic perspective on how and where we can move forward in the present context
7451709 it also seems to us that the anglican commitment to being episcopally led and synodically governed has not always functioned in such a way as to maintain the apostolicity of the faith and that synodical government misunderstood as a kind of parliamentary process has at times blocked the sort of episcopal leadership envisaged by cyprian and articulated in arcic
7451710 troubled and saddened when we ask in such a scenario what shape might the anglican communion of tomorrow take and who will our dialogue partner be
7451711 how might arcics work on the episcopate the unity of the church and the need for an exercise of primacy at the universal level be able to serve the anglican communion at the present time
7451712 we would see the anglican communion as moving a considerable distance closer to the side of the protestant churches of the 16th century and to a position they adopted only during the second half of the 20th century since it is currently the situation that 28 anglican provinces ordain women to the priesthood and while only four provinces have ordained women to the episcopate an additional 13 provinces have passed legislation authorising women bishops the catholic church must now take account of the reality that the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate is not only a matter of isolated provinces but that this is increasingly the stance of the communion
7451713 nevertheless i rejoice in the cardinals opening paragraphs in which he speaks of his hope to remain in serious dialogue in search for full unity so that the world may believe

7451722 five years ago when i first moved to washington i really liked john mccain
7451723 i understand what hes doing hes making the election a referendum on obama its constant negative advertising every couple of days they launch a new advertising campaign accusing obama of some idiotic thing its loathsome
7451724 obama is extremely talented extremely capable and has great political skills im drawn to really talented orators and he is one of the best ive ever seen
7451725 but obama has to start getting his hands dirty he should be doing everything in his power to make this election a referendum on conservative rule

7451769 it is interesting to note that the tendency to use savings to purchase tangible assets such as land is sometimes socially unproductive the preference for land as an asset for prestige and other social reasons may thus act as an instrument of dissaving and hence a brake on the national capacity to save

7451794 local people and shopkeepers have a number of concerns but this type of advertisement indicates that netto is not interested in their views

7451823 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7451824 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7451825 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7451826 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7451827 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7451828 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7451829 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event

7451831 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7451832 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7451833 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7451844 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent

7451846 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7451847 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7451848 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7451849 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7451850 in the week before his passing yadav had been carefully completing homework involving the study of sea creatures and water and rainfall
7451851 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7451852 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7451853 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families
7451854 today provides peace for the family a lot of things had been going through their minds about what could have happened to him

7451896 my task is to ensure that the south african public buys into the idea that the world cup belongs to all south africans
7451897 this alleged liability is historic and relates to a period of time prior to gold fields purchasing the company wal
7451898 wals preliminary assessment is that it has strong defences to these claims and accordingly wals attorneys have been instructed to vigorously defend the claims

7451916 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7451917 we demand that those holding abdifatah mohammed elmi nigel brenan and amanda lindhout free them unconditionally and immediately
7451918 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding three journalists and their driver
7451919 they were simply doing their job of reporting the story and presenting the plight of somali people to the world
7451920 if a firearm is found in a country it should be traced back to its origin the issue of small arms must be addressed in a more holistic approach
7451921 the aspect of good governance should be looked into very critically
7451922 the economic conditions too need to be improved to reduce the demand for illegal arms
7451923 ive been seeing articles implying that sun may have trouble now that it has been determined that the unix copyrights belong to novell entire minnesota town removed from google street view
7451924 prudence is required in somalia where the situation is complex and journalists and humanitarian aid workers are often abducted by militias acting with very diverse motives
7451925 but we hope that the broadest possible diplomatic effort and the help of mogadishu clan chiefs will result in the safe release of the three journalists and their driver very soon
7451926 we have so far destroyed 300 tonnes out of the 650 tonnes collected for destruction at out nakasongola military facility the remaining 350 tonnes will be destroyed in two weeks time
7451927 we are destroying these items because we want to create room for new ordinance military hardware secondly we dont want terrorists to access them in order to cause havoc among the population
7451928 unamid is one family and you must be prepared to work together with other countries this is what makes peacekeeping unique
7451929 let us remain committed let us work for peace in darfur

7451934 although ive heard oto members put out different interpretations i myself believe and have had members of us grand lodge confirm that the only
7451935 the moment of ultimate self embarrassment is when you die that is when you wake up
7451936 from the fire of cremation to the waters of the great sea by formula and verse did we rejoice him on his way

7451948 its a great feeling when you have actually found the dress you will wear on your wedding day
7451949 no one gets advance notice when the federal government calls
7451950 its well worth it to see the smiles on the brides faces
7451951 we miss so many great days and for them to make this day special means a lot
7451952 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7451953 so i ask you to work as hard for senator obama as you did for me
7451954 a unified party united in unity together as one undivided
7451955 we are fully confident that senator clinton will do the right thing
7451956 this whole business of trying to make money is one thing
7451957 but you also have to think about how to serve the community you take that land and you sell it off and use that money and then you have nothing its gone the fairgrounds belong to the public and we need to preserve that
7451958 a soap opera which resulted in the most incredible amount of bitterness that i have seen from both sides
7451959 an exciting new neighborhood in san jose to live work and shop
7451960 the land is not there to make money the land is there to improve the quality of life for the county
7451961 these are the kinds of things the fairgrounds facility has provided for the opportunities for cultures to meet and interact

7451966 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7451967 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7451968 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7451969 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7451970 especially in of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7451971 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7451972 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7451973 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7451974 he is seeing the ball well he is taking bad pitches and not missing good pitches he is hitting it hard really hard
7451975 he is a calm guy a pretty determined rookie and probably competes as well as anybody every pitch
7451976 i know but he doesnt know what he likes hes too young to know that whats in the long run is best for him
7451977 i have to give it to him he has been working hard
7451978 if you can get that into them young and they have success with it you dont have to worry about instilling that in them in the future once they get it young they get it and they have it most guys dont get it until they get older especially if they have success without working hard
7451979 he bunted on his own and we didnt put it on
7451980 i talked to him about it explained it told him i said youre the hottest hitter on this team right now and we wanted you to hit away dont think for yourself well help you hey its part of learning
7451981 ya se est n poniendo de acuerdo con felipe calder n y est n preparando el escenario para que se imponga una reforma privatizadora pero se trata de un asunto que no van a resolver ellos solos porque se trata de un tema en el que est involucrado todo el pueblo de m xico
7451982 voy a convocar a todo el pueblo de m xico a una movilizaci n nacional a una resistencia civil pac fica porque no vamos a permitir ni un albazo ni un madruguete legislativo que est encaminado a aprobar modificaciones a leyes secundarias o a la ley reglamentaria del art culo 27 constitucional
7451983 no lo van a lograr porque estamos hablando de un asunto que no es exclusivo de las c maras sino de todo el pueblo
7451984 vamos a ejercer el derecho constitucional a la manifestaci n porque la libertad no se implora la libertad se conquista
7451985 vamos a hacer valer los derechos del pueblo y vamos a defender el patrimonio de la naci n
7451986 se debe buscar la participaci n de la iniciativa privada mexicana en aquellas reas en donde no este prohibido por la constituci n
7451987 no sabemos vamos a esperar no s si voy a aguantarles si voy a resistir pol ticamente a nuestros adversarios que nos quieren destruir pol ticamente
7451988 si no me han destruido pol ticamente pues hay esa posibilidad pero si estoy desgastado pol ticamente puede haber otro porque no soy un ambicioso ni lucho por cargos p blicos yo voy a seguir luchando por mis principios y mis ideales
7451989 he came in between innings and said he was developing some stiffness and soreness in the back of his elbow
7451990 thats right where the triceps tendon comes into the elbow johnny being as young as he is at this point of the season logging as many innings as he has 155 we want to err on the side of caution take no chances
7451991 cordero had to leave and go home due to a personal matter
7451992 we gave em the first three runs on errors and didnt get a hit after the sixth inning
7451993 doing that and making five errors seasons high makes it awfully hard to win a game
7451994 the russians are definitely putting the biggest effort into the north
7451995 they built it up more theyre further ahead on resource development and they also have the largest icebreaking fleet
7451996 the longer they stay out the longer the russians are able to consolidate their position to their advantage

7452030 in the week before his passing yadav had been carefully completing homework involving the study of sea creatures and water and rainfall
7452031 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7452032 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7452033 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families
7452034 today provides peace for the family a lot of things had been going through their minds about what could have happened to him
7452035 it also provides peace for police and the community who have had strong feelings about this situation knowing it could have happened to any of their children

7452056 this mailing was prepared published and mailed at taxpayer expense
7452057 department of the interior environment and related agencies appropriations act of 2006
7452058 wisconsin and four other midwest states have become the epicenter of a spreading arms race between corporate interests trial lawyers ideological groups and political partisans who are committed to bending judges to their will
7452059 business groups have engaged because they finally got tired of being slapped around and seeing hard work in legislatures overturned by activist courts
7452060 thats why you have seen so much attention in the past 10 20 years from both sides on supreme court races
7452061 since the multinational corporations and their front groups like dan peros ajp cant win through public opinion they are spending millions on smear campaigns and attempting to just buy courts that will rubber stamp their anti family agenda
7452062 the thinking is if you took away the financial incentives for having your judges on the court you would dry up the money
7452063 third party issue groups who dont have to be accountable dont have to follow campaign laws and dont have to disclose their donors siphoned huge amounts of money into this race
7452064 ive said it throughout the race this system is broken

7452067 i think you lose credibility with people if you start saying were going to still win this thing
7452068 that makes no difference to me to me its like playing hard and hustling thats a no brainer thats automatic so to play each game and every game hard and play every game to win it should be a no brainer for me thats just the way it is
7452069 theyre playing their tails off theyll be right back in the thick of things next year
7452070 but im hitting early just trying to stay as sharp as i can i just tried to stay quiet not be too quick relax and not try to make up for lost time just try to have fun one at bat at a time
7452071 mr hunter is presently exploring any and all legal options available to him to defend his name and reputation against the allegations made against him including filing charges with the wayne county sheriffs department
7452072 women have far more options and arent tied to wearing stuffy suits and ties they can come to work with bare legs and no one will complain
7452073 you guys dont realize how lucky you are those suits keep you warm while we sit at our desks freezing and you dont waste nearly as much time thinking about whether things match
7452074 have the short end of the deal when it comes to summer attire at the office
7452075 although a dress code exists for both men and women my experience has shown that it is usually enforced more rigidly for men than women
7452076 maybe it is just my imagination or just that managers find it easier to enforce
7452077 men have less choice which makes it much simpler to get dressed in the morning
7452078 women have far too much choice so it becomes far more confusing
7452079 to be perfectly honest the rules are a bit more lax when it comes to women
7452080 theres inappropriateness in womens dress at the office and that applies to winter too i think women are just using summer as an excuse to wear things that are less appropriate
7452081 if women didnt shave their legs then they might be a little better off
7452082 im not against casual dressing but if you want to be successful you have to look successful
7452083 if you go to work thinking about comfort all the time then maybe youre in the wrong profession
7452084 a man may think hell be comfortable but he may feel relaxed to the point of not being productive
7452085 if you polled the average guy on the street who knew anything about buyouts theyd say oh my gosh bell is going to stop investing the neat thing about this announcement is that thats absolutely not the case
7452086 were investing with discipline in growing markets and where we know we can win competitively
7452087 you cant run a good policy without a first class team
7452088 are they at the absolute best that they ought to be not quite
7452089 this salary structure seems like a clear recipe for mediocrity rather than excellence
7452090 indeed it its interviews with some recently hired staff economists the committee heard several comments like i didnt receive any other job offers so i accepted the position at the bank of canada
7452091 in most cases the problem does not appear to be a lack of analytical or technical skills but rather an insufficient understanding of what constitutes an interesting question or a useful answer from an economic perspective
7452092 the canadian taxpayer in the end has to decide do we need a world class research department at the bank of canada and are we willing to pay the price
7452093 only two papers out of 240 produced at the bank in recent years have been accepted for publication in top tier field journals and only a few others are currently under editorial review at such journals
7452094 many of the papers do not address questions of sufficient interest or importance to merit publication
7452095 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let

7452097 vanuit mijn ervaring bij het sterfbed weet ik dat de fasen theorie van k bler ross meer niet dan wel toe te passen is
7452098 ze kunnen het maar niet verwerken ze blijven maar hangen in hun verdriet nou hebben ze zijn spullen nog niet opgeruimd aan zijn kamer hebben ze nog niets veranderd zn jas hangt na al die jaren ook nog steeds aan de kapstok
7452099 dan wordt pas goed duidelijk dat ze geen afscheid kunnen nemen
7452100 god gave noah the rainbow sign no more water the fire next time
7452101 willen we dit eigenlijk wel wat moet dit worden komt het wel goed over wat we willen vertellen
7452102 wat ik verlies kan ik toch ook weer terugvinden dus ga ik er naar zoeken maar mijn dochter kan ik niet terugvinden die is gestorven die is dood en verliezen is daar niet het juiste woord voor dat geeft niet weer wat er gebeurd is het verzacht de harde werkelijkheid het is een eufemisme
7452103 in zijn leven door een bestaancrisis heen en daardoor is er vaak zoveel onbegrip en onjuiste inschatting
7452104 een spelletje kaart een voetbalwedstrijd een baan een belegging een naaste wie het tegen zit kan zo het ene na het andere verlies lijden
7452105 vader vergeef het hem want hij weet niet wat hij zegt
7452106 wanneer het verdriet hem treft dat eeuwig bij hem blijft
7452107 kom op ga dr eens even lekker tussen uit we maken allemaal wel s wat mee er zijn ergere dingen
7452108 wie goed zijn best doet menen deze on troosters veel bidt een programma volgt of een therapie ondergaat kan de ellende grondig verwerken zoals een shredder een autowrak klaar
7452109 elk verlies is een krenking er wordt iets van je afgepakt wij proberen als psychologen die krenking weer ongedaan te maken de schade te herstellen
7452110 de enige therapeut die ik wil ontmoeten is de therapeut die mij die kinderen teruggeeft en dat kan die niet dus is zulk een therapie voor mij bij voorbaat een maat voor niets
7452111 vrouwen gaan vaak anders met pijn en verdriet om dan mannen
7452112 ik lees dat er na vijf jaar nog ouders zijn die elke dag naar het kerkhof gaan
7452113 wil je hem zien nou dan ga je hem toch zien
7452114 hij beheerst nog steeds mijn leven omdat ik zijn dood niet kan aanvaarden
7452115 er was daar een pastoor in het ziekenhuis hij zei niets oma dijkstra de moeder van mijn schoonzus zei later dit was een wijze man want er zijn geen woorden dit stond in grote tegenstelling tot bisschop punt nu is ze gelukkig nu heeft ze haar plaats bij de heer zei hij ik heb hem eruit gegooid wegwezen heb ik gezegd
7452116 eigenlijk gebeurde dit omdat de heer het wilde zo begreep ik van de bisschop die woorden werkten toen volkomen averechts ik was in staat hem door het raam te flikkeren en dacht man ben je wel goed bij je hoofd
7452117 kan men zich eigenlijk wel goed voorstellen hoe ingrijpend zon gebeurtenis is voor een moeder
7452118 en je kunt je het ook niet voorstellen hoe ingrijpend het is voor een vader voor een broer of zus en noem maar op wanneer je het niet zelf hebt ervaren
7452119 de vaders die ik sprak staan net als de moeders aan de grenzen van hun vermogen om de pijn te kunnen verdragen
7452120 betekenis is niet alleen wat de dichter in de woorden legt maar ook wat wij zijn lezers uit zijn woorden opdelven
7452121 leven is onder woorden brengen van wat je voelt ervaart en daarmee betekenis verlenen aan wat je meemaakt
7452122 onder woorden brengen een wereld van betekenis ontwringen aan de chaos
7452123 maar ik ga niet akkoord en ik leg me er niet bij neer
7452124 wat het gedicht voor mij bijzonder maakt is de overhandiging zonder woorden door die friese student ik neem het op als een late dankbetuiging aan ene uit het oog verloren gever
7452125 waar mensen vervangbaar zijn door andere mensen is er iets mis met de emotionele relatie
7452126 dat lukt dus niet nooit is het gelukt om de dood van een zin te voorzien en nooit zal dat lukken willen we er de baas over worden dan moet dat anders
7452127 leven leer je pas als je niet vergeet dat je doodgaat als er mensen zijn die je daaraan herinneren niet door eindeloos de trom van de dood te roeren maar door je aan te moedigen vandaag te kussen omdat het morgen niet meer kan
7452128 help ons dichter leer ons zingen in de nacht of wat frivoler gezegd fluiten in het donker

7452133 they ran my credit through and were jumping up and down
7452134 elke dood heeft nu voor mij een eigen kleurenpalet net als elk leven
7452135 we kunnen er niet omheen in alles wat met sterven begraven en rouwverwerking te maken heeft zijn in betrekkelijk korte tijd opvallende en veelsoortige veranderingen opgetreden
7452136 en van de toepassing op elke rouwende van een systematische indeling van rouwfasen zou ik maar liever geen dogma maken
7452137 voorop staat dat een ernstig verlies nooit kan worden verwerkt men kan het met grote moeite na veel smart en rouw een plaats geven in het leven en dat is dan al heel wat
7452138 dat de dood iets schandaligs is wat eigenlijk niet thuis hoort bij ons
7452139 je weet dat het nooit slijt nooit vergoed kan worden nooit gebillijkt nooit aanvaard zo leven erg veel mensen met open wonden die niet genezen willen leegte en gemis dat worden de permanente bewakers van je hart
7452140 ik kan me vergissen maar in de dagen van mijn grootouders speelde de troost van de vervanging een belangrijke rol
7452141 een rijk palet aan inkleuringen als het over de dood en afscheid gaat
7452142 de modieuze mantel over het eeuwenoude verdriet waaraan levende mensen lijden in nze tijd moet je kennelijk rouwen volgens het boekje
7452143 is het verdriet aan het overgaan nee was het maar zo makkelijk
7452144 was er en zal er altijd zijn altijd blijven jouw liefste hoort bij dat perspectief laat je nooit meer los je wilt dat ook niet
7452145 vrijwel alles gaat langs je heen omdat je nu eenmaal vrijwel niets meer aankunt
7452146 he is deeply disturbed that this image has gone out he firmly believes it should not have been used it is wrong that a film promoting london should include myra hindley it is deeply offensive to most people for understandable reasons

7452234 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7452235 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7452236 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7452237 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly

7452295 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7452296 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7452297 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

7452300 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7452302 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7452303 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7452304 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7452305 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7452306 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7452307 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7452308 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7452309 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7452310 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7452311 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7452312 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7452313 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7452314 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7452315 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7452316 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7452317 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7452318 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7452319 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7452320 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7452321 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7452322 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7452323 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7452324 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7452325 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7452326 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7452327 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7452328 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7452329 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7452330 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7452331 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7452332 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7452333 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7452334 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7452335 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7452336 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7452337 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7452338 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7452339 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7452340 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7452341 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7452342 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7452343 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7452344 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7452345 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7452346 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7452347 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7452348 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7452349 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7452350 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7452351 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7452352 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7452353 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7452354 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7452355 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7452356 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7452357 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7452358 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7452359 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7452360 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7452361 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7452362 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7452363 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7452364 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7452365 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7452366 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7452367 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7452368 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7452369 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7452370 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7452371 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7452372 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7452373 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7452374 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7452375 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7452376 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7452377 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7452378 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7452379 nous saurons le 24 septembre le projet de loi de financement de letat
7452380 le 29 nous pr senterons le projet de loi sur le financement de la s curit sociale
7452381 des mesures extr mement efficaces qui ne toucheront pas les malades

7452389 and the capture capability from the pool of pilot plants now being established in the valley can be scaled up from there
7452390 the area has a good sedimentary basin environment to store greenhouse gases once they have been compressed into an almost fluid like state where when pumped underground are held in that state by natural sub surface pressure
7452391 we recognise that this favourable choice of carbon sink location is in a producing petroleum province so there are some challenges regulatory and operationally but any storage would be in strata well below known oil and gas production
7452392 the upside is that victoria is very well placed to benefit from the deployment of carbon capture and storage ccs
7452393 it has major emission sources concentrated in the latrobe valley which is adjacent the future major offshore storage opportunities in the gippsland basin
7452394 we commenced carbon injection in april have about 20 000 tonnes in place or about a fifth of our 100 000 tonne objective
7452395 the trial will run until at least 2010 and cost about 60 million
7452396 however that cost should not be extrapolated across the sectors commercial potential
7452397 the otway project is very much a research and development program
7452398 it involves considerable trial monitoring testwork analysis and verification procedures that would not apply for a fully commercial operation but which will help bring down the cost of commercial ccs projects in the future
7452399 how does somebody get the ability to send out mail with taxpayer money only in the years when hes running for reelection
7452400 at best theres something wrong with the law either city law or state law
7452401 his initiatives are larger hes created more programs and done more for the district this year
7452402 every mailing he sent out this year was directly related to an initiative he was doing
7452403 hanno arrestato uno dei nostri deputati qui allinterno del parlamento
7452404 now i can live with my children i can move and go anywhere
7452405 i havent got any plans to get married yet but i would like to
7452406 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent
7452407 if you want to make sure that question time is not a farce you would place someone in the chair that is an independent someone from a party that sits in the middle like family first
7452408 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7452409 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7452410 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7452411 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7452412 you spend half the morning getting briefed on every possible issue that might come up in your portfolio and then not get asked a single question
7452413 the downward trend now is firmly in place and we will go through those supports
7452414 with an rba rate cut cycle imminent that should continue to weigh on the australian dollar as well as the stronger us dollar and weaker commodity price trends
7452415 were not expecting the us dollar to continue to appreciate at the pace weve seen in the past month but were looking for it to strengthen over the medium term

7452420 una miniserie de cuatro noches de duraci n con una audiencia potencial de m s de 20 millones de personas
7452421 existen dos imperativos estrat gicos prioritarios en la convenci n
7452422 uno es hacer que la gente se ponga c moda con barack obama el otro es definir la carrera electoral con claridad estableciendo a obama como un factor de cambio y a mccain como continuaci n de las pol ticas de bush tanto a nivel nacional como en el extranjero
7452423 se trata de aclarar la idea de que las elecciones se realizar n entre dos candidatos y dos partidos pol ticos
7452424 no veo la alegr a que suele darse tras unas primarias
7452425 obama es un tipo que quiere unir al mundo pero que ha dividido al partido dem crata como nunca se hab a visto desde la guerra de vietnam
7452426 tomando en consideraci n las reiteradas peticiones de osetia del sur y abjasia sobre el reconocimiento de sus independencias incluidas las del 22 y 24 de agosto el consejo de la federaci n propone reconocer la independencia de osetia del sur y de abjasia

7452430 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7452431 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7452432 that makes up the software for our thoughts of the day
7452433 i wanted to get it so that it would break down easily and be lightweight for me
7452434 in the week before his passing yadav had been carefully completing homework involving the study of sea creatures and water and rainfall
7452435 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7452436 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7452437 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families
7452438 today provides peace for the family a lot of things had been going through their minds about what could have happened to him
7452439 it also provides peace for police and the community who have had strong feelings about this situation knowing it could have happened to any of their children
7452440 yes its violent we dont try to hide that but as publishers we see it as a fantasy game its fantasy violence its over the top its cartoony we also take the violence very seriously we are working with the age rating boards with pegi and with bbfc were not at the end of the games development but were working with them now to make sure that we dont go over the top
7452441 this is not only a good ride but a good cause
7452442 you wonder if they are going to be a psychopath
7452443 said jason dell a spokesman for starrez which has 250 college campuses as clients
7452444 i thought we could put the refrigerator here and then the microwave here
7452445 for me i dont mind partying as long as he doesnt come home really really late
7452446 and i guess another thing for me is i dont like it when people borrow stuff without asking
7452447 im more of a morning person and she was up until the crack of dawn
7452448 i dont think i honestly answered all the questions because i didnt want a psychopath
7452449 so i was like i never party because i didnt want to room with a big partyer
7452450 there were six of us and this was supposed to be a pampering day
7452451 we were enjoying massages steam rooms and the jacuzzi instead we have a sexual assault and feel extremely violated
7452452 were trying to plan this wedding and we cant get past this its so traumatic
7452453 i just hope that if anyone else has been assaulted that they speak up
7452454 i dont know where they got their information but we arrived within two minutes
7452455 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7452456 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7452457 a unified party united in unity together as one undivided
7452458 we are fully confident that senator clinton will do the right thing
7452459 its just a name they gave themselves theyre nice young people
7452460 its a great feeling when you have actually found the dress you will wear on your wedding day
7452461 no one gets advance notice when the federal government calls
7452462 its well worth it to see the smiles on the brides faces
7452463 we miss so many great days and for them to make this day special means a lot
7452464 sorry i didnt see your stickers say what kind of car is this
7452465 erm i am a bit ditzy a little clueless quite careless and can be quite blur
7452466 im really angry they are young 16 to 20 years old
7452467 they are too young i cant believe theyre doing that
7452468 i think this is important if people have a problem just give the money to them
7452469 safety is important i hope everybody has safety in their life
7452470 were feeling positive about these guys getting caught or at least we can make them have second thoughts about doing it again everybodys got to keep supporting each other and not letting these thugs get the upper hand its a major urban city you know crime happens we cant let it stop us from pursuing our livelihoods and make us live in fear thats no way to live im not willing to live that way
7452471 they were pretty uncertain about where to stand where to go what to do
7452472 they werent extremely confident in their actions the impression was that they had this idea maybe saw the news on tv and they thought about it a little bit but havent been at this very long
7452473 a good change because everything else in the world is going up
7452474 things were very different then but we were renting properties from anywhere between 1 500 to 100 000
7452475 we really dont have a good sense yet how this ones going to go because its hard to predict how our economy will be
7452476 during the 2000 u s open we rented places in the salinas area too and well probably be doing that again considering all of the hotels and motels will be booked to capacity
7452477 that year a three bedroom two bath home in salinas was renting for around 3 000 to 3 500 for the week
7452478 its good for the owners but its not an easy thing to do
7452479 youre going to have complete strangers in your home and a lot of the time theyre not going to love your home as much as you do what we find is that one of the spouses usually loves the idea the other doesnt the one who doesnt tends to be pretty stressed out the whole time
7452480 one thing about putting your home up as a vacation rental is that somebody could be going through your stuff while youre away
7452481 a peculiar fact about termite tapeworm fungus moss art is that it goes always forward eating its own boundaries and likely as not leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager industrious unkempt activity
7452482 he was up there in the clement greenberg category as a critic but operating on a wavelength so unusual that he was hard to peg which is how he wanted it
7452483 he understood film in a very immediate way he could see the plasticity of it the beauty of film in motion in a way no one else could

7452486 were getting married next week and this is supposed to be something theyd remember as part of the wedding preparation
7452487 arts and cultural event that catalyzes civic discourse by inviting internationally renowned artists and designers to create participatory interactive and dialogical site specific works
7452488 theyre furious that there were no ladders and other safety equipment available
7452489 as a landlord seaport the port of oakland is concerned about safety
7452490 we will be checking into this incident with the pacific maritime association and the terminal operator to find out what happened and what steps they could take to prevent this situation from happening in the future
7452491 this whole business of trying to make money is one thing
7452492 but you also have to think about how to serve the community you take that land and you sell it off and use that money and then you have nothing its gone the fairgrounds belong to the public and we need to preserve that
7452493 a soap opera which resulted in the most incredible amount of bitterness that i have seen from both sides
7452494 an exciting new neighborhood in san jose to live work and shop
7452495 the land is not there to make money the land is there to improve the quality of life for the county
7452496 these are the kinds of things the fairgrounds facility has provided for the opportunities for cultures to meet and interact
7452497 we are very excited to be serving the historic alviso community and are proud of our new school and want to share it with our neighbors
7452498 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7452499 so i ask you to work as hard for senator obama as you did for me
7452500 obamas strongest card is that he represents young america the future in other words against john mccain who speaks for the past so the republicans are now attacking the notion that he is in reality even an american
7452501 his problem is not so much that he is an african american in the modern political sense of being a black american it is that he is an african american in the literal sense of being half african and only half american
7452502 in obama californias rising class sees some of themselves theres a very strong identity for californians with the innovative flaky rootless and experimental
7452503 you cant go a day in hawaii without being with somebody from a different background
7452504 its a sophisticated complex of social relationships its never black and white always multi hues
7452505 he mobilizes his personal identity and experience as both black and white he understands racial identity always in the context of socioeconomic concerns
7452506 barry as we knew him then was soft spoken with a deep voice
7452507 wed sit in the dorm hall and talk about how we wanted to change the world we were a bunch of 18 and 19 year olds and disappointed in how conservative things were moving
7452508 he wanted to be in the kind of place new york city is where you walk down the street and turn the corner and youre in a new place
7452509 he brings both sides of the american story his father the immigrant his mothers side from the midwest
7452510 they deport them at any hour at 10 p m at midnight and in some cases they wind up in the street or they sleep in the offices of mexican immigration agents
7452511 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7452512 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7452513 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7452514 the lord god is a sun and a shield the lord bestows favour and honour no good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly
7452515 the handover took place on sunday at the verkhny lars checkpoint between georgia and russia
7452516 yes they lost a lot of athletes but they always have great athletes coming in
7452517 they have a great tradition in the system its out go the old and in come the new there isnt a lot of drop off in athleticism and talent experience yes but not talent
7452518 theyre unsettled in the quarterback and their strength is the running back
7452519 they have a couple of nice tight ends theyll probably use the key is to be ready to adjust
7452520 weve seen a ton of different looks that our defense gives us
7452521 they do so many different things different coverages rotations and blitzes weve seen a lot of good defensive football in camp
7452522 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7452523 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law
7452524 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7452525 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7452526 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7452527 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
7452528 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7452529 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7452530 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7452531 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7452532 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7452533 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7452534 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7452535 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7452536 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7452537 i had never experienced such a comeback in my entire career it shows the great sprit the team has we knew we had to thrill our fans tonight they were spectacular
7452538 our unity is obvious on the pitch we had to give a good image after the defeat in valencia we had to satisfy our fans
7452539 its great to start the season like this many of us including the coach were new last year and we didnt have a great start its important to begin the year with a title especially when you win like this
7452540 it was amazing the team worked very hard but it was difficult because valencia are a great team
7452541 we did not come into this match to get a sliver medal it was the gold we wanted so i am disappointed
7452542 for me we failed in 1996 in atlanta we won the gold and here we did not
7452543 but i am proud of my players they did everything we asked them to do but we were unlucky not to take our chances
7452544 they had one chance and they took it that is football
7452545 el problema es el patriarcado la sociedad dominada por los hombres
7452546 tirar al beb con el agua de la ba era
7452547 never admitted the full extent to which he cooperated with his captors
7452548 he took away the only leverage we had for getting those soldiers back why he was paying back the vietnamese for keeping quiet about him
7452549 one of the most despicable people i have ever had the misfortune to encounter
7452550 allows the media to make him out to be the hero pow which he knows is absolutely not true
7452551 it will never happen and john and his people know it

7452574 there is no truth in the report and all the arrested separatists are hale and hearty
7452575 dit soort malware is zeer verontrustend je kunt je alleen afvragen hoeveel gebruikers al verleid zijn om niet werkende beveiligingssoftware te installeren
7452576 de nigeriaanse overheid staat zeer negatief tegenover deze zwendel en probeert elke dag de betrokkenen op te sporen het ligt niet in de aard van de nigerianen om zich met dit soort fraude bezig te houden
7452577 mensen die hun geld opsturen zijn net zo schuldig als de mensen die om het geld vragen

7452579 amerikanen willen weten wat er in het leven van beroemdheden gebeurt en de spammers weten dit
7452580 de docenten zijn in een slechte stemming sommige van de lessen bestaan volledig uit powerpoint presentaties dus de docenten hebben geen toegang tot het lesmateriaal
7452581 in de meeste gevallen zijn het de docenten die klagen ze kunnen geen cijfers invoeren en de studenten zijn boos omdat ze hun cijfers niet kunnen bekijken
7452582 door de uitbraak moeten de scholen nu 260 000 dollar voor nieuwe virusscanners uit trekken
7452583 gebruikers van sociale netwerken moeten beseffen dat de informatie en fotos die ze in cyberspace achterlaten door anderen te zien zijn en een digitale tatoeage kunnen achterlaten die moeilijk te verwijderen is
7452584 er worden veel gehackte bedrijfsdatabases aangeboden maar de enorme omvang en kwaliteit van de informatie die bij best western is gestolen maakt dit wel erg bijzonder de russische bendes die in dit soort activiteiten gespecialiseerd zijn zullen de informatie zodra het beschikbaar werd misbruikt hebben in de verkeerde handen is er voldoende data om een enorme europese misdaadgolf te veroorzaken
7452585 a large number of supporters of laxmanananda entered the district headquarter town of phulbani in violation of curfew restrictions on their way to chakapada and targeted churches and houses
7452586 ze denken dat de dief een nigeriaanse achtergrond heeft hij lijkt in ieder geval helemaal niet op andy hornby
7452587 dat is interessant omdat we documenten van davenport hebben gezien waarin staat dat logistep elke keer het volledige spel wist te downloaden toen vonden we dat al ongeloofwaardig en dat blijkt nu inderdaad het geval te zijn
7452588 het is zeer zorgwekkend dat na een aantal grote incidenten en de publicatie van twee overheidsrapporten over schendingen van de databeschermingswetgeving er weer persoonlijke informatie is kwijtgeraakt
7452589 en laat websites de frames van andere geopende websites wijzigen om zo gebruikers te misleiden

7452591 for example as far as china is concerned the companies would still play by the country s rules but they would not go any further than those rules require

7452597 het ging nooit om het geld of de gratis telefoongesprekken het ging om de uitdaging van het verkennen
7452598 vandaag de dag geven ze computerbeveiliging op school en mensen denken dat als ze een cissp examen halen ze weten wat ze doen
7452599 ze kunnen misschien beveiligingsproblemen ontdekken en het gevaar van die problemen bepalen iemand met de hackergeest kan bijvoorbeeld zien dat drie minder ernstige lekken bij elkaar een ernstig probleem vormen ik wil niet al teveel generaliseren maar met name cissp heeft deze certificering ontwikkeld en veel geld verdiend door bedrijven te laten geloven dat hun werknemers dit nodig hebben ik ben van mening dat het in wezen waardeloos is
7452600 in werkelijkheid worden de meeste lekken gevonden via reverse engineering dan het doorlopen van de code
7452601 tegenstanders van opensource laten je geloven dat de kostenbesparingen van opensource ongedaan worden gemaakt door het feit dat men nieuw beleid en procedures moet opstellen voordat men tot uitrol in de onderneming over kan gaan in werkelijkheid kan men dezelfde principes gebruiken voor het beveiligen van de onderneming of het nu om open of gesloten software gaat
7452602 das gro e problem dabei ist die tatsache dass die medikamente eigentlich bei schweren k rperlichen leiden eingesetzt werden und ihre wirksamkeit verlieren
7452603 es ist bekannt dass die furucumarine die in allen m glichen obstsorten enthalten sind bestimmte enzyme in der darmwand hemmen und damit gewisse substanzen vom k rper nicht oder nur in geringem ma aufgenommen werden k nnen
7452604 das ist der interessanteste punkt f r mich eine erreichte effizienz von 75 prozent bei drahtloser bertragung ber die distanz von einem meter nicht einmal das akkupack eines laptops kann mit derartiger effizienz aufwarten
7452605 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7452606 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

7452617 the use of solar energy is very popular in germany sweden denmark and japan
7452618 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7452619 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7452620 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7452621 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7452622 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7452623 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere

7452626 she hasnt said thank you i dont know why i think its just rude
7452627 but im still happy i did it for the children and not anyone else
7452628 the place was extremely volatile as soon as we got into that prison we were confronted by people saying youre kidnappers youre kidnappers
7452629 that was the most dangerous part and we really had to be careful because if we were grouped as pedophiles we would have been lucky to get out in one piece
7452630 they were my darkest hours especially missing my son kains first birthday i felt like id let them down
7452631 as a parent i empathised with her plight and that of the girls
7452632 we were concerned with putting right what was a completely unacceptable situation
7452633 we havent had any communication with them at all if she hasnt said thank you i doubt she is going to turn around and offer to pay my legal fees
7452634 cinta itu tidak mengekang cinta itu dukungan bagi satu sama lain cinta itu keterbukaan dan pengertian makanya aku beri kebebasan penuh yang bertanggung jawab untuk suamiku agar dia menjadi suami dan bapak yang baik bagiku dan anakku
7452635 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7452636 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7452637 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7452638 some stereotype replication and susceptibility to natural ability stereotypes due to an overemphasis on biological determinism and modest recognition of less immediately apparent developmental factors exists
7452639 a complete explanation would include sociological factors such as geography access to individual coaching the costs associated with participation socialisation opportunities the availability of role models and the potential financial rewards in specific sports

7452651 sportsbloggsbybrooks 221 as a source of your infomation that th
7452652 all those who were killed are innocent people what did the children do what did the women do most of those killed are elderly people
7452653 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7452654 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7452655 nearly 39 percent of all female deaths in america occur from cvd
7452656 its nice to get a win especially on the road
7452657 with that being said though we still have a lot to do but i feel we have enough time to learn more about both sides of the ball through our non conference schedule
7452658 were honored by the choice and it shows that our program is well respected
7452659 we have come a long way since 2001 on the other hand there are many quality teams in the mac and a preseason poll doesnt mean anything come november
7452660 im thrilled to be taking on a bigger role in the broadcast booth for rocket football
7452661 i cant tell you how honored i am to have the trust and confidence of the ut athletic department the coaching staff and wspd as well as the support of fox toledo to be able to take on a new career challenge i promise all rocket fans that i will do my best
7452662 were very pleased that brad will be moving into the booth to become our color commentator
7452663 brad is a respected sports personality in toledo and we feel fortunate to have someone of his caliber working with our football program also we would like to thank a j sager for his many years of excellent work as our football analyst we will miss his voice on game day but we wish him well in his future with the tigers organization
7452664 we decided to seek bids for the entire university with the hope that with a larger number of students we could get lower premiums for our students
7452665 one of the biggest things is that the new plan was the lowest cost of all the proposals that we received from the various health insurance companies
7452666 another major advantage is that they offered us a two year fixed rate so the premiums will not increase next year they will be the same for 2008 2009 as well as for 2009 2010
7452667 and this is really a huge benefit because the average increases annually for students health plan across the country is usually about 10 to 12 percent
7452668 id say this way students wont have to worry anymore about increases next year
7452669 were also concerned about getting a good benefit and if we had stayed with the old plan if we stayed with maksin for example it would have cost much more
7452670 we are able to get more for our lower premium and expanded benefits so on the main campus in particular we have higher level of coverage for prescriptions because we found last year a lot of students were reaching the max benefits so thats been increased
7452671 weve been playing together for a long time the same high school and everything
7452672 were good friends and we just like to compete against each other and try to make each other better every day
7452673 it brings confidence to the field knowing that ive been playing with him forever
7452674 hes got my back this year is going to be a great year for both of us
7452675 we want to get just about everyone that is shaping the direction of ut people who actually dictate the policy
7452676 for a long time student government hasnt really got active to the direction of the university we kind of just let stuff go by barely speaking up
7452677 the senate is committed to obtaining a better understanding of what student centeredness is and where the future of the university is going and they are invested in the future of the university
7452678 from the administrative affairs committee standpoint they feel that they have the right and responsibility to make sure that all departments are seen held accountable to things they say and do they want to make sure that students are out on the forefront of all discussions
7452679 we are currently in the design and development phase right now so were developing the drawings as we speak
7452680 we know that with the merger there will be an opportunity for us on the health science campus it is a rather significant opportunity because of being in the health science focused environment
7452681 my expectation is that it will take a program that we regard as being excellent to being superior
7452682 the timing is excellent because of the fact that in 2001 our enrollment has grown by 75 in this college and so we came from about 850 students to about 1 500
7452683 it was of course a tragedy that happened but it wont change our plans
7452684 the negations and agreement pretty much were in place prior to what happened
7452685 im not much of an advocate of carrying weapons and such
7452686 i think those weapons can be used against you you just have to be aware of your surroundings use night watch a night time driving service ut offers i think thats important it is safer to walk in groups i dont think you have a concern that the environment is unsafe on campus
7452687 theres more security in the university than there is outside in terms of square footage
7452688 we like to think of it as an oasis here
7452689 powers outside the caucasus region should not seek excuses for tensions and instability in the crisis area
7452690 their destiny in the caucasus would definitely not be different than the dilemma they have in other regions where they have already created a crisis
7452691 the conflict between the two world powers us and russia are indeed subject of concern
7452692 we support peace and stability in the caucasus area and the crisis over there should be tackled within its own place
7452693 we however hope that wrong calculations and signals would not lead to renewed conflicts
7452694 the two sides stress the importance of discussions and cooperation in the six party process
7452695 as a whole we highly appreciate the performance of our sportsmen in beijing olympic games however given the potential of our sportsmen we can say that we could have won more gold medals in olympics
7452696 our wrestlers performed very well by winning four medals but we expected to win a gold medal in wrestling as well
7452697 the prime minister has a chance for a second mandate
7452698 ministers should change people when they have to if not i will do it
7452699 oh yeah theres some controversy about that something about human rights and pollution yeah thats it
7452700 as a result of explosion 14 cisterns with transit crude oil damaged
7452701 there are some patches that are not so much waterlogged but they are false so from a health and safety point of view we had no choice
7452702 nu va suparati doamna dar ce e in sticluta aia de cerneala pe care ati cumparat o m a intrebat o femeie imbracata nu excesiv de vulgar dar care isi facea cumparaturile in functie de cosul celorlalti e cerneala de sepia i am spus si cum o mancati nu se mananca asa i am rapuns puteti sa o puneti intr un sos de spaghetti sau sa o folositi daca faceti scoici
7452703 everything went well it was awesome its my longest flight with this wing if there are no technical problems its okay for the english channel
7452704 all of these things existed before but by bringing them all together we believe that well be leveraging their opportunities for creatively thinking of new things to do and new ways to help students be successful
7452705 these folks can all work together to coordinate their act to maximize their success
7452706 fye has over 1 5 million funding involved in support services for first year students
7452707 were very interested in trying to increase the number of women students at ut who major in one of these stemm area
7452708 the mentor program is designed to pair women with a mentor and upper class women or another volunteer and provide an opportunity for women to interact with women scientists faculty and professionals and allows students to interact with each other as well
7452709 the percentage of females in the fields in stemm is low and some of them tend to be in the single digits
7452710 welcome to our home were really excited to show you around

7452723 we must have public officials who will stand up and tell the people exactly what they think
7452724 our failure in recent years has not been the failure of the people to meet the challenges placed before them but rather the failure of both our great political parties to place those challenges honestly and courageously before the people
7452725 we have too often retreated behind our differences when no one really tried to lead us beyond them
7452726 theres less than 1 percent of the population in iowa that is african american
7452727 there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
7452728 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue we want to press the point that this is a moral issue
7452729 we were a goal down and we needed another i just forced my way through and thankfully won the penalty
7452730 i knew very little about it as i was upended and winded but credit to john he converted the penalty and we now have another chance to complete the job next week

7452744 people generally do not read an op ed written by an mc member of congress and then look at the advertisement for viagra next to it and assume that the mc therefore endorses viagra or that viagra endorses them
7452745 i break the rules every day when i send a qik or a twitter or post on a blog
7452746 in fact as soon as we hang up im going to commit an illegal act and i will send out a twitter post
7452747 im not an expert interviewer i realized i talked too much
7452748 first the only item we seek to address is loosening existing rules to allow members to post videos as a first step toward making the rules meet our constituents expectations regarding how they communicate with us in the 21st century
7452749 they have not updated the franking regulation for the 21st century with the emergence of new technology
7452750 as long as its official then we shouldnt have overarching restrictions
7452751 i dont see them disarming themselves when those rules would not be imposed on their challengers
7452752 tell me where i can and cannot communicate with my constituents and with the american people
7452753 in my opinion the ability to use the internet videos instant messaging etc to reach constituents and make government more accessible outweighs the potential for conflict of interest in this case
7452754 mario giordano ama alzare i toni perch ormai pu alzare solo quelli dato che lui davanti a berlusconi ha gi calato le braghe restando in posizione prona come gi fecero i suoi due predecessori maurizio belpietro e vittorio feltri

7452756 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7452757 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7452758 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7452759 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7452760 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth

7452763 this is a significant issue and they have to work to address it
7452764 these are some of the growing pains of a distribution becoming more complex they are building more and more into their operating systems and with that comes more complexity and more challenges but what i think is most important here is the response
7452765 at this time we are confident there is little risk to fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed fedora packages
7452766 may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
7452767 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent
7452768 if you want to make sure that question time is not a farce you would place someone in the chair that is an independent someone from a party that sits in the middle like family first
7452769 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7452770 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7452771 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7452772 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7452773 you spend half the morning getting briefed on every possible issue that might come up in your portfolio and then not get asked a single question
7452774 the important thing is not to think much but to love much and so do that which stirs you to love
7452775 i honestly and truly believe that this offense has started right where it left off last year
7452776 right now the running backs each have different strengths and they compliment each other very well
7452777 if youre striving for perfection all the time eventually youre going to get pretty good
7452778 we have a young team and it felt like we came out a little nervous
7452779 we didnt give the crowd anything at all to cheer about in the first half
7452780 there were certainly some questionable calls in the second half
7452781 i wasnt too happy with the free kick they rewarded davis with ultimately leading to their penalty kick
7452782 we definitely felt that we would at least split these first two games but it was evident today that our fitness level is not where it needs to be
7452783 also we are not winning enough balls and only playing in 20 minute spurts
7452784 hopefully we get back on track soon and build off last years good finish to the season
7452785 its no secret we are young but we do have some experience and have a good core of returning players
7452786 im excited with the addition of eight freshman and what they bring to the team this year and for years to come
7452787 i feel it is realistic to say we can win the wac
7452788 that is our goal going into every practice and game we are much younger than last years team but we have had good team leadership early on
7452789 ive been a small town boy my whole life so this has been new for me
7452790 ive been doing rehab but i cant quite bend it all the way yet ill be in a cast for six weeks
7452791 its actually nice to feel like you were born in a community
7452792 its so cool when everybodys cheering you on and recognizes you the fans were amazing for us
7452793 this was the greatest group of 25 guys you could ever play with
7452794 it meant a lot and its something nice to have but i would have given it to everybody
7452795 we need to learn early on in the season that its not only one person that can change the game
7452796 we made sure they went to class and now they have degrees to go with their rings
7452797 were in it to make sure these kids get degrees
7452798 the coolest thing is we had a group of kids who did it the right way
7452799 they excelled in the classroom on the field and its been really enjoyable
7452800 hes done his best theres a couple of scores that we might question but hes still an olympian still a silver medallist and still a champion to me
7452801 it was a great rollercoaster and its fantastic that people have been on it with us
7452802 i didnt even send out a single invitation you lot just all showed up
7452803 ive had a great campaign i want to thank all the supporters here and at home thats it thats the end of the fairytale for now
7452804 he zhang boxed well himself he had a hard draw himself
7452805 he done well and beat the russian and kazakh you cant take it away from him he done it there tonight
7452806 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7452807 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7452808 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7452809 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7452810 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7452811 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7452812 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7452813 one of my first parts in television was on the bill and its good to back playing a completely different character this time around

7452815 i enjoy spending time with my family and friends here
7452816 it will be strange to see things change after this year
7452817 one of the first things that enters my mind about college is cost
7452818 im fairly certain i will be accepted to the school i choose but finding the money to pay for it thats the hard part
7452819 they just dont want to be stuck in debt for the rest of their lives
7452820 its not too late this year for students to apply for federal loans
7452821 we still have students who come in with questions about what types of loans are available to help with increasing prices
7452822 we recommend to students who have been with us multiple years to seek out department rewarded scholarships
7452823 students can check with the different schools and programs on campus to see what rewards are offered for the fall and spring semesters
7452824 we even have an express financial aid advisor this year who can answer quick questions in a matter of minutes
7452825 any little bit i can do to reduce my receipts is worth it
7452826 with costs already rising you have to wonder how high things will be four years from now

7452836 this kind of game doesnt happen very often its the first time i have experienced anything like this as a player or a coach
7452837 but we arent going to stop looking for new signings because of this win
7452838 it was my decision not to play him he continues to be included in the side because we need to see whats going to happen we hope that he will end up with us for next season
7452839 i couldnt find a logo file for download from the image library or anywhere else on the 2012 website whats at the top of this page is a screen capture from the 2012 home page
7452840 for example without the london 2012 organising committees written consent it is unlawful to use the olympic symbol the london 2012 logo or the mark london 2012 in the course of trade
7452841 the words protected by ospa can however be used in editorial news pieces without our authorisation and journalists are in certain circumstances able to use our emblem etc to illustrate an editorial piece about the games
7452842 this exception does not however apply to businesses which produce newsletters client bulletins or other marketing collateral
7452843 in england you never say first versus last is easy
7452844 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7452845 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7452846 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7452847 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7452848 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet

7452854 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7452855 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7452856 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story

7452875 reverent memories for our former longtime state senator jack backman heroic champion for fairness compassion civil liberties common sense and true straight talk especially sensible crime control
7452876 so i say to the filipinos to the world to our muslim brothers in the south to the oic through our kuwaiti friends there is no all out war what we are doing we are doing to have all out peace in mindanao
7452877 the rampage of some lawless milg groups in mindanao calls for resolute military and police action
7452878 the p10 million reward for commanders kato and bravo manifests the governments firm resolve to hasten the neutralization of these criminals so that justice can be achieved and we can move on with the peace process

7452881 ive seen what may be the best futuristic anthology series since the glory days of the twilight zone and the outer limits its called masters of science fiction
7452882 a fascinating read for anyone with an interest in the amazing world where science meets crime
7452883 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7452884 they want to stop the law enforcement activities but at the same time they continue to coddle and harbor those who committed atrocities not condemning it outright and this adds to the severe credibility problem which already faces the milf
7452885 i still do not want to stereotype each and every person of the milf as a coddler of atrocities or what not there is still some hope however be that as it may the unbargainable condition is that we will number one run after the perpetrators of the atrocities and second we will prevent a recurrence of these atrocities
7452886 nandito tayo sa tama ginagawa natin ito dahil gusto natin ilagay sa hustisya ang mga lumabag sa batas ng pilipinas as a republic tayo ba ay yuyuko o titiklop sa harapan ng mga banta na ganyan na walang kredibilidad palagay ko obvious po ang sagot doon we are on the right side we are doing this because we want to bring those who broke philippine laws to the bar of justice as a republic will we be cowed by these threats i think the answer is obvious
7452887 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably won t be a total drought buster
7452888 the water is very deep it s already at everybody s door
7452889 they were never presented with the evidence that tells the story
7452890 the photo speaks for itself its not me saying it the photos show there was no hole there was no hole
7452891 mr harris stole from the city of gary and its citizens because he could
7452892 either there was not a hole in july or there was the pictures show there was no hole in july
7452893 its difficult to accept but i am a religious man and i think its gods will
7452894 with the widespread rain were just going to have to wait and see in smaller basins and places that are more flood prone
7452895 we still have a ways to go as far as replenishing soil moisture and relieving the drought conditions
7452896 we just hope its not too much over too short a time
7452897 when there arent identifiable pieces sometimes we dont know right away what was working and what wasnt working
7452898 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7452899 people want to catch up on events that they miss
7452900 is that they want to resee and revisit the major events they had seen on tv earlier
7452901 every halloween the trees are full of underwear every spring the toilets explode
7452902 the insurance department should be extremely skeptical of rate increase requests in the face of substantial reductions in driving mileage
7452903 i dont blame people who go out of state and register their car
7452904 its not right to bring up the prices without having consideration for the people who follow the rules of the road
7452905 its a cyclical market but one where profit margins are not unreasonable by any standard
7452906 theres times when the industry sustains tremendous losses and needs to earn profits to tide it over for the bad years
7452907 we do still have an impact from more than two years of drought
7452908 its still going to take our water resources more time to recover one storm event probably isnt going to do it

7452911 were expecting the worst of the tropical storm this afternoon
7452912 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7452913 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7452914 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7452915 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7452916 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7452917 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not
7452918 when i went to work for him i said im going to get involved with you but i dont think theres any chance you can win
7452919 he said im going to win this it was the most extraordinary thing ive ever been involved with ive never seen a campaign anywhere that was as big an upset as this one
7452920 nobody wanted to run against caleb boggs he was running for his third term and was truly beloved joe went around and said i think i can win this but this was definitely a long shot
7452921 nobody says hell make it and then he goes out and plays and scores five touchdowns in his first game
7452922 he demonstrated to me that there was nothing he couldnt do
7452923 it was the worst possible thing that ever happened to us
7452924 they have a very clear obligation not to let a bottle with a defect like this into circulation
7452925 i was met by major opposition from nps national prearranged services of clayton and other third party sellers
7452926 theyve donated thousands and thousands and thousands to missouri political candidates if we had done something then we could have stopped this from happening
7452927 the system is so thoroughly broken its in a shambles its time for the feds to step in
7452928 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
7452929 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
7452930 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
7452931 communities that have not been circumcising their people should go for it but do so in hospitals where safety is assured
7452932 ceilings help slow down fires and then again there are materials that can be coated on timbers to slow down the spread of fires also schools should try to use burglar proofing that can be opened in cases of emergencies
7452933 todays most pressing issues of social and economic development require more than traditional philanthropy
7452934 our agreement with microsoft marks a joint long term commitment to help the most vulnerable in society with the most innovative appropriate solutions and technologies at our disposal
7452935 if we are to meet our goal of reaching the next 5 billion people around the world who are not yet realising the benefits of technology it is critical that we look at innovative partners which span communities and geographies
7452936 ive said publicly before the council should have three terms
7452937 but i think any change in term limits should go before the voters again
7452938 anthony has favored ending term limits but believes the right way to do it is by public vote
7452939 new yorkers voted it in and they deserve the right to vote it out if they so choose
7452940 right now theres a lot of speculation about whats to occur and i dont think the mayor has directly said what he plans to do
7452941 theres a been a lot of talk but i havent seen anything move
7452942 the force required to push that pencil through the graphene would be equal to the weight of an elephant or a small car
7452943 this is probably about 100 times stronger than the best steel you can buy
7452944 there can be no legitimate justification for hitting and striking a man who is handcuffed on the ground
7452945 hit me about two to three times in my lower back and in my neck
7452946 you dont get that kind of spray when youre ok
7452947 we were enforcing the security zone around the race and i noticed the water going everywhere
7452948 one of the race helicopters dropped a diver who was able to get the emergency hatch open and pull the victims out
7452949 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
7452950 we were the underdogs going into all of our matches some other countries didnt expect us to be as strong as we were
7452951 its far more gratifying to win a team medal than an individual medal
7452952 my first thought after losing was how could i have prevented it because there is always something that was within my control
7452953 now if i could only get her to have sex with me
7452954 mccain is doing much better in several areas than a lot of people expected and thats obviously good for us
7452955 there seems to be a reluctance on the part of a lot of voters to back obama and thats benefiting mccain and our legislative candidates as well
7452956 i think most new york democrats are concerned about obamas slippage
7452957 i feel mccain is going to be very difficult to beat hes been running a very smart campaign
7452958 i also worry that any numbers may not be accurate due to the bradley effect so we wont really see an accurate poll until election day
7452959 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7452960 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7452961 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7452962 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7452963 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope
7452964 they skidded between 1 000 and 1 500 meters yards

7452971 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7452972 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7452973 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference

7452976 tenant companies are more inclined to focus on outsourcing or software services rather than creating new innovative products
7452977 part of the reason is the poor levels of intellectual property protection that makes international companies reluctant to locate their core research and development in these countries thus creating a barrier to innovation and technology transfer
7452978 isolated parks in remote locations away from the commercial areas do not lend themselves as attractive locations for such talents
7452979 it is thus more important to create an overall environment in a country with positive factors that encourage innovation rather than creating physical parks to stimulate the software industry
7452980 when creating and enforcing a legal and policy framework that prevents anti competitive behavior and reduces business uncertainties
7452981 the rest of asia can similarly grow successful software industries but fundamental changes need to be put in place liberalized telecommunications better intellectual property protection more attractive investment environment and a technology neutral approach towards government policy
7452982 i am more than willing to hold a dialogue with them
7452983 the province had 997 000 registered voters in the 2007 elections so we need that number of signatures to muster the 10 percent required by the law
7452984 the issues raised are not valid on meritorious grounds to say that the people of pampanga lost their trust and confidence in me the civil society groups in pampanga are one with me in pushing for responsible governance
7452985 i may have a difference of position with some civil society groups in my insistence to retain atty vivian dabug as the provincial administrator but this is prompted by valid and justifiable reasons she is incorruptible hardworking and confident
7452986 yes hindi ako marunong maglaro ng pulitika i do not know how to play politics especially with power play misuse of funds but i love where i am now there is gods hand in the work that i am doing
7452987 the issue here is jueteng and not governance if its governance you can easily hold a dialogue
7452988 it is however interesting to note that the average annual revenue per line for zain has been lower than that of safaricom and remained around ksh13 000 200 except for the 2001 2002 financial year when there was a phenomenal growth in revenue
7452989 with over 50 licensed internet service providers and many other categories of operators get ting into this market the amount of internet bandwidth and the num ber of internet users has remained relatively low cck is currently carrying out a survey to establish why the situation is as it is but an obvious reason must be the low fixed line penetration for dial up services and the relatively high cost of sustained usage
7452990 you guys have all seen the rubbish thats been written in the papers in the last couple of weeks and its nice to just put it to bed now
7452991 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club
7452992 a lot of these classrooms have no bookshelves because theres no expectation of books
7452993 it allows the teachers to have in class reading mini book clubs and great resources close at hand
7452994 nicollette is terrific shes great its just this great cast
7452995 i was traveling everywhere i wanted to see my wife and kids
7452996 i was about to go off again and desperate housewives creator producer and writer marc cherry called and said howd you like to be the new guy its just a lot of fun and its nice to drive 3 5 miles to work get home and kiss my wife
7452997 theres definitely a past to the guy that no one else knows about and hes hell bent on revenge as the year goes on
7452998 to work with don and guy and jeff those guys are fantastic
7452999 its a very smart entertaining film this is one of those smart thrillers where you will never guess whats going on if you can guess you are pretty amazing its just really layered and thats what i like about it it was one of those characters that was just right for me
7453000 i generally play those hardened tough as nails type of guys i think thats what i am
7453001 lee marvin john wayne kinds of guys not a lot of bs about us we like to get to the bottom of situations not dance around issues these are the kinds of characters i like
7453002 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian sate
7453003 since we started to do these requests people have been getting quite sassy asking us to play things we havent played for 30 years
7453004 rendition and illegal wiretapping and other attacks on our constitution
7453005 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a heeler hes going to be
7453006 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7453007 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7453008 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7453009 bps have no legislative role whatsoever and the post should applaud the fact that our office encourages public private partnerships for the public good

7453020 for me i dont mind partying as long as he doesnt come home really really late
7453021 and i guess another thing for me is i dont like it when people borrow stuff without asking
7453022 im more of a morning person and she was up until the crack of dawn
7453023 i dont think i honestly answered all the questions because i didnt want a psychopath
7453024 so i was like i never party because i didnt want to room with a big partyer
7453025 podem ainda n o estar a ver as coisas superficie mas por baixo j est tudo a arder
7453026 they were staring at us making me and my wife very uncomfortable
7453027 i wanted to get out of there before any trouble started
7453028 he is screaming at me that he is going to kill me that i am a dead man
7453029 he is yelling at me saying that i am a rat
7453030 theres a certain high level of expectation at the open
7453031 there are a lot of a list people in attendance who are accustomed to a certain level of quality
7453032 he said how he wanted to kill me chop my body up and put it in a black plastic bag
7453033 he threatened to put me in a suitcase and take me to work and while he is on the ferry dump the suitcase
7453034 came after me with fists flailing scoring direct hit after direct hit
7453035 in grade 4 wed just moved to canada from china and everything was really disorienting and i didnt adjust that well
7453036 i used to do well in school in china but in canada i didnt then a teacher gave me another chance at a science test id failed
7453037 i studied really hard and excelled ever since then i took control of my learning and thought i should go after what i can do
7453038 i think its important that everybody find something to help them de stress for me that came surprisingly in the form of work
7453039 i am really concerned that the world seems to be getting worse and worse i hope that with my knowledge as a chemical engineer i can focus on the environment and use that knowledge to do something about it and improve the state of the world
7453040 i chose harvard because i wanted to continue with my experiences in different countries since ive lived in quite a few
7453041 harvard seemed a really great place to start something new
7453042 ive always tried to do the best i can whether in academics sports or whatever
7453043 if i can get into medical school down the road i might
7453044 i hear other kids say their parents make them do their homework but my parents never did i just always wanted to do well at school myself to do well in life
7453045 id like to be a doctor i dont have a specialty chosen but im interested in neurology
7453046 i had great teachers i just loved discussing ideas about the books
7453047 im using facebook to keep in touch with my university roommates who are all over the world
7453048 its something ive always tried my best in with all the support from my parents my family my grandparents its something i enjoy doing
7453049 i check it every day but dont spend a lot of time on it
7453050 i guess its just the way i was brought up my parents didnt push me to do well but they wanted me to do my best
7453051 i want to be a doctor im interested in cardiology but im not too sure
7453052 i only recently started it out of necessity to keep in contact with friends who are going away to university
7453053 partly my parents but for the most part its that i have a dream id like to fulfil thats the reason im working so hard id like to make a difference in the world
7453054 my parents encouraged me i realized i could achieve these marks as long as i worked for them
7453055 i go on facebook whenever i get an email a few times a week
7453056 my parents never forced me to study when i didnt want to and that helped me focus i have a lot of drive i really like to do the best i can i like getting good marks
7453057 ive wanted to become a vet since i was 8 years old
7453058 my brother who has spinal atrophy started going to sledge hockey and i really enjoyed it too
7453059 i dont check it every day maybe twice a week
7453060 when i was younger my parents definitely told me to do my best and after that i got used to doing it and just competed against myself and tried to do better
7453061 id like to be a doctor right now im thinking pediatrics or maybe trying the research side of it
7453062 the three maths were my favourite i like the logic you can always prove if its right
7453063 its something i naturally have if i want something i try as hard as i can to go out and get it
7453064 im hoping to become an actuary at an insurance company and beyond that work my way up in the company into management
7453065 i probably go on every day but not that long i use it to keep in touch or if i have school work to catch up on i ask on facebook
7453066 my parents always told me i can be anything i want and if i put effort into it i can do anything i want to achieve i always used to make goals for myself in grade 9 i wanted a 90 average in grade 10 91 it went up by one or two per cent each year i jumped a bit this year
7453067 ill probably further my studies and get a ph d
7453068 a lot of alternative stuff but i like almost anything
7453069 definitely my parents they pushed me a lot but not in a bad way it wasnt so much do well in school or else but they were always really proud and made me put school ahead of everything else

7453072 all the base elements technical things they are all base elements the reality is what makes an award winning image is emotion and so the judges are looking for the emotion
7453073 some people are just flies on the wall and can watch and they know the moments they can predict when its going to happen and they are there already at that point in time
7453074 other people make photographs they create the energy within the people so that when they make their photograph there is a lot of emotion happening
7453075 its not just a matter of turning up somewhere and hoping to get good photos
7453076 theres a lot of thought that goes into what are we going to do where are we going to go are we going to use props
7453077 people that are shooting from quite a long distance and just picking the shots off with a long lens and not being intrusive letting everything unfold and grabbing the moments as they happen
7453078 digital has really changed a lot a lot of people are experimenting a lot more
7453079 a hundred years from now formals are going to be really important photos so although the arty photos are fantastic and the candids are fantastic when your great grandkids are looking at your wedding album and they can see their great grandmother thats probably more important
7453080 if they are only showing you two or three photos alarm bells should start ringing
7453081 you need to see whole wedding days its easy to take five or six hundred photos and fluke two or three not so easy to get three or four hundred great photos out of six hundred
7453082 some photographers wont release the images some wont release for a while some release immediately theres no firm set rule there

7453128 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7453129 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials
7453130 surge is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
7453131 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7453132 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7453133 a comparison of the cia draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against iraq by inserting additional alarming claims in the manner of an advocacy or public relations document
7453134 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained
7453135 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war
7453136 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge

7453193 wla is a chat interface based on the interaction between a sentient human speaking to a computer with artificial intelligence capabilities to achieve a goal
7453194 it went beyond using powerpoint presentations to replace the transparencies and the old overhead projectors we wanted instead to bring about greater interactivity and engagement in the learning process
7453195 for example podcasts can help students practise different language skills from writing to speaking the technology allows them to play back their work so that peers and teachers can help them improve on pronunciation or grammar
7453196 we expect to see at the end of masterplan 3 a pervasive culture of innovative ict practices across all schools and a corps of specialist teachers in every cluster who demonstrate a deep understanding of how ict can transform teaching and learning both within and outside the classroom
7453197 with e learning our lessons can still be carried out online while school is closed should an emergency say avian flu hit us
7453198 one advantage of using newton is that if a student prefers to study late at night he can just log in and chat with newton and ask whatever questions he might have about newtons law
7453199 with wla they are more open about asking questions even silly ones it can be used as a revision tool with students asking the same question over and over again at their own pace and time
7453200 newton is a learning tool that complements the use of ict in our school curriculum it is not a substitute for teachers who will still have to check and make sure the students complete their work
7453201 teachers can print out a copy of the conversations between newton and students from there they can tell which student is weaker and requires more attention
7453202 if they are found to be surfing the net playing games or chatting with friends their computers can be locked or that particular programme can be disabled
7453203 newton is something new and interesting however having a teacher is still a good idea because it may not always understand what i am trying to ask
7453204 its a fun way to learn music they allow us to explore and create our own ringtone using modern technology
7453205 if i know how to make a presentation using multimedia tools my boss will be impressed
7453206 its about working on a project over an extended period of time knowing how to run experiments and coming up with good ideas of what to explore
7453207 kindergarten is one part of the education system that does a good job in helping children develop as creative thinkers if you look at the root of creativity its about creating things children in kindergarten spend a lot time creating things like a tower using blocks or lego bricks
7453208 we run our graduate programmes like a kindergarten first our work space is like a kindergarten we organise it in such a way that there are different play areas and sofas where students can sit down and talk
7453209 my graduate students are always making things we dont spend months planning something if we get an idea we make a little model of it we create something we try it out and get new ideas based on that the same way children are always creating things in kindergarten
7453210 its true that not every part of the world is able to buy even low cost computers today but my bigger concern is that in the future when almost everybody has equal access to the technologies only a small percentage of people will be designing creating and experimenting with them while the great masses will just be browsing and gaming with technologies

7453224 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
7453225 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohol s effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
7453226 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
7453227 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
7453228 we have a global it infrastructure so email runs this company from shipping to tracking to fulfillment if we lose email the company would shut down and that just cant happen
7453229 the growth in volume of pst files is a huge issue across our network with 10 15 gigabytes of pst files per user management of these files is time consuming and its a huge administrative burden for us we need to centralize the storage to reduce complexity and management costs
7453230 outsourcing became too complex and costly with too many layers so we wanted to bring everything back in house
7453231 mimosa provides dr and exchange backup right out of the box
7453232 this is as efficient as it gets and it will help me sleep better at night knowing that we will have an added layer of protection for the company
7453233 companies like jas worldwide depend on email as the primary business application and they need a unified archiving and data protection solution to ensure business continuity
7453234 nearpoint is the only unified content solution that can manage the discovery retention and protection of information across its lifecycle to limit exposure minimize risk and reduce costs

7453236 it is always nice to play well in front of the owner of the club it does help
7453237 i spoke to him earlier in the week and i was really excited by what he had to say i am sure he enjoyed the game
7453238 this was a big win for us irrespective of west ham going down to 10 men so early i felt we were in control
7453239 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7453240 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7453241 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed
7453242 given the personnel we have available i do not think we were equipped to play with 10 men
7453243 we needed to defend in the second half with our lives and the first goal is always important

7453250 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7453251 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7453252 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget

7453254 die aussagen von bz obmann j rg haider am sonntag in der fernseh pressestunde sind ein weiteres signal dass es nach der nationalratswahl zu einer koalition von vp bz und fp kommen k nnte auch vp chef wilhelm molterer hat ja eine dreier koalition nicht ausgeschlossen eine solche aber w re eine katastrophe f r die pensionistinnen und pensionisten sterreichs die pensionsk rzungspolitik der jahre 2000 bis 2006 w rde eine neuauflage erleben

7453259 ordnungsgem e abarbeitung des eurofighter desasters wird aber dadurch auch nicht zu verhindern sein
7453260 sollte darabos wirklich so wie in der berichterstattung der zib zu vernehmen war den eurofighter vergleich dem orf vorgelegt haben obwohl er sich geweigert hat dem parlament genauer gesagt dem landesverteidigungsausschuss den vergleich vorzulegen wird man sich ber diese verh hnung des parlaments und deren konsequenzen ber die parteigrenzen hinaus gedanken machen m ssen
7453261 mit dieser aktion haben sich die pseudo streithanseln von den beiden gro parteien erneut eindrucksvoll demaskiert
7453262 es zeigt sich einmal mehr die respektlosigkeit gegen ber jenen die durch die katastrophenpolitik der letzten jahre ohnehin schon in den finanziellen ruin getrieben werden

7453305 amalgam ist besser als sein ruf die aktuelle studie zeigt auf dass der f llstoff nicht sch dlicher ist als andere materialien es gibt und das muss man auch ganz klar sagen patienten die auf amalgam allergisch reagieren die amalgam nicht vertragen gleiches gilt aber auch f r f llungen aus gold oder aus kunststoff
7453306 amalgam enth lt quecksilber und das gelangt ber den zahn in den k rper dabei handelt es sich aber um anorganisches quecksilber aus legierungen und dies ist deutlich weniger sch dlich als organisches quecksilber das wir durch nahrung aufnehmen zum beispiel durch fisch
7453307 wer keine beschwerden hat sollte das amalgam auf alle f lle in seinem zahn belassen auch der austausch kann probleme mit sich bringen zum beispiel geht zahnsubstanz verloren und es gibt auch eine reihe von patienten die auf die neuen f llstoffe allergisch reagieren zum beispiel auf kunststoffe

7453325 it gives me great pride and happiness to see the establishment of a new xinhua finance library that will give underprivileged rural chinese young and old access to books and a chance to escape the confines of poverty through education i would like to thank the redcross society of hohhot and the qingshuihe county government for their support and assistance in realizing this library in addition to this i would also like to thank the committed employees of the xinhua finance group worldwide for their contributions it is only with their unwavering compassion and determination that the foundation has been able to extend what it has done in ningxia to inner mongolia
7453326 it is my utmost honor to be here today to express my gratitude to xinhua finance and welcome them to inner mongolia inner mongolia is a region on the northern frontiers of china rich in natural resources to tap these natural resources and further develop the region in the future inner mongolia will however require a large pool of talented individuals as a result the xinhua finance library foundation has identified the need to foster learning among local residents in impoverished regions and has acted by providing them access to books and other resources in this fashion local residents are now able to further enrich their knowledge and help develop their home region in the future we will continue to provide our support to such charitable endeavors
7453327 we may be through with the past but the past isnt through with us
7453328 the diary isnt orwell at his most polemic it is orwell at his most steady most observant
7453329 hes partly obsessed by the newspapers because of the start of the world war
7453330 the diary is written against this almost traumatized understanding that there is going to have to be a second world war
7453331 i thought if you publish what he wrote as he wrote it in real time people would find that rather engaging
7453332 no one knows the outcome whether he lives or dies from letter to letter
7453333 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7453334 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7453335 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7453336 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7453337 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7453338 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7453339 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7453340 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7453341 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news

7453348 we have completed investigations officials will soon be summoned to court
7453349 it is true that our institution is among those singled out in auditor generals report of having misused public funds and i am ready to answer what i know but as a new director of the institution it happened before my appointment
7453350 those involved are still our staff one of them was once held in police custody but later released on bail
7453351 but we have since 2007 instituted an internal special committee that is in charge of controls of tracking fuel
7453352 it is clear that junk foods and drinks gradually have replaced nutritious beverages and foods for many of our children
7453353 dentists have a saying snack and sip all day risk decay constantly bathing the teeth in sweetened beverages and unhealthy snacks is like providing an all you can eat buffet for the bacteria in your mouth the bacteria that cause tooth decay
7453354 lets see if you can do it in one take
7453355 i could understand if someone was a councillor and an mla who was attempting to become a minister if it was offered
7453356 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7453357 it is their usual grandstanding it seems to be the only course sinn fein knows they will have to learn that this course of action will not produce results
7453358 we will only move on policing and justice when the time is right
7453359 i would suggest that it would be more befitting for o caolain to keep his focus on sinn feins affairs in the south and leave issues pertaining to northern ireland to those who are elected here to deal with them
7453360 whilst the dup has made it clear to the sinn fein leadership that we are committed to working through outstanding issues and bringing them to a resolution such language as has been used by this sinn fein representative begins to cast significant doubt on sinn feins commitment to making progress in stormont
7453361 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7453362 tourists especially americans who came to see where the film was shot were always disappointed when they heard the pub didnt actually exist in real life
7453363 now they will be able to have a drink just like john wayne did in the film or browse the souvenirs
7453364 players go through physical fitness issues good or bad and in this case its psychological and weve just go to deal with it
7453365 roy keane is a great manager and has been a great footballer with a lot of experience so thats an interesting point of view yes a very interesting point of view
7453366 could not be explained by other factors such as birth weight the age of the mother order of birth gestational diabetes and whether the baby was breast fed or not
7453367 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7453368 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk would welcome more research in this area
7453369 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7453370 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7453371 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7453372 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7453373 i am scheduled to stay in the hospital for a few days after my operation which should be around four or five hours
7453374 i am due to go home two or three weeks after my operation i look forward to be going back to school to meet my friends
7453375 we had a mini tornado in the suburbs of new york on friday we never witnessed it in our lives it was a bit scary tree branches were broken off some places even got bad flooding
7453376 we raised around 1m all of it in ireland and most of it in the north west
7453377 i would pay tribute to everyone who contributed they say irish people are the most generous in the world and this proves it
7453378 when i saw the scars after the operation last october i was speechless
7453379 he looked like hed been bitten by a shark hes got an inner strength that id never seen before he meets the surgery and the pain head on hes an inspiration and will inspire people all over the world after this
7453380 the next surgery will be four to five hours which will mean around 60 hours of surgery in a year but hes ready for it he firmly believes that this is his moment and its a moment hes waited for all his life
7453381 tissues were taken from his leg this time last year to fill out his lower mouth and make it bigger then they implanted a steel plate in the lower end of his mouth that was for the jaw and to accommodate dental implants they have made for him
7453382 well we had hoped that if we had a national stadium then we might have hosted some of the events but i have to say that as time is marching on it looks increasingly unlikely which is really sad things like this only come along once in a generation maybe every two generations
7453383 its a marvellous opportunity for the uk and its a marvellous opportunity for northern ireland to be part of and i do hope we do get that opportunity
7453384 jeffrey donaldsons comments could be taken more seriously if his party were not blocking the multi sports stadium and with it a massive capital investment which is much needed in the current economic climate
7453385 edwin poots gregory campbell nigel dodds and peter robinson have messed around with this issue and have yet to even bring a paper on the long kesh site to the executive
7453386 this is a momentous day for sport as london celebrates becoming the official olympic games host city following great britains overwhelming medal success in beijing

7453389 over five million americans now suffer from atrial fibrillation where the heart goes out of control with little warning and for no apparent reason
7453390 its a frightening occurrence that will impact millions more as atrial fibrillation overtakes aging baby boomers the mayo clinic estimates that by 2050 at least 16 million americans will have it
7453391 the goal of stopafib org is to be one of the most trusted communities for atrial fibrillation patients
7453392 stopafib org is the 1 arrhythmia site on the internet and in the top 20 heart disease sites

7453397 i recommend fraxel re store treatment for anyone who wants more vibrant younger looking skin
7453398 before my fraxel re store treatment my face was covered in brown spots and age lines now the brown spots are gone wrinkles are reduced and my skin is tighter and feels much smoother

7453402 i will be reviewing the future of the coaches and the team manager if their objectives are in line with what we intend to do and they can still contribute we will welcome them
7453403 i have a new team and will have a new ceo and technical director it is best that the manager is chosen by them antony is welcome to apply for the position when we ask for applications
7453404 im not sacking anybody his contract expires on aug 31 and before the beijing olympics ssc had discussed facilitating his return and i said i had no objection it has nothing to do with the gao ning incident
7453405 i didnt say that antony and the coach will be sacked
7453406 i feel that its all been blown out of proportion and now the damage is really terrible
7453407 i dont want to be entangled in this whole issue we have to move on to the bigger picture that stta is working towards

7453410 i suppose that russia started thinking about the military intervention in georgia sometime in 2007
7453411 in july 2007 russia about pulling out from the conventional forces in europe treaty limiting military forces in europe and in caucasus
7453412 we had only 200 tanks because we had no right to have more according to the treaty russia brushed off its commitments by withdrawing from the treaty
7453413 britain saved my parents life they were real anglophiles im an american but i have a phenomenal love for this country im always looking for work here not because i need a job but because im looking for an excuse to come here ill always be grateful churchill is a human god and i wouldnt be here talking to you if it wasnt for him

7453415 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7453416 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7453417 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7453418 ive never been one to reflect and ive always sort of looked forward but i guess its time to reflect now

7453425 as long as congress is sitting and not doing the peoples bidding then were going to be here
7453426 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines
7453427 from that its probably not too big a leap to think its probably at least somewhat true across the board
7453428 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change

7453432 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen makes this particularly rare
7453433 the russian gangs who specialize in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave

7453448 this increase corresponds not only with increasing amounts of soil organic matter accumulating in organic plots but also with reduced manure application rates once soils in the organic systems had reached equilibrium levels of organic matter
7453449 this depends on the relevance of the differences to the human body tomato ketchup has higher levels of lycopene a strong antioxidant than either organic or conventional tomatoes so if you wanted lots of lycopene you should eat tomato ketchup
7453450 organic farming represents a sustainable method of agriculture that avoids the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides and makes use of crop rotation and good animal husbandry to control pests and diseases
7453451 from a nutritional perspective there is currently not enough evidence to recommend organic foods over conventionally produced foods

7453453 africa loses an estimated 4 billion of soil nutrients yearly severely eroding its ability to feed itself
7453454 writes dr elaine ingham founder of the pioneering measuring and certifying company soil foodweb inc
7453455 why todays conventional agricultural systems require such massive inputs of pesticides and fertilizers when a healthy soil is first plowed out of native grassland for example the disease suppressive bacteria and fungi protozoa and nematodes are present for the first 5 to 15 years after plowing native grassland you dont have to use any pesticides no fertilizers are required because there is natural nutrient cycling natural nitrogen retention and disease suppression as you plow that soil you start to kill the beneficial organisms you lose the organic matter and you lose the food to feed the beneficial organisms after about 10 to 15 years if youre not adding back adequate plant residue to feed those organisms you lose them and start having significant disease problems then you either leave that land and farm elsewhere or in the us we used fertilizers to keep yields high as more and more of the organisms were killed by the salt effect of the fertilizers and the constant plowing mined out more and more of the organic matter starving the beneficial organisms to death disease became a serious problem and we started using more and more pesticide to knock the disease back
7453456 there are some patches that are not so much waterlogged but they are false so from a health and safety point of view we had no choice

7453461 it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but
7453462 do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the same measure you use it will be measured to you
7453463 but now a righteousness from god apart from the law has been made known to which the law and the prophets testify this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified freely by his grace through the redemtion that came by christ jesus

7453472 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7453473 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7453474 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7453475 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7453476 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7453477 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7453478 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7453479 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7453483 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7453484 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7453485 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7453486 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7453487 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7453491 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7453492 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7453493 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7453494 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7453496 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7453497 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7453498 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7453499 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7453502 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7453505 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7453506 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7453507 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7453508 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7453509 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7453510 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7453511 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7453512 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7453513 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7453514 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7453515 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7453516 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7453517 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7453518 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7453519 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7453520 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7453521 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7453522 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7453523 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7453524 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7453525 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7453578 when someone is not interested in you they will typically point their body and feet away from you and position themselves at a greater distance
7453579 if you give your date a hug on the doorstep and he or she pats you on the back its a sign of discomfort
7453580 the more uncomfortable your date feels the bigger the pat the other obvious not so great sign is going in for the doorstep kiss and getting a handshake instead
7453581 flirting is how we communicate our interest and how we connect emotionally before we connect physically
7453582 generally flirting is harmless but it can sometimes be interpreted incorrectly by the flirtee the key is to pay attention to the tone of the flirtation and wait to see how the flirter responds if you try to take it up a notch if she backs down she was probably just flirting for fun if she escalates the flirting in turn shes communicating interest
7453583 use attitude voice and body synchronization to make others feel like they have a special rapport with you
7453584 how to make someone love you forever in 90 minutes or less
7453585 access and rev up your sex appeal without going over the top
7453586 when you synchronize your overall body language your tone the speed and volume of your voice and even the type of words you use as well as your attitude people feel safe familiar and trusting with you
7453587 and typically men love it and gravitate toward the woman who looks the most fun it certainly pays to familiarize yourself with all of the signs of attraction so you know how and when to communicate interest and make sure youre sending the right message
7453588 reading a book became a fun pastime something you could discuss with your friends and not be afraid of being uncool
7453589 after machiavelli hangman machiavellis doctrine books have been selling like mad and theres a surprising amount of searches on the internet engines like yahoo and google
7453590 even though this is so low budget i feel completely buzzed out from all the talk i didnt feel like this eager when i went to see revenge of the sith and im one of the biggest star wars fans there is
7453591 this is a travesty of our values like the da vinci code theyre lying to the public and passing it off as truth
7453592 its definitely something when you go in and you sit in that dark room not really knowing what to expect and then youre hit by surprise after surprise you dont see it coming and you cant blink because youre so afraid youd lose some vital information on the screen
7453593 this is our response to the mortar shelling by government forces in the area
7453594 the biggest thing is not to look cool but to have a life with lots of interests
7453595 because bulgaria s in the european community you have full rights in this country you can live here legally take advantage of the free nhs everything and no one can stop you from traveling
7453596 yet the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7453597 we recognise it is of course highly offensive to a lot of people
7453598 the mayor is deeply disturbed and has made it clear that the film should not be shown in london house again
7453599 recent acts of terrorism in kabul against the indian embassy there and in indian cities have led to a new trade of accusations islamabad has denied involvement skirmishes along the loc line of control in kashmir have added to mounting tensions
7453600 the challenge for the new coalition government is to see if it can repair the immediate damage and move towards constructing a stronger relationship with india
7453601 establishing itself as a stable cohesive force at home would be a vital step in this task
7453602 only a government that is firmly in control of its own helm can hope to enter into talks with a potentially hostile neighbour with any degree of success
7453603 some of his actions seem to have been largely cosmetic even where his own will to move forward was strong he was thwarted by others adopting a more hawkish line
7453604 the conviction that jihad in kashmir needs backing remains strongly rooted in some quarters
7453605 needs to challenge this mindset and persuade people that evolving a new relationship of trust and cooperation with india is vital in the longer run to the safety and welfare of the people of the region no matter which country or territory they live in
7453606 worked actively to build closer ties with pakistans giant neighbour to the east
7453607 his visit to agra in the summer of 2001 had helped relations move many paces forward even a breakthrough on kashmir looked possible at one stage and there was early hope of a complete turnaround in relations between the neighbours who had fought two wars since independence
7453608 the fact that musharraf who had participated in hostilities was willing to abandon the traditional military view on india was seen as significant
7453609 the early hope of agra faded the fact that musharraf was not an elected leader hindered talks but despite this with some help from his friends in the white house and elsewhere musharraf was also able to help dissipate the alarming tensions that emerged following the december 2001 terrorist attack on the indian parliament
7453610 the indians had long argued that jihadi outfits in the disputed territory were backed by pakistans establishment at least on paper the activities of militant militias were largely halted
7453611 the period of relative calm in kashmir made it possible for people to move back to border villages for divided families to meet and for movement across the border to take place similar confidence building measures slightly eased travel between pakistan and india tensions were lowered and over the last year selected indian films have played in pakistan
7453612 seems to have been a success but there have been alarming indications that much of what has happened since 2001 is cosmetic
7453613 reports since 2005 say the jihadi outfits are still being retained and covertly supported indeed some of these groups surfaced quite openly in the aftermath of the october 2005 earthquake their relief efforts suggesting they remained well organised and well equipped armies of militants
7453614 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7453615 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7453616 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7453617 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7453618 all 10 have been deported they were deported sunday evening in beijing before the end of the closing ceremony
7453619 we did have a sense from the little information we have that there was some mistreatment
7453620 it is undeniable that indonesias aviation industry is in a bad condition
7453621 a lack of discipline lax licensing restrictions sloppy management and enforcement of rules poor education and training within the industry unauthorized tariffs and the non existence of a
7453622 from the beginning it was explicitly stated the ban by the eu was technical in nature
7453623 and every day european aircraft pass through indonesian airspace managed by the indonesian aviation authority to reach australia and new zealand didnt you say that the indonesian aviation authority does not meet europes safety standards
7453624 coastal erosion is threatening thousands of sites around scotland and the local group here came up with a novel idea for dealing with the problem
7453625 seeing the stones from the original building being transported away in a fleet of tractors was a fantastic sight
7453626 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines
7453627 from that its probably not too big a leap to think its probably at least somewhat true across the board
7453628 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change
7453629 to me its a plan that says theyre going to do more planning
7453630 my study plots in california at least indicate theyve continued to plummet and very seriously so
7453631 the son of a single mother working his way up and then going back to work in communities that were felled by steel plant closings we are going to tell that story
7453632 but we are also going to tell the story about what has happened to the country under the policies we have seen under the broken politics of washington we are not going to shy away from making a contrast
7453633 at this defining moment in our history with our nation at war our economy in recession we know that the american people can not afford four more years of the same failed policies and the same old politics in washington
7453634 he needs to demonstrate that he is a person of strength that the line that he is inexperienced is not applicable to him and he needs to tie his opponent to the current administration
7453635 i think obama will still have a difficult time with some of the clinton supporters
7453636 i do not think it will be easy even with hillary supporting obama i think it will be a difficult time for some of her supporters they may never come around and if they do it still may be late in the campaign before they do
7453637 he is that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids iowa and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw veterans hall in concord new hampshire and at the center of an international crisis
7453638 he also has the courage the courage to make this a better place
7453639 and let me tell you something else this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7453640 he has to establish that he is a plausible commander in chief
7453641 many voters think he is but some have their doubts or simply dont know very much about him in that regard
7453642 it shows that barack obama is someone who is prepared to bring into his administration talented people from all walks of life who are able to help him move forward
7453643 but it will be clear that he is the president
7453644 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth the truth hurt and obama didnt like it
7453645 i think if you talk to people in denver this week you are not going to see a lot of a funk disappointment
7453646 what you are going to see are a lot of people who know that we cant have four more years of these policies
7453647 wilt u hier het keukenblok of heeft u liever daar een toiletruimte extra raam of kast
7453648 what was that and why havent you forwarded it to me yet
7453649 environmental bullshit among the chattering classes that has allowed gordon brown to double air passenger duty
7453650 we need a recession if we are going to see off some of this environmental nonsense
7453651 you paid nothing for your ticket so you get nothing thats the company philosophy you paid nothing we take you there but hey you paid nothing so if we dont take you there tough youve only lost five euros
7453652 voor het eerst in de clubgeschiedenis geven we meer dan zes miljoen euro transfergeld uit aan vier nieuwe spelers en dan starten we maar met n op zes
7453653 dat de nieuwkomers zich nog moeten aanpassen vind ik een flauw excuus
7453654 ik heb vooral een probleem met een gebrek aan mentaliteit
7453655 ik zag een veel scherper bergen dat veel meer gezonde agressiviteit toonde
7453656 het is aan de spelers om hun conclusies te trekken
7453657 of ik vind dat er een ploeg op het veld staat
7453658 we kregen van de week veel kritiek maar dit is ons antwoord
7453659 mijn spelers hebben het schitterend gedaan ik zag veel vechtlust en snel voetbal
7453660 vincent heeft heel goed gespeeld hij heeft aan iedereen laten zien wat ik al wist dat hij een uitzonderlijk getalenteerde jongeman is en op verschillende posities kan spelen
7453661 het is altijd een gok om iemand na n training in het team te droppen
7453662 maar hij heeft aan iedereen laten zien wat ik al wist dat hij een uitzonderlijk getalenteerde jongeman is en op verschillende posities kan spelen
7453663 ik heb er 100 procent van genoten veel duels veel energie
7453664 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
7453665 maar er zijn wel meerkosten en alles wat energie betreft is extra duur geworden
7453666 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
7453667 at a time when a sluggish national economy and rising consumer prices are straining household finances it is a pleasure to let the public know that some forgotten or lost items are waiting to be reunited with rightful owners
7453668 complacency is enemy number one when it comes to preparing for another influenza pandemic
7453669 these stories told so eloquently by survivors family members and friends from past pandemics serve as a sobering reminder of the devastating impact that influenza can have and reading them is a must for anyone involved in public health preparedness
7453670 its an excellent resource not only for public health professionals but for people of all ages
7453671 its probably the closest to experiencing the real thing that many of us can imagine

7453715 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent

7453717 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7453718 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7453719 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7453720 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7453721 you spend half the morning getting briefed on every possible issue that might come up in your portfolio and then not get asked a single question

7453725 in the week before his passing yadav had been carefully completing homework involving the study of sea creatures and water and rainfall
7453726 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7453727 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7453728 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families

7453731 the downward trend now is firmly in place and we will go through those supports
7453732 with an rba rate cut cycle imminent that should continue to weigh on the australian dollar as well as the stronger us dollar and weaker commodity price trends
7453733 were not expecting the us dollar to continue to appreciate at the pace weve seen in the past month but were looking for it to strengthen over the medium term
7453734 its a great result for all the players just to find out whether were going or not going
7453735 i think all the guys are happy now we know now that the icc cricket australia and aca australian cricketers association would make a decision and theyve finally done that
7453736 its a tournament title australian currently holds and next year whenever they put it on well look forward to retaining that trophy
7453737 right now all the guys are rapt the icc has made a decision
7453738 the result was far more important than the performance today
7453739 wigan have a very good squad good organisation and are very athletic but my players fought hard and you must come to places like wigan and win if you want to be involved in the title race

7453744 good for her on getting to number one but the song is painful to listen to
7453745 katy says the music business needs more females with opinions but she falls on her own argument because she has been constructed by guys i dont think its real
7453746 i will still probably cover that song one day for fun i covered gabriella cilmis sweet about me and i dont agree with those lyrics either

7453760 you spend half the morning getting briefed on every possible issue that might come up in your portfolio and then not get asked a single question
7453761 sometimes these doubts are cast but i would suggest some americans could look at themselves first they had cheats in 2000 marion jones and cheats in 2004 so they think no one wins without cheating
7453762 why is the emphasis on that fellow and not for example on eight gold medal winner michael phelps both those guys are just freakish athletes
7453763 i went down there to open it in 2005 but since then there hasnt been the political will to fund it
7453764 its not specifically america what youve seen is the fight against doping has resulted in a lot of athletes who might not have previously got on the podium now getting there
7453765 relatively clean countries like great britain and australia are now coming through

7453774 i dont see any storm clouds on the horizon i see clear skies for our convention
7453775 although it was part of our original vision when i started working at mtv 10 years ago i didnt think we could achieve so early in our history i am particularly happy to see it happen in my country finally we are going to be able to demonstrate our commitment to develop the quality of african artistes and music in a rewarding way
7453776 we recognise it is of course highly offensive to a lot of people
7453777 the mayor is deeply disturbed and has made it clear that the film should not be shown in london house again
7453778 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7453779 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7453780 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7453781 mahamm wanneer kom je nou die loempia in elkaar zetten
7453782 flo je mag me niet slaan want wat gij niet wilt dat u geschied doe dat ook een ander niet duss
7453783 wat wil je meenemen ik versta het echt niet weet je wat ga het maar halen dan
7453784 nou gewoon kabouters hebben baarden en dwergen n na een blik op de puzzel ehm ook maar dwergen wonen in een huis en niet in een paddenstoel
7453785 mam als een ridder met harnas vroeger moest plassen hoe deed hij dat dan
7453786 i just got a call from chika our energy editor who used to be a crime reporter she said a police officer called to inform her that a thisday staff driving a kia was shot last night at dopemu area and he died the officer said it was a case of assassination since nothing was taken from the car
7453787 no not again not again another colleague of mine not again
7453788 i just spoke with a reporter with a national newspaper who said she was around that area last night she said when they heard gun shots they all ran away but on instinct she went to the scene a few minutes later and saw policemen chasing people away they tried to chase her away but she identified herself as a journalist so one policeman told her if you have a camera come and take the picture now o before una go write say na police kill am so it was not a matter of driving against one way
7453789 one police officer in plain clothes was inspecting the jeep suv and i drew near to him and greeted him
7453790 and so what because you are a journalist we wont ask for your particulars
7453791 what appears to happen is that decisions are very often taken on what effectively is a system of trade off of demands between the political parties as opposed to focusing on the real merits in particular issues
7453792 in our ibadan convention in 1997 we withdrew our activities in all the schools even though today we still have organizations who use this name in schools the name people are answering today black axe is not the name of the organisation it is just a name people use because of their criminal activities
7453793 we are working hard towards liaising with other pan africanist movements all over the world to be able to put resources together to be able to sort out some of the problems militating against the black people all over the world we have our mouthpiece through which we educate the teeming populace on what the blackman should be so that at no point in time should any blackman see himself as a second class citizen or an inferior race anywhere in the world
7453794 yes they lost a lot of athletes but they always have great athletes coming in
7453795 they have a great tradition in the system its out go the old and in come the new there isnt a lot of drop off in athleticism and talent experience yes but not talent
7453796 theyre unsettled in the quarterback and their strength is the running back
7453797 they have a couple of nice tight ends theyll probably use the key is to be ready to adjust
7453798 weve seen a ton of different looks that our defense gives us
7453799 they do so many different things different coverages rotations and blitzes weve seen a lot of good defensive football in camp
7453800 micro credit is all about helping people get out of poverty
7453801 poverty is not created by the poor people it is created by the system
7453802 we can create a world where nobody would be poor and that day we can create a poverty museum
7453803 we need to open a new kind of business a social business doing it not to make money but to impact on other peoples lives
7453804 we are doing this in bangladesh and it is working
7453805 human being is not a money making machine but a multi dimensional being
7453806 all the good things that are happening in bangladesh and grameen today are simply because of the decisions we took in the beginning
7453807 the grameen bank that you hear about today is not only for the poor but owned by the poor women of bangladesh
7453808 we lend over a billion dollars a year and it is the decision of the poor women who sit on the board of the bank
7453809 money that goes into the family through women creates more value in that family than the one that came in through men
7453810 we have not brought professor yunus here for the camaraderie but we have brought him here in order to learn from him
7453811 one more proof of visafones commitment to excellent quality of service and fulfilment of its brand promise of spreading the joy of communication

7453814 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7453815 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7453816 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7453817 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7453818 an indictment on their competence to impact positively on these students and groom them to become leaders of tomorrow
7453819 we are shocked at this reckless administrative action by the university the students were never invited to appear before any panel to at least state their own side of the story before this very painful decision was taken
7453820 worse still is the reason for the said suspension according to the various letters of suspension dated 20th august 2008 signed by the registrar of the university copy attached to this press release the students were suspended indefinitely because of their alleged involvement in a protest march to lagos state television ltv 8 on friday 15th august 2008 to air their views on the increase of school fees
7453821 the right to express ones opinion is a right that enjoys constitutional backing perhaps the university authority is lacking in professional minds to appreciate the importance inviolability and supremacy of the nigerian constitution

7453823 im very disappointed that we did not win the boys played well and had their chances but in football if you dont score you dont win and this is what happened today we had ours we didnt take them they argentina had one and they took it and won the match
7453824 but that is football im still very proud with the overall performance of the boys to get to the final of the olympics is no easy achievement were happy that weve been able to win a silver medal after all every team that came here beijing came here for the same purpose but in the end only two teams can have that honour
7453825 the players couldnt play at their best because of the heat it was unfair on them and unfair on the fans because they couldnt watch the kind of football they had expected from the two sides that know how to score goals but we didnt make the rules though
7453826 of course we feared the heat it was the major reason for the way we approached the game i wasnt the organiser so i dont really want to comment on it but it was a major reason why the final was not spectacular
7453827 we should build on the foundation we are laying with these boys
7453828 the failure of our boys to take the gold medal is bad for me
7453829 many people were ready to roll out the drums on the streets of aba today saturday if we had won the gold and this would have meant big business for many people including myself
7453830 president umaru yaradua should reward the boys adequately for doing the nation proud they deserve to be given national award
7453831 in spite of the defeat the team played well and showed they were good soccer ambassadors of nigeria and africa at the beijing games

7453913 some families from the name of a place in sindh arrived at the name of a place in karachi and were taken upon by the name of one linguistic group who misbehaved with their women
7453914 their bodies were painted red and they were stripped naked one linguistic group has given the name of another group a deadline to leave an area in karachi think are you going to do something or just talk send this sms to all one linguistic group so that the nation awakens long live the name of a political leader

7453916 the reports say talibinisation as nothing else but propaganda against the pakhtoon and does not in any way refer to the recent arrival of pakhtoon in karachi
7453917 either the taliban or the security forces have driven out thousands of displaced pakhtoon families who have been arriving in karachi for the past couple of months they do not pose any threat to the city in the near future and these reports have only been compiled on the instructions of the higher ups

7453922 beliau menghimbau agar jangan menyerah dan agar para pemimpin mendorong kembalinya resumption of negotiation agar perundingan dapat dimulai kembali presiden mengharapkan ini dapat dilakukan bulan september
7453923 presiden menyatakan bahwa kita harus berupaya sekuat mungkin agar kompromi dapat dicapai jadi memang harus ada upaya untuk menjembatani posisi posisi yang masih berbeda
7453924 ini untuk mengupayakan agar perundingan dapat dimulai kembali umumnya mereka sepakat tidak bisa putaran doha gagal harus sukses karena kepentingan negara berkembang
7453925 untuk mencapai konsensus harus ada kemauan politik yang kuat untuk mencapai kompromi
7453926 as ada pemilu dan lebih baik doha roound di capai sebelum political cycle di as itu menjadi beku sekarang ini masih ada window opportunity masih sedikit dan presiden percaya kita harus memantapkan window of opportunity itu sebaik mungkin

7453929 micah was a little bit groggy obviously but the paramedics did their job
7453930 there are always concerns when you see incidents like this they stabilised him and got him off the pitch
7453931 they did all the correct things and by all accounts he was lucid in the tunnel
7453932 i do not think there is any concern regarding a neck injury it is more he has a bang on his head
7453933 i knew he was a good player and you saw that as well
7453934 you always hope that when you introduce someone who hasnt plied their trade in the premier league they will make an instant impact
7453935 vincent has presence an understanding of the game and he recognises danger when those situations occur he nips these things in the bud
7453936 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7453937 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7453938 without doubt its not a comfortable situation either for him or for us

7453941 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7453942 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7453943 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7453944 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7453945 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7453946 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7453947 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7453948 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7453949 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7453950 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7453951 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7453952 voetballen is heel simpel maar het moeilijkste wat er is is simpel voetballen
7453953 je moet altijd zorgen dat je een doelpunt meer scoort als de tegenstander
7453954 het behoort tot de wetten van het voetbal dat op succes vaak een grote teleurstelling volgt
7453955 spelers worden be nvloed mensen worden be nvloed spelers worden weer door mensen be nvloed
7453956 er zijn in een wedstrijd drie minuten en die natuurlijk onderverdeeld in momenten waar het op aankomt
7453957 het is natuurlijk een gegeven dat wanneer de achterste van de vier niet goed in de balcirculatie je op het middenveld juist een mannetje meer maar dan moet je je niet laten zakken terwijl je elftal in twee delen op de helft van de tegenpartij
7453958 ik heb wel eens gezegd als je met 4 0 voor staat en er zijn nog tien minuten te spelen kun je beter twee ballen op de lat schieten zodat de mensen oei en ai roepen want als je 5 0 maakt is dat alleen maar voor de stand
7453959 er is maar n moment dat je op tijd kunt komen ben je er niet dan ben je f te vroeg f te laat
7453960 het moeilijke van een makkelijke wedstrijd is om een zwakke tegenstander slecht te laten voetballen
7453961 als je een goal maakt ja dan zit hij er in
7453962 de zegen van al die gelijkmakers is hun stellige ondergang
7453963 als je sneller wilt spelen kun je wel harder lopen maar in wezen bepaalt de bal de snelheid van het spel
7453964 in voetbal is het simpel je bent op tijd of je bent te laat als je te laat bent moet je zorgen dat je op tijd vertrekt
7453965 voetbal is een spel van fouten wie de minste fouten maakt wint
7453966 de basis is de bal zo snel mogelijk onder controle krijgen zodat je iets meer tijd hebt om te kijken
7453967 je gaat het pas zien als je het door hebt
7453968 voor een slechte voetballer heeft hij een hele goede techniek maar voor een goede voetballer heeft hij juist een slechte techniek
7453969 voetbal hoort gespeeld te worden in een 4 3 3 opstelling je kunt niet met twee spitsen spelen want dan krijg je oneven getallen en kan een elftal nooit functioneren
7453970 tactiek is niet je man uitschakelen of zo nee het is weten waar je mee bezig bent
7453971 als ik een bal aan de voet heb die ik wil afspelen dan moet ik rekening houden met mijn bewaker de wind het gras de snelheid waarmee de spelers lopen wij berekenen de kracht waarmee je moet schoppen en de richting waarin in ntiende seconde een computer doet daar twee minuten over
7453972 wat is snelheid vaak verwisselt de sportpers snelheid met inzicht kijk als ik iets eerder begin te lopen dan een ander dan lijk ik sneller
7453973 om goed te voetballen heb je goede voetballers nodig maar een goede voetballer heeft bijna altijd het probleem van een gebrek aan rendement hij wil het altijd mooier doen dan strikt noodzakelijk
7453974 mensen zeggen ook dat een ploeg die met tien man speelt gevaarlijker is dan een ploeg met elf man hoe vaak heb je d t nou niet gehoord dat komt alleen maar omdat vijf van die elf denken ik doe een stapje minder terwijl vijf van die tien er juist een schepje bovenop doen
7453975 vier achter en vier op het middenveld kan nooit functioneren je driehoeken vallen weg je moet altijd driehoeken hebben want alleen dan heb je constant twee afspeelmogelijkheden
7453976 als mijn aanvaller n tegen n komt zeg ik altijd laat het hem lekker uitzoeken dan zeggen de spelers we kunnen hem toch helpen mijn antwoord is dan ten eerste is de kans groot dat je in de weg loopt en bovendien trek je als tweede aanvaller een tweede verdediger mee en twee tegen twee is moeilijker dan n tegen n
7453977 als je een hoge balcirculatie nodig hebt kan het niet zo zijn dat er een speler met de bal gaat lopen dat kan niet je kunt hooguit met een bal lopen om een ander de tijd te geven ergens te komen
7453978 wanneer je met twee spitsen speelt kan de keeper van de tegenpartij de bal negen van de tien keer bij een vleugelverdediger kwijt vervolgens moeten de vier middenvelders weer opschuiven dat gaat even goed maar in de loop van de wedstrijd worden er toch fouten gemaakt daarom speel ik altijd met drie spitsen omdat de veldbezetting dan beter is
7453979 je moet een gat voor je laten vallen en er dan zelf inlopen
7453980 als je op balbezit speelt hoef je niet te verdedigen want er is maar n bal
7453981 wat heb je nou liever n goed 11 tal of 11 goede 1 tallen
7453982 er was spektakel zat maar qua teamspel was het een complete chaos
7453983 kluivert die trapt nog geen deuk in een pakje boter
7453984 je bent net zoveel waard als de tijd die je op tv komt
7453985 de tijd dat ik zelf geld meenam is al heel lang geleden ik neem altijd de naam en het gezicht mee
7453986 ik laat me betalen voor mijn naam en faam het liefst door onnozelen
7453987 als je dan zegt dat het stadion eigenlijk het johan cruijff stadion had moeten heten dan geef ik je gelijk als je commercieel denkt dan had het stadion naar mij vernoemd moeten worden ze denken hier commercieel maar toch hebben ze dat niet gedaan dat is raar
7453988 als je ergens niet bent ben je f te vroeg f te laat
7453989 ik neem altijd z lf de beslissingen dus als ze bij ajax tegen me zeggen je bent te oud dan zeg ik dat beslis jij niet dat beslis ik
7453990 de hoogste opgave van het menselijk kennen is te begrijpen dat hij niet begrijpen kan
7453991 er is nu eenheid iedereen doet in principe wat ik vraag het zijn namelijk geen hollanders die als je begint met ademhalen al zeggen ja maar
7453992 ik spreek beter spaans dan welke nederlander dan ook maar slechter spaans dan welke spanjaard dan ook
7453993 e n van de 32 landen die deelnemen aan het wk wordt wereldkampioen de anderen niet want die zijn er niet
7453994 wij hebben het uitstekend gedaan simpelweg omdat we niet beter konden
7453995 ze hadden een moeilijke poule dat wil zeggen dat de tegenstanders sterk zijn
7453996 het is heerlijk om te horen dat je de beste bent wat betreft mijn mindere kwaliteiten daar zoek ik altijd de beste rugdekking voor zeg maar adviseurs ik ga ook niet in het doel staan als ik goed ben v r
7453997 ik ben er nog steeds van overtuigd dat zoals ik het doe je het moet doen want anders zou ik het niet doen
7453998 voordat ik een fout maak maak ik die fout niet
7453999 ik maak eigenlijk nooit fouten want ik heb enorme moeite om me te vergissen
7454000 ik hou van werken zolang het werken is waarvan ik hou
7454001 je kunt beter ten onder gaan met je eigen visie dan met de visie van een ander
7454002 geen trainer heeft de wijsheid in pacht ik ook niet
7454003 ik ben overal tegen tot ik een besluit neem dan ben ik ervoor
7454004 de waarheid is nooit precies zoals je denkt dat hij zou zijn
7454005 ik ben er niet zomaar op mijn zeventiende als uit de lucht gevallen ingekomen ik was er al vanaf mijn veertiende ik pikte toen al de brommers van de jongens uit het eerste elftal ik keek niet tegen hen op ik wist gewoon dat ik er bij moest horen vroeg of laat
7454006 uitersten daar hou ik niet van elk uiterste is iets waanzinnigs
7454007 het leven is een stroom zeggen de mensen dat klopt toen ik laatst tegen de wind in wou spuwen spoog ik mezelf in het gezicht
7454008 als ik thuiskom van een televisie analyse vraagt mijn vrouw wat heb je gezegd dan zeg ik al sla je me dood
7454009 als het niet goed gaat dan gaat het niet goed
7454010 volgens mij komt in mijn werkwijze de kern van het spel tot uiting
7454011 als je voor elke positie de beste speler kiest heb je nog geen sterk elftal maar een team dat als los zand uiteen valt
7454012 het is noodzakelijk dat iedereen er is om het meeste uit zichzelf te halen wat dat dan ook mag zijn
7454013 mensen die niet van niveau zijn kunnen mijn integriteit niet aantasten
7454014 al maanden hoor je de regering over het bevorderen van de integratie zijn we daar via de sport op een heel breed front mee bezig gaat diezelfde overheid weer dwarsliggen dus schenkingsrecht betalen terwijl je bezig bent hun probleem op te lossen ik vraag me af of onze overheid inderdaad niet in staat is om verder dan de eigen kantoren te denken
7454015 ik geloof niet in spanje slaan alle 22 spelers een kruisje voordat ze het veld opkomen als het werkt zal het dus altijd een gelijkspel worden
7454016 bij barcelona hadden we een kapel in de catacomben voor iedere wedstrijd gingen beide elftallen daar bidden daar zag ik het nut niet van in er gingen twee elftallen bidden maar er kan er slechts n winnen nee met het voetbal heeft het niets te maken
7454017 ik geloof niet omdat ik dus niet gelovig ben maar ik denk wel dat er iets anders is maar daardoor geloof ik datgene wat ik dus denk dat er is
7454018 als ik zou willen dat je het begreep had ik het wel beter uitgelegd
7454019 italianen kunnen niet van je winnen maar je kunt wel van ze verliezen
7454020 bij as roma zal ik nooit kunnen werken daar ligt een sintelbaan rond het veld dat is het ergste wat er is
7454021 je ziet nooit een hollander die uitblinkt in krachtsporten het zit kennelijk niet in onze mentaliteit om te gaan gewichtheffen dat kunnen we niet opbrengen je ziet wel dat we alle zee n bevaren hebben en in hockey volleybal en voetbal staan we bovenaan dus waar ligt het gaatje en hoe kom je er iets slimmer zijn dan een ander hollanders hebben een streepje voor
7454022 het nederlandse voetbal is veel leuker dan het italiaanse waar wacht je op op n schot per wedstrijd of n actie je wilt van ronaldo toch twintig acties zien in plaats van drie
7454023 arrogantie is alleen gepast als je uitblinkt op de rest in weze blinkt hij niet uit en is zijn arrogantie dus niet gepast
7454024 ik vind dat je nu wel een beetje zielig zit te doen

7454026 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7454027 if aybars got the ball theres no obstruction you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7454028 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays
7454029 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you
7454030 in the meantime its something i cant control weve got a long way to go and im still looking forward to getting some more opportunities

7454032 i was planning on swinging at that fastball but i saw rickie take off so i figured id take it let him get to second scoring position
7454033 split finger i think he hung it a little bit and it found a hole for me
7454034 you just had the feeling getting out of that jam right there we were going to win the ball game in the bottom half of the inning
7454035 i think definitely you have to give a lot of credit to catcher geovany soto weve been working pretty well together im comfortable with him behind the plate i think a lot of it is mixing up pitches keeping them guessing
7454036 the active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive
7454037 prefer the specific to the general the definite to the vague the concrete to the abstract
7454038 if those who have studied the art of writing life are in accord on any one point it is on this the surest way to get inspired and remain perseverant is by being specific definite and concrete
7454039 is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape

7454080 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
7454081 in the prince harry coverage for example there were all these people out there you never really saw them
7454082 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7454083 it probably did bring a lot of people to think about afghanistan who normally wouldnt ordinarily think about afghanistan if the prince harry story can bring more people to think about afghanistan then thats a good thing
7454084 there was a lost opportunity there was hardly any mention of afghans even of afghanistan just a sense of i went to a country far away
7454085 viewing figures went up prince harry got a heros welcome and recruitment for the british army went up so an objective was achieved did that mean people knew more about why britain was there i dont think so
7454086 and i am much handsomer my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom and it is a pleasure to look at us do you know of anything prettier than we are you old willow tree
7454087 stupid tree he is so old that grass grows out of his body
7454088 the angel of the storm is coming his wings spread from the sky above to the earth beneath he will strike you down before you can cry for mercy
7454089 do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts even men cannot do that in a flash of lightning heaven opens and we can look in but the sight will strike even human beings blind what then must happen to us who only grow out of the earth and are so inferior to them if we venture to do so
7454090 how the sun shines and the clouds float in the blue sky do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush wherefore do you weep old willow tree
7454091 i wish people would focus on the work rather than my weight i am just lucky naturally very thin and if they studied my art a bit more the films might get somewhere at the box office

7454094 als deze blankenjacht is georganiseerd door de politiek is dit regelrechte staatsterreur en zou meteen de slappe houding van die zelfde politiek verklaren
7454095 ook de politie op curacao speelde hierbij een zeer dubieuze rol volgens getuigen stonden ze erbij en keken ernaar

7454098 het gaf niet dat het verhaal al was begonnen want bij kathakali hadden ze al lang geleden ontdekt dat het geheim van de grote verhalen ligt in het feit dat ze geen geheimen hebben de grote verhalen zijn verhalen die je al kent en steeds opnieuw wilt horen waarbij je overal kunt binnenvallen waar je behaaglijk in kunt wonen ze bedriegen je niet met spanning en kunstige ontknopingen ze verrassen je niet met iets onverwachts ze zijn je vertrouwd als het huis waarin je woont of als de huisdeur van je geliefde je weet hoe ze aflopen en toch luister je alsof dat niet zo is net zoals je weet dat je ooit doodgaat maar leeft alsof dat niet zo is bij de grote verhalen weet je al wie er blijft leven wie er doodgaat wie er liefde vindt en wie niet en toch wil je het opnieuw weten dit is hun mysterie hun magie voor de kathakali man zijn deze verhalen zijn kinderen en zijn jeugd hij is erin opgegroeid ze zijn het huis waarin hij groot werd de velden waarin hij speelde ze zijn zijn ramen zijn manier van kijken dus als hij een verhaal vertelt behandelt hij het als zijn eigen kind hij plaagt het hij straft het hij gooit het als een bal omhoog hij worstelt ermee vloert het en laat het weer gaan hij lacht het uit omdat hij het liefheeft hij kan je in een paar minuten door hele werelden laten vliegen om dan uren stil te staan bij een verleppend blad of om met de staart van een slapelde aap te spelen hij kan moeiteloos van een gruwelijke oorlog overstappen op de gelukzaligheid van een vrouw die haar haar wast in een bergbeek van de geslepen uitbundigheid van een hindoeduivel met een plotselinge inval op een praatzieke malayali met de nieuwste roddel van de zinnelijkheid van een vrouw met een baby aan de borst op krishnas onweerstaanbaar schalkse lach hij kan het stukje verdriet blootleggen dat in blijdschap schuilt de verborgen vis van schande in een zee van roem

7454104 es ist ein licht angegangen aber ich wei nicht was es zu bedeuten hat
7454105 der kapit n sagte ein licht sei angegangen er wisse aber nicht was das zu bedeuten habe

7454111 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7454112 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7454113 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7454114 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7454115 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee

7454120 chris anderson is one of the best editors ive ever worked with and definitely the finest young editor ive had the privilege to know he has a solid grasp both of the big picture and the details is great to work with and cares a ton about the end product cant recommend him any higher
7454121 ive been with the company for 9 months now and ive worked with both chris and his predecessor ive also worked with dozens of editors and writers chris has been one of the most forceful dynamic and organized ive ever encountered not only has chris vastly improved the efficiency of the magazine but he has pushed me to be a better writer im confident that he will create new opportunities for this magazine as well as greatly improve its readership
7454122 i have never had the pleasure of meeting chris anderson face to face yet he has provided invaluable assistance to me in my aspiration to crack the market as a freelance writer he is a diligent and fastidious editor who truly cares about every writer who submits articles for publication whether on the payroll or in a freelance capacity chris would be a valuable addition to any staff my first contact with chris came through a facebook ad soliciting submissions when he was working for asian restaurant news he offered me my first chance to see my byline in print in the short time i have been able to work with him he has given me helpful advice in regards to writing for magazine publication and for editing my work prior to submission while i was a small part of the publication chris made me feel as though i was an integral contributor he took the time to help make me a better writer not only because it would assist his own magazine and his career he took this time because he understands the trials and tribulations of the aspiring writer and because he knows that loyalty begets loyalty in turn also well versed in new technologies chris successfully launched a web marketing campaign for the magazine as well as oversaw the creation and maintenance of the website he demonstrated real talent for leadership and has a natural ability to create passion within others i would highly recommend chris for employment he is a very talented individual motivated and dedicated plus technologically savvy a unique combination indeed
7454123 chris has a can do attitude and is fearless in tackling new challenges he is open minded and positive a pleasure to work with in any situation
7454124 chris tested software id written for a complicated embedded system he quickly learned about the systems features and operation tested it thoroughly and wrote thorough bug reports that contained all the necessary information in addition to being a skilled software qa engineer chris is also a pleasant co worker with a good sense of humor
7454125 chris was a productive and dedicated employee at leapfrog enterprises inc he made lots of friends throughout the office and was appreciated for his leadership qualities and creation of new processes chris takes his work seriously and is hardworking he was a pleasure to work with
7454126 chris anderson was by far the best public affairs intern weve ever had at cbia he was bright eager to please and a real asset to our team since moving on ive watched chris grow and progress in his craft and would have no problem recommending him to you for consideration
7454127 i heard some things that there were three or four gun shot wounds and that it was about an hour and a half until he was found
7454128 people said he clambered in to a garden and fell in to the garden
7454129 this was a young man of 24 with his life before him and i would like to send out an appeal for calm because this is another life that has been wasted
7454130 where individuals have friction between them we ask that they try to work that out work with the police work with other partners and other agencies to try and resolve the issues
7454131 when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7454132 we are very very worried were very concerned and questions have to be asked of the authorities
7454133 were calling on the police to take more action to ensure that the public are protected
7454134 a fascinating read for anyone with an interest in the amazing world where science meets crime
7454135 globalization has proceeded at a much slower pace in beer industry than other related business
7454136 the reason why british beer never has not been successful in the international level is because their owned brands were domestic in focus or scope while their international brands were licenced to foreign firms
7454137 if you want to know andys motivation for doing something just ask yourself what did andy get out of it

7454140 the kenyans were out to destroy the opposition and they got me first
7454141 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7454142 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7454143 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7454144 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7454145 but once we were award of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7454146 we felt given the new information we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7454147 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7454148 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7454149 this is a terrible tragedy to those people who have become ill and to the families who have lost loved ones i want to express my deepest and most sincere sympathies words cannot begin to express our sadness for your pain

7454224 in some remote corner of the universe poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge

7454227 i remember doing one of my first opening spots at the up the creek venue in london and seeing a really really slick stand up doing 20 minutes
7454228 i thought to myself i just could never do that i couldnt be ultra confident
7454229 but i wanted to be the opposite of that and just be disastrous
7454230 it was all of my leave for the year but comedy is an antidote to civvy street
7454231 working incredibly hard the previous year and didnt have much of a social life
7454232 i thought itd be 250 quid and a bit of a laugh but then i won the bbcs competition for new comedy talent
7454233 my first year was amazing and i thought id just carry on
7454234 quite how someone can be so hilarious without any actual jokes is sheer genius
7454235 if you look at the if com award nominees they were all slick and im the opposite of that
7454236 the judges were all senior critics from the fringe and to be given an award by them is astonishing really
7454237 it was a great thing i care about it an awful lot and i was very pleased to get it
7454238 ive worked on last years show all this year at the hen and chickens venue in london and now i have a final version
7454239 what ive been doing is almost down to the minute what i want from an hour long show
7454240 i think what ive achieved this year is to prove to myself that i can do a professional show and that makes a big difference

7454247 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7454248 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7454249 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7454250 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7454251 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7454252 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7454253 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7454254 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7454255 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7454256 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7454257 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7454258 yes they lost a lot of athletes but they always have great athletes coming in
7454259 they have a great tradition in the system its out go the old and in come the new there isnt a lot of drop off in athleticism and talent experience yes but not talent
7454260 theyre unsettled in the quarterback and their strength is the running back
7454261 they have a couple of nice tight ends theyll probably use the key is to be ready to adjust
7454262 weve seen a ton of different looks that our defense gives us
7454263 they do so many different things different coverages rotations and blitzes weve seen a lot of good defensive football in camp
7454264 im pumped we started watching film and i started getting butterflies in my stomach and everything im a college football junkie and im in heaven
7454265 you take one look at those amazing blue helmets and see the wolverines and all the history of that great program and you have to be excited
7454266 the utah michigan game probably will take the spotlight from us but thats ok
7454267 utah is going into the big house and they have a chance to do something big its going to be a big thing here in utah for everybody to be able to watch and see how utah does
7454268 the tv the attention it gets its great different than playing a conference team for us
7454269 anytime you play such a familiar school one that everybody knows what their helmet is youve got to be ready to play
7454270 the only way you can do that get national recognition is go and win big games
7454271 if byu and utah start fast they will probably be underdogs that is a great way to have this conference say were no longer going to be overlooked that is one way to do it and who knows throw tcu in there as a third team playing oklahoma
7454272 i think northern iowa the more i learn about them the more impressed i am
7454273 no words can really express how i feel right now how the team feels its just a great feeling its something were so proud of
7454274 it will probably go down in history as one of the greatest olympic games ever
7454275 and to be sitting here on top of the world i think we did a hell of a job putting american basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7454276 we had a game plan and they countered our game plan by making some incredible plays every possession counted tonight for all 40 minutes you couldnt take one possession off one second off
7454277 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals but what you saw today was a team a team buying together and facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7454278 wed rather win by 30 but we knew it was going to be close we went through everybody and we got it done
7454279 when i was their age i would have said no chance fortunately for me im still playing wonderful golf

7454317 sen clinton has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care

7454344 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7454345 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7454346 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7454347 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7454348 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it

7454375 as a yearling he got an infection which spread to one of his knees
7454376 every morning for six months we had to drain the knee
7454377 then i gave him a long time off and because he was so immature he only had short preparations
7454378 this horse has only just reached maturity now and we are just starting to see the best of him now
7454379 the businesses donated money and then we put a bucket in the general store for donations
7454380 id go in there and look in the bucket to see that people were putting 10s and 20s in there it just shows what a community can do if it works together and thats the kind of community clunes has
7454381 if we had tried to get a grant we would probably still be going through red tape
7454382 its important that we did this because almost every other town has one and there are a lot of people in clunes who have served their country its important to recognise them

7454403 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7454404 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7454405 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7454406 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7454407 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

7454428 i think that would be a smooth transition for him
7454429 if that happens hopefully he can come in and really not miss a beat its not like its a foreign position for him
7454430 we know we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7454431 hes a pro bowler you cant replace somebody like that without feeling it a little bit but we understand we have enough people here to get the job done
7454432 i think it is in the best interest of our team and our player that he hears anything that i have to say from me to him first
7454433 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time

7454516 the magnitude of chrmcs proposed on and off campus expansion in a low scale low density area outside of any urban village is wholly in conflict with the urban village growth strategy that is the foundation of the citys comprehensive plan
7454517 when chrmc proposed its current master plan for the laurelhurst campus adopted in 1994 it argued that it was essential to have its clinical and research space in close proximity on the same campus
7454518 chrmc has proposed 194 psychiatric beds this large a psychiatric facility would likely have economies of scale allowing for a viable separate campus or co location with one of the other existing psychiatric hospitals in the seattle area a reasonable discussion of alternatives would include chrmcs establishment of a pediatric psychiatric hospital at a location separate from the current campus
7454519 in seattle swedish hospitals inpatient pediatric services now care for more king county children than does chrmc
7454520 if its repairable they did the right thing for the player at the expense of the season
7454521 if youre a player you want it repaired as long as it heals it will be as good as new
7454522 if they dont repair it there is no reason he should miss more than a month
7454523 chrmc has purchased 9 or 30 of the 30 single family homes that are on streets around the perimeter of its campus the 5 houses associated with talaris on ne 45th street are not included in this calculation
7454524 right now things arent going my way you just have to keep battling and keep working this team needs me a lot
7454525 the last two weeks i have a little bit of inflammation in my arm i feel better now
7454526 theres nothing you can do about the first 4 1 2 months
7454527 i dont feel like we need to sweep but we cant afford to lose another series
7454528 plans call for about 25 percent more retail space at the upscale open air seattle shopping center and a similar increase in the number of parking stalls when all the work is done the plans say the number of parking spaces would increase about 28 percent from 1 938 to 2 474
7454529 but the day that people will have understood who you were they will bite the earth with sadness and remorse they will water it with their tears and they will build temples to you
7454530 as you know childrens has purchased several homes directly on the east and south perimeters of the hospital campus childrens board of trustees approved these purchases in order obtain some homes to lease to childrens faculty and staff who want to be near the hospital and avoid commuting

7454548 the government has stopped all dialogue with us after we had one with the chief minister six months ago all promises including withdrawal of cases against the tribals are forgotten its the government and not us who created this situation in kalinga nagar and people anywhere will rise in revolt whenever the government behaves in such fashion
7454549 to take effective steps for removal of the blockade over the said highway immediately
7454550 we are trying our best to implement the high court by persuading the tribals to remove the blockade
7454551 we are hopeful that the tribals would agree for removal of the blockade in view of the high court order
7454552 however there has been no consensus on this so far
7454553 the paternal lineage of indian lower castes shows closer affinity to the tribal populations than to upper castes
7454554 indian tribal and caste populations emerge from the genetic heritage of pleistocene southern and western asians
7454555 at the same time the paternal lineage of indian castes is more closely related to the central asians
7454556 this is because it is impossible to withdraw charges like murder arson and rioting
7454557 before the scheduled fight we keep the cock in a dark room for one week cocks are kept in dark to ignite their anger and on the day of fight no food is served to them so that their anger goes on its peak
7454558 cloves are given to cocks keep them warm the fight continues till one cock sustains serious injuries or dies
7454559 i regularly watch cockfights it gives us immense pleasure and we enjoy the fight this is our medium of entertainment
7454560 former chief minister arjun munda had not taken the issue seriously and he did not feel right to approach the prime minister and president over the issue
7454561 in 1951 the number of reserved seats in the assembly was 32 which was reduced to 28 in 1971 and now it is to be reduce to 21 if this trend continues then in future there will be no reserved seats for the tribal people
7454562 the recommendation of the delimitation commission is a matter of serious concern a law should be framed to protect the reserved seats for the tribal people
7454563 i was never consulted on the issue a team of ministers was formed during the nda regime but what they did i could not tell
7454564 the silence of our two chief ministers caused the problem
7454565 this is a disturbing document and the business of setting up vigilante groups is infusing the country with violence
7454566 we are entering an era where we have to become a police or an army state and they will become the implementers of the great indian growth rate dream
7454567 at the initiation of cavow a team visited the area between september 30 and november 18 2006 to investigate the conditions of safety security life and livelihood of tribal women
7454568 women have been raped and molested dole being given out to people is insufficient ration does not last for the whole week international organisations working out of the area have documented that there is malnutrition and hunger minors are being recruited as special police officers and under trial women in jails are victims of sexual abuse
7454569 strange things are happening there in the wake of salwa judum villages are deserted and whatever little civic amenities are available are in the relief camps spos are underage and have been alienated from normal life though we have no direct evidence of violence against women our team met women lodged in prisons who have been abused these village women claim they have been accused of having links with naxals
7454570 no prior intimation was given to us this is a troubled area and the industrial house concerned is responsible for such recklessness
7454571 the visthapan virodhi janmanch is welcome to have discussion on any issue without any pre condition
7454572 being a leader of the masses landlords perceived threat from him
7454573 this is not just the tale of my daughter there are many children in the village who have met the same fate
7454574 not only women and children but the workers who get into the mines to dig out uranium ore and man the tailing ponds where the waste generated from the mills is dumped suffer from serious ailments like bone blood and kidney disorders brain damage and nausea
7454575 we are planning to do it more intensively and in a well coordinated manner
7454576 they are not christians but they are hindus in fact and dont call it conversion as we are just bringing them back to the fold of their ancestors religion
7454577 as i am ill following a minor operation names of all office bearers and executive members of the janmanch except me are included in the 17 member list
7454578 the situation is under control and an additional police force has been deployed in the area
7454579 tension prevailed on friday but there has not been any major incidence of violence since thursday evening most tribals who had gathered here from nearby villages have returned to their homes the army remains on a stand by while extra police force has been deployed
7454580 a medical test of the victim will be conducted soon
7454581 three or four jawans of the mizo battalion caught her and took her to a desolate place where they raped her
7454582 the police refused to register a case when the family members of the victim went to lodge a complaint they even suggested that the family opt for a compromise
7454583 the victim was selling liquor in the weekly haat the mizo police personnel had an altercation with her as she wanted more money for the liquor how is it possible to rape someone on the day of the haat when hundreds of people are present in the village
7454584 we will exercise our franchise but we know for sure that the candidates will not take up the issues they are raking up now for the sake of votes
7454585 foundation stone for the project was laid three times by leaders with much fanfare but it is yet to materialise
7454586 we will submit a memorandum to the chief minister over the matter when he comes to lathi village
7454587 if the chief minister had timely monitored the implementation of the supreme court order on the management of the rishabdev temple the unfortunate situation would not have arisen
7454588 the ministers are openly levelling charges of corruption deceit and moral turpitude against one another they have no time to govern after their preoccupations the people are paying a heavy price for their squabbles
7454589 the bjp rule has fragmented the social fabric of rajasthan
7454590 the officials told us that theres no proof that we are legal settlers they said they will carry the logs and then file cases and send us all to jail
7454591 a similar thing happened years ago when the officials felled trees but filed cases for illegal felling against us
7454592 the government spends so much money on forest conservation and takes huge loans from the world bank
7454593 in principle a forest so well protected by local tribals should not have been touched secondly the norms for felling have been violated by the forest department
7454594 it is a game of money those who are poor have no say in politics and they remain neglected and downtrodden and same is the case with tribal people heavens were promised to tribal people before creation of the state and now their voices have been crushed those who never participated in the jharkhand movement are the ones who rule the state now and the poor tribal never figured in their agenda
7454595 we had sent the women for medical examination and the report is awaited
7454596 we are making arrangements to send these tribal women to their native places in bihar once the examination are over
7454597 they threw our belongings and children out of the houses beat up our men and raped me and other women
7454598 when we came to know about the incident thursday afternoon we immediately sent a team to the site
7454599 but they would not succeed in the nefarious designs as there was now awareness among the tribals about their religion and traditions
7454600 i was overwhelmed when i came to know rs 100 rupees invested by me would beget rs 1 200 per year for my sons education
7454601 it is a cms scheme and he would know the answer
7454602 the peace initiative that we attempted sincerely and proper implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation measures paid dividends
7454603 we shall continue our fast unto death agitation till our problem is resolved permanently
7454604 the tripura government all the political parties in the state and the union government are sympathetic towards your cause and struggle new delhi has taken certain steps to solve your problems
7454605 we cannot obey any decision if it affects our life and livelihood the agitation against the industrialisation will continue unless we get a written assurance from the chief minister
7454606 we will not give our land and houses for any industry in the area
7454607 i was happy with the way villagers came out to protest against land acquisition when i visited singur some 15 000 villagers gathered to say that they would not give away their land it was more heartening to note that most of these protesters were women
7454608 the residents critically depend on collection of various non timber forest produces ntfps for their sustenance restrictions of forest department on collection of ntfps inside the sanctuary area have led to serious livelihood crisis for villagers
7454609 the problems get further complicated when the forest department charge entry fee on villagers we are branded like a criminals on our own land
7454610 my wife bhagyamma gave birth to a female baby for the third time
7454611 a daughter is a burden and we decided not to feed her so she died
7454612 it is very difficult to bring up girls and marry them off
7454613 my daughter died two days after birth since we did not feed her
7454614 we already have two girls and cant afford to have one more
7454615 buggamma had said beforehand that she would kill the child if it was female
7454616 after the baby was born we told her that goddess lakshmi had come to her home only after that did she feed the baby
7454617 the villagers told our constables that the babies were stillborn or were premature
7454618 we have to give a scooter five to six tolas of gold and rs 50 000 cash to a good groom
7454619 even in the matter of awarding compensation to the deceased in police firing a tribal is discriminated against in rajasthan
7454620 without going into the un justifiability of police firing which is a separate issue the rajasthan pradesh congress committee submits that even in tragedies the bjp state government is not desisting from making discrimination against adivasis
7454621 what the people here are demanding are their rights a letter from the defence ministry states that the land in and around ranchi airport belongs to the defence establishment and that the villagers have no legal right over it and that members of the scheduled tribes have encroached on it we are asking for a re look into the matter
7454622 we spoke about the problem to the prime minister and he said that a committee will be constituted to look into the matter we also want the government to provide rice and wheat at competitive prices to the villagers we will continue to raise our voice till the government addresses the needs of the villagers
7454623 people are being deprived of their democratic rights and are not being allowed to participate in developmental activities as the government is not holding panchayat elections in the state we want to know why the government has not yet looked into our problems
7454624 i am relieved after the assurance from the prime minister
7454625 after we submitted the mem orandum to the prime minister he said that he finds no problem as to why it should not be done
7454626 we have ostracised them because they didnt follow our customs and traditions they also sent their daughters out side the village to appear for the test which is against our tradition
7454627 the entire process has been like a revelation to me and my parents
7454628 we will be spending an amount of about rs 1 lakh on each of these girls however this amount is nothing when we consider the fact that they will be breaking new ground
7454629 i think there is a definite correlation between our cases as both of us tried for a profession that has not generally been associated with our communities in her case as a woman and in my case as a tribal
7454630 unless we are able to secure a job for each of these trained students we wont consider our responsibility complete
7454631 we were surprised about 40 police personnel many of them in civilian clothes surrounded us at kharagpur railway station and asked why we were going to nandigram we told them we were going to express our solidarity with the people of nandigram but they herded us into a waiting van
7454632 police looked keen to know if the tribal group had any links with maoists though they gave us food they did not allow us to move out
7454633 the west bengal polices action on our delegation is unfortunate and as an attempt to curb the democratic rights there is no difference between kalinga nagar and nandigram hence the people of kalinga nagar thought it was their duty to stand by the people of nandigram in their hour of crisis nandigram tribals had come here to console us after the ghastly police firing our men had gone there to empathise with them on humanitarian point of view as a friend in need besides the delegation will express our solidarity with the farmers who are agitating against the left front governments bid to procure land for indonesian based salem group
7454634 a majority of these cases had been pending for many years and as most of these offenders were involved in minor crimes we decided to let them off with a warning
7454635 while the congress has maintained a stronghold in the non tribal districts the bjp doesnt want to lose its hold over tribal constituencies which have been our supporters
7454636 around 2 000 acres of land was acquired by the defence coordination committee in 1942 the land was not acquired under the land acquisition act 1894 and the tribals were not given compensation
7454637 wherever we have visited we have found negligible presence of gynaecologists in koraput rayagada and malkanagiri the women demanded appointment of women doctors to address their problems
7454638 reduction of nine points in nine years in mmr is not an encouraging sign in fact there has not been any significant reduction in the rate of maternal deaths in the last few years what is worrisome is that maternal mortality is far greater in rural areas than in urban areas
7454639 we are having sleepless nights and feeling greatly insecure after the threat like me many people working here are in a quandary
7454640 we are not going to spell out what course of action we would take once the deadline expires but something is going to happen and we shall throw them out
7454641 these migrant workers are a bunch of criminals who have been indulging in looting murders and even raping our tribal women
7454642 in the event of bankruptcy permission to non tribals for participating in the auction of tribal land will open the floodgate the relaxation in the existing law indicates that there are deeper interests at work
7454643 if 57 98 per cent of tribal people have been taking loans for their daily consumption for years now the state government should first assess as to how much land have been left with the tribal people if this relaxation comes in place the rest 10 81 per cent population will enter the ring of indebtedness in no time
7454644 the problem of land sale to obtain money faced by a miniscule proportion of tribals can be easily solved by either setting up a line of credit by integrated tribal development agency or banks based on land mortgage or by setting up a tribal land purchase and distribution scheme
7454645 roughly 3 000 tribals are encroaching on the forestland a notice was served earlier by the district administration after repeated warnings proved futile forest revenue and district administration officials reached the place and began the process of eviction
7454646 police did not use even mild force on the crowd despite the incident
7454647 according to the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers act 2006 a person who occupied such land prior to 2005 could be labeled an encroacher
7454648 in case when finally decision is taken to declare an area as critical wildlife area the rehabilitation plan should be prepared by the government in active consultation and participation with the people of the area
7454649 there should be a time limit of 180 days for the completion of the whole process of initiation of the process of identification or rights by the gram sabha till the final vesting of rights by the district level committees
7454650 there is scope to transform it into a street play also
7454651 the bodies will be exhumed and if evidence is found they were killed by security personnel legal action will follow
7454652 gujarat ki bimaari sab jagah phaila rahein hai log the naxalites are savages we are not into these things
7454653 these were sangham members and we had gone to these villages to conduct a search mission there was an encounter and we were forced to act
7454654 the commission has ceased to exist without completing the inquiry process in view of the supreme courts rejection of the state governments appeal
7454655 it is my way of telling them that i am with you
7454656 i would like to continue this practice at least once in a month to follow the chief minister
7454657 this is the first time i am staying in the residence of an ordinary villager after becoming the deputy chief minister however i used to stay with farmers and agricultural labourers in my native constituency of shikaripura when i was the bjp president of shimoga district in mid 80s
7454658 you cannot enact a law and enforce it but i will appeal to them
7454659 forest department has been trying to take up plantations on land cultivated by tribals and other forest dwellers in order to evict the tribals in balangir nuapada and kandhamal district
7454660 even after four months of the passing of the act it has not been notified the forest department is continuing with eviction of tribal and forest dwellers from forestland in many tribal dominated district such as bolangir kandhamal nuapada and sundargarh
7454661 far from being a peaceful campaign salwa judum activists are armed with guns lathis axes bows and arrows
7454662 as of january 2007 more than 47 000 people were living in relief camps the condition of these camps are deplorable nutrition especially child nutrition has been badly affected with inmates of these camps receiving scant rations
7454663 we neither support nor oppose the conversion of mane and other nomadic tribals it is their own decision and why should we discuss it
7454664 they are just altering the methods of worship after all buddhism is a part of hindu dharma so it is an internal matter of hindus
7454665 manes conversion will not harm the nation or the hinduism as buddhism is the integral part of hindu religion
7454666 tribals never followed hinduism so theres no question of relinquishing it all these years we suffered at the hands of hindus now we want to live as human beings buddhism will give us a sense of belonging
7454667 if we keep mum anyone will come and start speaking against hindus we are being told officially that we should not react to mane and his conversion campaign but there are heated discussions in the parivar on what stand we should take
7454668 anticipating that the tribals will get permanent settlement rights once the tribal act is implemented
7454669 it is unfortunate that this is the state of affairs in a district represented by the state forest minister and a minister of state at the centre
7454670 the fact is that not a single girl of the school has spoken against the character and nature of sahu
7454671 the lands were under shifting cultivation customarily claimed by tribal communities and their rights were not recorded during the survey and settlement and such lands were either recorded as government wasteland or forest land
7454672 the recent attempt of ofdc to invite plantation on 25 villages under machkunda area on revenue land should be stopped and the lands should be distributed among the landless
7454673 at least the birth certificates of our children would prove that we are living on jungle land for generations other wise who will come over to these remote places to give birth certificates to their children
7454674 if a woman is a tribal her offspring can claim scheduled tribe status
7454675 due to this language dualism local students often do not find education interesting forcing some of them to drop out of the school
7454676 most teachers employed in these schools communicate in hindi our plan is to encourage them to learn any one of the local languages so that they can do their job well
7454677 we found the bodies of the two tribal hostages early on wednesday from konta area they had multiple injury marks around the neck
7454678 the victims mental health had deteriorated due to long confinement he is undergoing psychiatric treatment at vss medical college hospital in burla and is finding it very difficult to meet the hospital expenses
7454679 the central governments motive is not clear if the government wanted to clear the bill then it could have passed it in the parliament instead of sending back for research work
7454680 the state government should expedite the research work and send the report to the centre so that these castes could be included in st category there is proof that kurmi and mahto were in st list before 1950
7454681 congress is playing politics over the issue the central government kept the bill pending for three years and now it has sent it back we will soon convene a meeting of kurmi leaders and decide the future course of action and how to put pressure on both the state and central government to push the bill
7454682 those abducted were returning from bangagudem village of khammam district in andhra pradesh after attending a wedding
7454683 a combing operation has been launched and police parties have been rushed to help track down the abducted people
7454684 over the past few weeks we have seen an increase in such incidents and believe that naxalites are trying to seek information regarding security deployment around salwa judum camps movement of the force and other local intelligence
7454685 the per capita income of many districts seems to be high but it may not necessarily reflect the situation on the ground
7454686 the high infant mortality rate indicates poor health services and facilities which warrant immediate government intervention in the health sector
7454687 the naxalite movement is neither an adivasi movement nor is it led by them but the indigenous groups do form the majority of the cadres of the naxalites
7454688 about 13 000 families have already filled up the forms and sent them to our office in these forms they have given details of the land they cultivate and live on and on which they have rights
7454689 once the exercise is complete we will send the forms to the state government for action
7454690 after sonia gandhis january rally at devgadh baria drew a massive response modi announced a package worth rs 15 000 crore for tribals but he has not explained where the money will come from and how it will be spent
7454691 no projects in sikkim shall be considered for environment clearance until the carrying capacity of the teesta basin is completed
7454692 the idea is to highlight the problems of the panchayats and villages of the district through these newspapers we try to create awareness among the people and teach them about the government programmes
7454693 villagers contribute in content and help us in writing news before scripting the news we verify the facts and only then the news are written
7454694 we have formed clusters and one cluster constitutes five panchayats at present three clusters are bringing out newspapers with different names
7454695 for block level newspapers we will select news from cluster newspapers which needs to be highlighted at block levels
7454696 we have got our voice in the form of handwritten newspapers we raise the basic issues that are overlooked by major newspapers no newspaper reaches our village radio is the only medium of information
7454697 we are actively participating in bringing out the newspaper we love to work as village reporters
7454698 we are compared with maoist people say that we bring out pamphlets during the day and maoists do the same thing during night but we are trying to associate people and make it newspapers of local people
7454699 after 60 years of independence the tribal people were still living in forests it was my dream to change that in a small way today there are children here from most of the 52 tribes of orissa including 13 primitive tribes this year we added 700 more tribal children to reach the strength of 5 000
7454700 conditions of work and promotion of livelihoods in the unorganised sector
7454701 the mandate of the constitution is supreme and the election commission has no scope to go beyond the constitution
7454702 it should be made clear that the mandate of article 332 3 of the constitution should always be kept in mind article 332 3 mandates that the reservation must be made in proportion to the population of the scs and sts of the state this should be the paramount consideration of the election commission and not any other consideration
7454703 though now the issue is purely academic because the election commission having realised its mistake has reduced the number of seats of sts from three to two and the notification to this effect has already been issued in order to justify the order dated november 5 2001 the election commission has made certain observations which need not be repeated again
7454704 now that the 2007 elections have already taken place we are not disturbing the elections on this ground but in future sts vacancy should be treated as two only we hope and trust that when any notification is issued the election commission shall confine itself to the mandate of the provisions of the constitution and will not be swayed by any other consideration
7454705 gujarat is the only state which has allowed tribals to cultivate forest land and has given land rights to them
7454706 the proposal of issuing land rights to 4 000 tribals has been pending with the central government for the last three years if no decision is taken in this regard by october 2 the gujarat government will provide land rights to them and break the law
7454707 it is dangerous to promote religion based reservation and conversion equal importance should be given to all religions
7454708 during this period the victim would be allowed to withdraw 75 per cent of the monthly interest he would be at liberty to withdraw the whole amount after maturity
7454709 right to life and personal liberty of any person cannot be curtailed by the state so the victim should be awarded compensation for the loss of eight precious years of his life for no fault of his
7454710 a poor man doesnt deserve lesser compensation for the violation of his rights by the state
7454711 justice for a poor tribal boy after 18 years is not something to cheer about but it is nevertheless praiseworthy
7454712 we have called a strike on tuesday to protest against the dci recommendations on september 2 we have called a meeting of tribal scholars and different tribal organisations to discuss the issue and chalk out future strategy
7454713 we will soon call a meeting of our leaders and decide future course of action if needed we will stop coal and other mineral productions in the state and support the proposed economic blockade in the state
7454714 we will invoke economic blockade in the state if the central government fails to take suitable steps to jeopardise the recommendation of the dci the centre can reject the recommendations if it wants
7454715 when i sent stalin the dsp of chintapalli to the village no woman gave a statement to this effect
7454716 they have also sent the material for further examination at the ap forensic sciences laboratory in hyderabad
7454717 the government will certainly take action against those found guilty
7454718 our party supported the strike as we are against the dci recommendation
7454719 dci has just made a recommendation and the central government is yet to take a decision on the issue we have conveyed the sentiments of the people to the central government
7454720 adivasis have only given to the world we have taken nothing the government says keeps promising us pieces of paper that are supposed to grant our rights but then demand other pieces of paper from us first as evidence which is exactly what they have always denied
7454721 the government has to recognise the true democracy is when the gram sabha decides until the gram sabha is given its due powers this act will be rendered a weapon against the people
7454722 does not provide for the lungs of the forests which are our carbon sink
7454723 unless we attach livelihood of the tribals and the forest dwellers to forests we cannot conserve forests
7454724 can a small bridge be built on a mountain stream within three days which can make his village accessible to dongasili
7454725 certain development has been made in the kbk areas but more things have to be done particularly in the field of creating public awareness
7454726 the doordarshan channel for jammu and kashmir dd kashir launched by the government of india with the objective of countering pakistani media propaganda from across the border has failed to serve its purpose in the tribal language gojri spoken by nomad gujjars of the state
7454727 i call it cultural aggression against the gujjars of jammu and kashmir as the channel does not telecast even a five minute programme in gojri the language of about 25 per cent of the states population in its 24x7 telecasts and does not cover remote villages and tribal population of the state in their own mother tongue which is most affected by militancy it therefore fails to counter the massive anti india propaganda launched by pakistan television through its powerful transmitters in gojri along the border
7454728 we are demanding a 10 minute gojri news bulletin from doordarshan kendra srinagar and jammu
7454729 this needs to be countered at the earliest so that they may not exploit and misguide the gujjar tribal population of the state in the name of region or religion
7454730 we will protest with the help of thousands of tribals to show government that the action against tribals was unjustified
7454731 police were beating up few tribals sitting near khotrampura crossroads without any reason police personnel are from nearby police stations and hence the tribals have no option to even lodge a complaint
7454732 this issue was not between police and tribals tribal have problems with forest department so why would police attack tribals in such a delicate situation complaint has been lodged against 57 people and actions will be taken against them but we are cautious enough that any action by us should not create tension in the area
7454733 tribals in chhattisgarh are caught between the salwa judum and maoists and are paying the price
7454734 the salwa judum was formed as an outfit aimed at peoples participation but their activities are something different for the past few months
7454735 but the situation has deteriorated in chhattisgarh jharkhand and parts of orissa
7454736 the committee constituted by the prime minister to assess the social educational and economical status of muslims in india has not addressed the concerns of nomadic muslim tribes
7454737 the report mainly focuses on the issues of settled muslims and ignores the muslim nomadic tribes the gurjjars of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh who fall under scheduled tribes
7454738 the report has not addressed the concerns of tribal community issues like right to vote recognition of traditional judiciary system popular among muslim tribes political empowerment of muslim sts safeguarding their socio economic rights and issue related to their ethnic cultural and lingual identity have not been addressed
7454739 urgently intervene on the issue to ensure that an important achievement of the upa government is not weakened or even subverted by the non notification of the act
7454740 the committee for drafting rules was formed in march 2007 and submitted the draft rules in may 2007
7454741 the rules were posted on the website for public comments on june 19 2007 and the last date decided by the ministry was july 31 2007 it was expected that the rules would be finalised and the act notified
7454742 forest officials who have been responsible for denial of tribal rights have taken advantage of the situation and evicted the tribals from many areas land cultivated by tribals for decades is being dug up for plantations by the forest department in some states in an obvious attempt to preempt the recognition of the tribal rights on that land at the same time there are reports of connivance between land mafia and officials to take illegal possession of land this is a most untenable situation
7454743 the tribal people have a great tradition of forbearance they should not waste their time and money in fighting prolonged legal battles
7454744 teacher educators from rural areas on action research related to gender issues with focus on upliftment of st girls
7454745 for the past three years we have been organising training programmes focussing on girls from scheduled caste categories this is the first time that the emphasis is on st girls the st girls face problems like cultural alienation and language barrier in a milieu like this teachers have to serve as change agents
7454746 a relocation package consisting essentially of cash compensation will then be provided to those being resettled from these habitats allowing for large scale corruption and leaving people stranded with no livelihood vested interests are pushing for this to be done before the forest rights act is brought into force
7454747 it will not be permissible to include or specify all the kui language speakers as st
7454748 in entry 31 at the end insert kondh kui buda kondh bura kondh desia kondh dungria kondh kutia kondh kondh gauda muli kondh maula kondh pengo kondh raja kondh and raj kondh
7454749 it is a well known fact that kondh kond and kandha tribes in orissa speak kui language there are other communities and castes including pana pano who live in their neighbourhood and speak the same language
7454750 this is not scientific and is being done in haste these boundaries are to be mapped in all the tiger reserves in 30 days how can a site specific process meant to be based on real ecological situation be completed within 30 days
7454751 now it is the opposite everybody wants to become backward and prove that they are primitive
7454752 we have no choice to get what we want we have to highlight the negative aspects of our community
7454753 it shows how scared and isolated we are from the rest of the world
7454754 we are simultaneously taking the assistance of experts to analyse the documents we are being given also all data is being computerised and we should be able to wind up by december 15
7454755 the titles to the remaining 2 204 tribals would be dispatched to their addresses
7454756 we have to create awareness among the people particularly the tribals regarding their legal rights and it is proposed to hold legal awareness camps at the grass root level
7454757 we thank the district legal aid authorities for taking the initiative to inform us about our legal rights and making us aware of the different laws we are proud that the judges whom we could have never seen except in courts came to our doorsteps we being tribals fear the judicial department and police but we got an opportunity of interacting with them today
7454758 ownership for close to five lakh acres of forest land can be given to tribals and non tribals who have been cultivating the forest lands for years
7454759 the earlier legislations prevented government from issuing pattas to the tiller but the new act will be a boon for the forest dwellers
7454760 however this time we celebrated the festival inside the forest we thought since we depend on forest resources for our livelihood and wildlife is an integral part of the forest people should realise their roles in conservation efforts
7454761 the gesture on part of villagers is a good beginning integration of conservation models with the popular festivals would go a long way in addressing conservation goals
7454762 both the above orders granting stay by the supreme court are still continuing in view of this grant of titles of forest land to any person will be in violation of the orders of the sc
7454763 we are hosting the second peoples parliament at mawphlang to draw the attention of the global community to this sacred forest site which has been protected and preserved by our ancestors for centuries
7454764 the sacred forest is the abode of the ryngkew basa the forest spirit which is a treasure trove of rare plants medicinal herbs and orchids
7454765 we need to protect and preserve them for the posterity
7454766 the continued failure of the government to notify the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers recognition of forest rights act 2006 is a betrayal of the people
7454767 the delay in notifying it was causing unrest among people facing repression and brutal violence in various parts of the country
7454768 by the time the centre notifies the act we will not have enough time to translate it into votes
7454769 we want to see the festival the goddess and serve her with flowers while earning some money to spend during the fest
7454770 we are in the process of translating the rules in hindi now they are likely to be completed early next week
7454771 since the act itself provides for critical wildlife habitats there was no need to incorporate them in the rules wherever the act is explicit the rules remain silent
7454772 every community or group has a right under the constitution to put forth its demand in a peaceful manner
7454773 however the present tension is also due to the government trying to play up one community against the other
7454774 i hope everyone would keep it in mind that tomorrow is gandhi jayanti
7454775 the chief minister busy handling protests and agitations and dissidence within her party is left with no time to give any time for governance
7454776 pcc changes are a regular process and the leadership is not decided on caste lines
7454777 the mood is upbeat and our determination is strong no one here is ready for talks we are all eager to get arrested and mark our protest it does not matter how long we have to stay behind bars we want reservation
7454778 we begin this movement in rajasthan but if we do not get reservation within the next four days the movement will spread to the rest of the country as gujjars from others states will also court arrests
7454779 we have been asked to maintain a record of details thumb impressions and photographs of those arrested the prisoners will not be allowed to carry any of their belongings and will be given food served in jails they will be allowed to meet visitors once in seven days
7454780 we came here to get st status our womenfolk will resume the agitation from october 11
7454781 at least 65 000 people came to protest and half of them offered themselves for arrest we are making lists we are making lists of those willing to stay in jail
7454782 they should wait for the chopra commissions report it is difficult to recommend gujjars for st status without the commissions report
7454783 communal and casteist forces have created an unprecedented situation in rajasthan in which the people are feeling insecure
7454784 the bjp only instigated the gujjars and now they are finding it difficult to manage the situation some congress leaders from the gujjar community joining the issue has only aggravated the situation further
7454785 the prevailing atmosphere in the state is such that even small personal quarrels can turn into a communal flare up
7454786 this is due to the spread of mutual distrust and lack of harmony the atmosphere remains surcharged
7454787 a good number of mlas are also found to be taking money for getting transfers of teachers and other state government employees
7454788 we are trying to push the crowds away to pave way for the restoration of rail tracks

7454793 theres going to be times when i go three days four days in a row
7454794 its all about the team it doesnt matter the individual stats
7454795 he has to get a single to score roberts is on third base and he can stay there

7454798 he didnt want me to come up to the plate after the day i was having
7454799 so he went kind of like i dont want you to come here
7454800 i wish i had the answer to that i think teams sometimes go through a stretch of where youre not quite clicking on all cylinders weve played pretty good baseball for a long stretch so eventually some things are going to happen
7454801 we felt we were going to be able to win todays ballgame after we got that three run lead
7454802 what the bloody hell has mrs m been buying now

7454812 we have to take in everything and make a decision
7454813 we want to do whats best for john maine and we want to do whats best for this team were in a pennant race
7454814 but i think the good thing is we do have some people performing we have played as a team for a long period of time good baseball right now is not the time to be not executing pitches or not having quality at bats its just not the time but we are still in a good spot
7454815 they asked me what i want to do and i want to pitch
7454816 it didnt stop me so far theres only two months left no big deal
7454817 right now we have to do the job when we have the ball we have to try to win games
7454818 we can throw 150 pitches weve just got to be ready and keep pitching
7454819 its just one day one game tomorrow well be back
7454820 whats at stake is no less than the continued viability of the american economy and the american dream the gradual decline of america as an economic and technological superpower
7454821 much of what ails schools these days is a matter of management organizational and communications discipline michigan is doing some things well here
7454822 youre in business can you imagine running your business without key metrics of success
7454823 will require nothing less than recreating the apparatus of american education

7454828 it was a catclysmic event but it was not an inexplicable event
7454829 perhaps the most profound tragedy is that we live with it still
7454830 we continue to carry the weight of our segregationist past and it is an awesome burden we dont have to though we can shrug it off but only if were willing to try and if we do we can build in detroit the sort of city that never was but could be

7454834 were going to lose economically folks if we dont repeal this prohibition
7454835 this is going to be another economic blow to a state that cant take any more economic blows
7454836 when i know behind the scenes many of my republican colleagues are very supportive
7454837 here we are trying to diversify and invest in the life sciences but weve got our hands tied behind our backs in the most innovative and promising area of the field
7454838 the governor has the authority to call the legislature for special sessions
7454839 just like your mom used to tell you get your chores done before you go out and play thats true for legislators as well
7454840 insist that nobody goes on summer vacation until we get this done
7454841 the entire judiciary the entire legislature the entire executive the department of agriculture military affairs all the rest of state government
7454842 has to make michigan competitive it has to be fair it has to be simple and it has to turn the single business tax on its head and provide credits and incentives for people to locate here and create jobs
7454843 im not a particularly patient person and my favorite meeting is me in the room with a pen
7454844 if i could do this by myself i would do it but we have legislative colleagues and a system of government with a divided legislature that requires partnership you need to know that this will be done but we need your help in implementing it and we need your help in expressing a sense of urgency i know you are as frustrated as i am that there is not a resolution yet we just need the votes to make it happen if anybody knows the need for certainty it is the people in this room
7454845 a crisis is a terrible thing to waste this is a moment for us to take a crisis and transform it into opportunity
7454846 if ever there was a time to put aside purely ideological positions or partisanship this is it so calling all pragmatists and all those who are impatient let us come together to get the solution
7454847 this isnt about politics its about the future of michigan
7454848 but we wont be able to get there until we resolve this budget crisis
7454849 any time you have 12 penalties and 10 of them are on offensive plays thats an issue
7454850 thats something we have to do a much better job on
7454851 it just looks really bad when they start coming in piles it just doesnt look good when you are fighting yourself it becomes second and long third and long its just not a good situation
7454852 we had some big plays that were unfortunately called back
7454853 all we have to do is watch the film to see that we have a lot of potential it just goes to show how little things can lead to big things they are things that can be corrected rather quickly and easily but you cant win making those types of mistakes
7454854 i didnt do a good enough job emphasizing getting the tackles up even tighter than they were
7454855 like i said that did come down from the league that was a point of emphasis anytime thats a point of emphasis you better get it fixed and you better get it straightened out i could have done a much better job with that the other ones were concentration errors where we had two guys moving
7454856 as disappointing as it was that those plays were called back we see at the end result how good it can be
7454857 you can say were close its a matter of opinion but the fact is if we clean those penalties up i think we can be pretty productive
7454858 my friend bryce dallas howard had done it and gwyneth paltrow and a lot of people i really care about had done it
7454859 it was a nice platform to start my hopefully directing career
7454860 we had such a hard time cutting it down our script was so good
7454861 it actually was a problem because it hasnt been accepted into a handful of different things because of the length its been one of our hurdles

7454873 the italian minister of interior is reported to have proposed that all roma including children living in camps in italy should be fingerprinted this proposal invites historical analogies which are so obvious that they do not even have to be spelled out while i believe that italian democracy and its institutions are mature enough to prevent any such ideas becoming laws i am nevertheless concerned that a senior member of the government of one of council of europe member states is reported to have made such a proposal

7454895 photoshop is a color managed application the web is not normally when you view an image in save for web or imageready you are viewing it without color management and see it how it will appear when uploaded to the web
7454896 we have concluded that although you acted with the best interests of your daughter your behaviour has led to your impartiality being brought into question
7454897 it is clear that by mentioning you were a magistrate and then criticising the police the two issues became linked and therefore there is doubt whether you would be able to consider matters involving the police impartially
7454898 on 20 september 2007 my daughter had been told by a key member of this gang that she was going to be subject to a beating possibly during the lunch break failing that definitely on her way home neither the headteacher nor the head of year would make themselves available to speak to me i told the school that in that case i would have to involve the police
7454899 mr straws action is shameful and very heavy handed why cant a magistrate criticise the police the police should not be able to end the career of a magistrate just because they dont like being criticised
7454900 i was acting as a mother who had good reason to be both furious and to question the lack of competence and ethics that were being displayed not only was my child terrified for her safety this campaign of terror was based on racism mainly her welsh accent and possibly her romany background yet the police were not doing enough to support her
7454901 i have been working in professional football for 20 years and i have never seen anything like it
7454902 i have nothing but scorn for northumbria police so much so that i will not go to another derby match again i feel nothing but sympathy for the middlesbrough supporters they were very harshly treated
7454903 police at middlesbrough station put the four of us at the bottom end of the train they operated really friendly and professionally
7454904 there were middlesbrough sunderland hartlepool and nottingham forest supporters on the train the banter was very friendly and there were no incidents
7454905 as we came into sunderland railway station we saw about 50 police on the platform many in full riot gear they opened only one door which meant we had to get off the train one at a time
7454906 ten to 20 police ran towards us shouting screaming and banging their riot gear it was unbelievable the police were very intimidating and very aggressive there were a lot of people getting pushed about who were not even going to the match
7454907 one old woman was crying her eyes out she had only gone up for the shopping
7454908 they escorted us to the exit but all the doors were locked and bolted if there had been a fire there would have been a lot of casualties
7454909 the police were provoking a lot of the trouble to be honest i might not even go back to sunderland im at an age now where i do not want the hassle
7454910 i was just really annoyed that people could be treated like this
7454911 as a magistrate i try to be fair and reasonable and look at both sides people are always innocent until proven guilty
7454912 from the intelligence and evidence we had we were aware that large numbers of risk groups from both sides would be attending the match
7454913 they arrived at the city centre early and began drinking in public houses and there was some disorder during the match
7454914 my intention at any game like this is to prevent innocent fans from being injured
7454915 we did that but the only way to police a match safely is to take a strong stand with some supporters
7454916 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
7454917 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is working night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting
7454918 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
7454919 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within

7455095 pretty things can make life better but they can also be better for life
7455096 jadi tergantung hasil pemeriksaan persidangan mana yang sesuai dengan fakta yang terungkap di persidangan dengan dakwaan dari tim jpu yaitu alternatif dua pasal itu itulah yang kita ajukan sebagai dakwaan terbukti jadi tidak dibuktikan kedua duanya
7455097 saya tidak pernah ada di monas dan tidak pernah menggerakkan massa untuk unjuk rasa
7455098 you figured id jump at the chance to go well youre wrong
7455099 you figured id jump at the chance to go well youre wrong
7455100 dakwaan yang dituduhkan terhadap ketua front pembela islam habib rizieq sangat lemah
7455101 saat itu kita tahu betul kejaksaan telah melakukan ekspos dan dalam eksposnya itu diketahui bahwa perkara itu tidak bisa disidangkan karena kurangnya bukti
7455102 ini saya kira bukan masalah teknis tapi ini masalah substansi karena di zaman seperti ini tidak boleh ada orang yang ditahan tanpa surat penahanan
7455103 ini kami melihat dari awal memang pihak kejaksaan itu kebingungan dan itu harus diakui secara jujur bahwa pihak kejaksaan melakukan persidangan persidangan ini di bawah tekanan sehingga tidak begitu ikhlas melakukan persidangan ini
7455104 karena itu kita mengambil kesimpulan bahwa pihak kejaksaan tidak punya bukti yang kuat kita lihat pertama dari proses dan faktanya yang kedua kita lihat perkara ini tidak ada perkara jelas jelas dakwaan itu sangat tidak jelas habib rizieq sendiri mengatakan bahwa beliau didzolimi
7455105 karena sejak berkas dakwaan dilimpahkan tanggal 12 agustus kemarin penahanan habib rizieq menjadi penahanan hakim
7455106 we have been doing this band with various line ups for about 10 years and after making worst band name ever i am happy to go out on a good note and pursue other fun stuff fatherhood golf taste testing

7455108 saya tidak paham tentang dakwaan pasal 170 jo 55 tersebut
7455109 saya tidak pernah ada di monas dan tidak pernah menggerakan massa untuk melakukan kekerasan
7455110 adapun tentang pasal 156 tentang menyebarkan kebencian saya tidak mengerti lagi karena ceramah tentang kesesatan ahmadiyah kemudian diartikan menyebarkan kebencian terhadap suatu golongan saya tidak paham
7455111 habib rizieq itu ulama beliau itu akan membenci sesuatu yang dibenci allah dan rasulnya dan semua ulama harus seperti itu
7455112 tindak lanjut kasus artalyta kpk harus usut kasus blbi i dan ii
7455113 metode msaa ini ternyata lebih banyak menguntungkan pihak konglomerat yang menikmati blbi
7455114 rapat rapat panja dpr dihadiri oleh para pejabat dari bi dan departemen keuangan rapatnya tidak di gedung dpr tetapi di hotel berbintang
7455115 soal kemungkinan adanya aliran dana dari bi ke beberapa anggota panja blbi hanya allah saja yang tahu
7455116 kenapa subsidi ini diberikan pada konglomerat itu bukan pada masyarakat yang sangat ingin bersekolah
7455117 itu memang sudah biasa dilakukan suap di dpr sudah mengakar bukan rahasia umum lagi hal ini dilakukan agar dpr beri dukungan kepada pihak berkepentingan
7455118 pertama dpr meminta tapi tanda kutip yang kedua memang inisiatif dari pihak yang ada keperluan
7455119 bisa berupa kwitansi diberikan tidak dalam bentuk tunai tapi dibayar dengan alasan tunjangan hari raya
7455120 annie theyre beautiful i had no idea you were an artist

7455123 1 grasi kalau saya mohon grasi akan terjatuh pada empat dosa dan kesalahan a syirk menyekutukan allah sebab presiden negara sekuler yang mengikut sistem agama demokrasi telah merampas hak hak otoritas dan kedaulatan allah dalam menciptakan dan menentukan hukum maka kalau saya mohon grasi kepadanya dalam kasus jihad seperti yang saya lakukan berarti saya mengakui ketuhanannya b haram karena syirk hukumnya haram dilakukan bahkan termasuk haram dan dosa yang paling besar c dalam kehinaan saya seorang mujahid di pihak yang benar karena membela agama allah dan membela kaum muslimin sedang presiden dalam hal ini bukan di pihak yang benar dan bukan di pihak allah tapi di pihak thaghut syetan jadi kalau saya memohon kepada pihak yang tidak benar maka perbuatan saya tersebut lebih tidak benar lagi dan merupakan kehinaan d membantu kezaliman hukum yang dipakai untuk mengadili kasus saya jihad adalah hukum thaghut yang bertentangan dengan alquran dan assunah hukum allah bahkan yang lebih lucu lagi bertentangan dengan hukum positif thaghut yang sedang berlaku di negeri ini maka kalau saya mohon grasi berarti setuju dengan praktik hukum yang salah itu dan bermakna membantah telah membantu kezaliman yang wajib ditentang dan akan menjadi catatan hitam dalam sejarah 2 eksekusi tanggapan saya tentang rencana eksekusi a mati syahid adalah cita citaku idamanku dan dambaanku jadi kalau allah ta ala menakdirkan diri saya dibunuh oleh orang orang kafir termasuk orang orang munafik dan orang orang murtad dengan cara eksekusi berarti cita citaku yang paling tinggi tercapai alhamdulillah b saya sebagai seorang muslim yang beraqidah salaf dan komitmen dengan syariat allah haram atas saya menyetujui eksekusi sebab eksekusi atau membunuh seorang muslim apalagi seorang mujahid dengan sengaja dan direncanakan tanpa kebenaran dari allah adalah perbuatan kriminal dan dosa besar sekali seluruh yang terlibat mendapat kemurkaan dan kutukan allah dan dimasukkan ke dalam neraka jahanam selamanya qs an nisa 4 93 dan untuk hukum di dunia seluruh yang terlibat wajib diqishas darah dengan darah jiwa dengan jiwa nusakambangan syaban 1429 h hamba allah ditandatangani red mukhlas alias red ali ghufron bin nurhasyim

7455163 more than anything else 20 to 25 years of neglect of frustration of profiling of a second class feeling in cincinnati white citizens and black citizens for all that time have been pleading for somebody to take a look at what was going on there to respond that didnt happen all of this just bubbled over but not because of this one incident because of a number of incidents like this over the years
7455164 growing national proclivity for avoiding even the discussion of race but by shunning racial issues and ignoring history including fairly recent history we make americas most intractable problem that much more difficult to solve

7455166 college graduates choose relationships with other college graduates and therefore worship with college graduates regardless of race
7455167 a truly integrated church will be one with multiple classes followed by multiple races
7455168 choosing relationships across class lines will change the racial makeup of our wedding photos prom pictures vacation photos and class pictures to a socio economic kaleidoscope reflecting people from every tribe nation and tongue
7455169 race is not the churchs biggest problem our biggest problem is loving and befriending people who are not like us weekly meetings conferences and programs have failed because they are too simplistic now is the time for the church to demonstrate radical relationships of inconvenience

7455173 when discussions of race come up do we find ourselves unconsciously identifying ourselves as one race and either being defensive offensive toward the other group or do we identify ourselves as followers of christ and attempt not to justify either side but to look at the issue objectively as an outsider
7455174 my point in writing this post was to expose the disparity of perceptions of race between white and black people
7455175 white people think about race when its convenient or novel or when theyre faced with a situation such as you described when approaching a black man on the street

7455214 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7455215 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

7455219 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7455220 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7455221 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7455222 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7455223 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7455224 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere

7455229 pemerintah harus melihat kenyataannya lagi seperti tahun tahun sebelumnya data yang ada kadang tidak sesuai fakta yang ada
7455230 kita ingat kenaikan harga bbm mei 2008 berkisar antara 30 persen kenaikan harga bbm yang meroket tersebut benar benar mengguncang perekonomian indonesia
7455231 perima blt terdiri dari keluarga sangat miskin miskin dan hampir miskin jika diasumsikan secara konservatif 33 persen penerima blt adalah keluarga hampir miskin dan tidak diperhitungkan masih terdapat 12 8 juta keluarga miskin dan sangat miskin jumlah 12 8 juta keluarga itu dengan asumsi tiap keluarga terdiri atas empat orang suami istri dan dua anak setara dengan 51 2 juta penduduk atau sekitar 23 persen dari total jumlah penduduk indonesia 220 juta jiwa
7455232 data yang digunakan adalah data asal bapak senang abs karena angka kemiskinan turun tapi masyarakat banyak yang menjerit data pengangguran juga demikian
7455233 mungkin nantinya pemerintah bertanya anda punya tidak angka pembanding ya jelas tidak sanggup karena untuk melakukan survei kemiskinan itu butuh biaya yang besar saya harap presiden yang akan datang bisa membuat bps bisa lebih independen
7455234 kemiskinan yang terjadi di indonesia adalah kemiskinan struktural kemiskinan struktural itu terjadi karena kebijakan pemerintah tidak memihak kepada rakyat
7455235 grafik atau tren kemiskinan turun terus angka kemiskinan 2008 baik persentase atau nominalnya adalah angka terendah 10 tahun terakhir baik nominal maupun persentasenya merupakan angka terendah

7455243 tidak perlu repot repot mencari buktinya karena semua itu sangat mudah ditemukan silakan buka dan baca anggaran dasarnya di sana jelas disebutkan bahwa anggota ahmadiyah bertugas menyebarluaskan ajaran pemimpin tertingginya mirza ghulam ahmad
7455244 sby tidak boleh main main dalam persoalan ini karena berbahaya
7455245 mereka adalah pembela islam yang berada di garis terdepan dalam perjuangan membubarkan ahmadiyah
7455246 saya menghormati adnan buyung sebagai ahli hukum tapi dia tidak mengerti sama sekali persoalan ahmadiyah ini
7455247 mahkamah konstitusi sebenarnya tidak senang jika harus membubarkan partai oleh karena itu hashiem meminta kepada para politisi dan legislator untuk melakukan perubahan konstitusi agar legalitas hukum pembubaran suatu parpol tidak diputuskan oleh mahkamah konstitusi
7455248 kami akan buktikan bahwa partai akp tidak akan pernah menjadi pusat kegiatan melawan sekularisme di turki seperti dituduhkan oleh jaksa penuntut umum
7455249 ini didasarkan pada bukti yang disampaikan oleh individu sendiri serta laporan dari pihak ketiga

7455427 it will be a challenge for peter this week especially with the way the crowd reacted to him
7455428 but it will also show his character as a person and coach we will see if he is strong enough to handle it because this is the most difficult rugby job in the world
7455429 peter must understand that with south african rugby it is difficult to move away from the winning principle
7455430 whatever he is trying to do with the team winning still needs to be a priority were behind him and i ask people to have patience and to support the side
7455431 the buck stops with me and my administration it is our responsibility and we need to back him
7455432 the laws of the game have changed and we couldnt be fast asleep
7455433 were just not changing quick enough and we saw in the super 14 we cant win games under the new laws if we dont have speed
7455434 the game is much more intense under the new laws and players need to make decisions quicker on the field
7455435 i believe we are on the right track and the players believe it as well we just have to get used to it we do a lot of things right but we are sometimes just that part of a second too late and there is that one pass that doesnt stick or go outside
7455436 it is understandable the boks have been playing a certain way for years and were trying to change it suddenly we have to be patient
7455437 im not unhappy with the way we are playing but it bothers me a lot that we are not accurate enough on the field
7455438 it is a difficult thing for us to adapt to in the past when things didnt work out for us we would revert back to the drive but with the new laws the drives are sacked and now we have nothing to go back to if things dont work

7455458 there are two big hidden costs to the new iphones faster speed and lower price tag first in my tests the iphone 3gs battery was drained much more quickly in a typical day of use than the battery on the original iphone due to the higher power demands of 3g networks this is an especially significant problem because unlike most other smart phones the iphone has a sealed battery that cant be replaced with a spare second apples exclusive carrier in the u s at amp t inc t has effectively negated the iphones up front price cut by jacking up its monthly fee for unlimited data use by 10 over the course of the two year contract you must sign to get the lower hardware prices that adds 240 overwhelming the 200 savings on the phone itself if you want text messaging the cost rises further with the first iphone 200 text messages a month came free now 200 messages will cost 5 a month or another 120 over the two year contract in daily use i found the battery indicator on the new 3g model slipping below 20 by early afternoon or midafternoon on some days and it entirely ran out of juice on one day i overcame this problem by learning to use wi fi instead of 3g whenever possible turning down the screen brightness and even turning off 3g altogether which the phone permits the iphone 3gs battery life is comparable to or better than that of some other 3g competitors but they have replaceable batteries the iphone doesnt bottom line if youve been waiting to buy an iphone until it dropped in price or ran on faster cell networks you might want to take the plunge if you can live with the higher service costs and the weaker battery life the same goes for those with existing iphones who love the device but crave faster cellular data speeds but if you already own an iphone and can usually use wi fi for data you probably should hold off and get the free software upgrade before deciding whether its worth getting the new hardware

7455466 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7455467 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7455468 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s

7455540 bahwa mereka berdua tengah menyantap makanan dipemanggangan lalu muadzdzin hendak meng iqamahi shalat maka ibnu abbas berkata kepadanya janganlah
7455541 tidak sempurna shalat disaat makanan telah dihidangkan dan tidak sempurna jikalah seseorang dalam keadaan menahan kencing dan hajat besar
7455542 sabda nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam da janganlah seseorang tergesa gesa hingga menyelesaikan makannya adalah dalil yang menunjukkan bahwa dia makan menyelesaikan kebutuhannya dengan menyempurnakan makannya dan inilah pendapat yang shahih adapun penafsiran sebagian dari ulama bahwa dia cukup makan sesuap untuk mengatasi rasa laparnya yang amat sangat bukanlah pendapat yang shahih dan hadits ini sangat jelas menolaknya
7455543 diantara bentuk pemahaman seseorang adalah dengan menyelesaikan hajatnya hingga dia menuju shalat dengan hati yang tenang
7455544 hadits tentang membasuh kedua tangan setelah makan hadits yang hasan dan tidaklah shahih hadits tentang membasuh kedua tangan sebelum makan 24
7455545 dan kami tidak mengetahui seorangpun yang beranggapan sunnahnya berwudhu sebelum makan kecuali apabila dia dalam keadaan junub
7455546 sabda beliau membasuh kedua tangan yaitu terkadang beliau mencukupkannya dengan hal itu untuk menerangkan pembolehan dan terkadang beliau berwudhu
7455547 mencantumkan hadits ini pada tiga judul bab yaitu pertama wudhu seorang yang junub apabila hendak makan kedua seorang yang junub mencukupkan dengan membasuh kedua tangan apabila hendak makan ketiga seorang yang junub mencukupkan mencuci kedua tangan apabila hendak makan
7455548 apabila butiran makanan seseorang diantara kalian terjatuh hendaknya dia mengambilnya lalu membersihkan kotoran yang menempel kemudian memakannya dan jangan dia membiarkannya sebagai makanan syaithan al hadits
7455549 sesungguhnya syaithan ikut menghadiri makanannya maka apabila salah seorang diantara kalian terjatuh makanannya maka hendaknya dia membersihkan kotoran yang menempel padanya kemudian
7455550 adapun hukum hadits tersebut bahwa hukum ini berlaku pada jamaah beberapa orang dan kebiasaan yang berlaku adalah mengambil kurma satu persatu apabila seseorang mengambil bersamaan
7455551 yang benar perlu diperinci apabila makan tersebut mereka diantara mereka bersamaan maka mengambil lebih dari satu bersamaan hukumnya haram kecuali jikalau mereka meridhainya dan ini dengan dapat dengan pernyataan mereka yang jelas atau yang sederajat dengan pernyataan tersebut baik berupa indikasi keadaan atau isyarat dari mereka semuanya dimana dapat diketahui dengan pasti atau dengan persangkaan yang kuat bahwa meeka meridhainya
7455552 apabila kami hadir bersama dengan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7455553 saat itu saya seoranganak keil yang berada didalam kamar rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan tanganku meraih yang ada didalam piring maka rasulullahshallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda wahai anak kecil bacalah bismillah dan makanlah dengan tangan kananmu dan makanlah yang terdekat denganmu maka hal itu menjadi makananku berikutnya
7455554 saya tidak melihat adanya dalil khusus yang menguatkan pernyataan beliau
7455555 wahai anak kecil apabila engkau makan maka sebutlah bismillah makanlah dengan tangan kanamu dan makanlah yang terdekat denganmu
7455556 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian makan hendaknya dia menyebut bismillah taala
7455557 sesungguhnya allah meridhai seorang hamba yang ketka makan suatu makanan lalu dia mengucapkan alhamdulillah
7455558 alhamdulillah katsiran mubarakan fihi ghairi makfiyyiin wa laa muwaddain wa laa mustaghnan anhu rabbana
7455559 alhamdulillah alladzi kafaanaa wa arwaanaa ghaira makfiyyin wa laa makfuurin
7455560 alhamdulillah katsiran mubarakan fihi ghairi makfiyyiin wa laa muwaddain wa laa mustaghnan anhu rabbana
7455561 alhamdulillah alladzi athamaniy hadza wa razaqniihi min ghairi haulin minni walaa quwwatin
7455562 barang siapa yang makan suatu makanan kemudian dia mengucakan alhamdulillah alladzi athamaniy hadza wa razaqniihi min ghairi haulin minni walaa quwwatin segala dosanya yang telah lampau akan diampuni
7455563 alhamdulilah alladzi athama wa saqaa wa sawwaghahu wa jaala lahu makhrajan
7455564 allahumma athamtu wa asqaitu wa aqnaitu wa hadaitu wa ahbabtu falillailhamdu ala maa athaitu
7455565 allahummah athamtu wa asqaituwa aqnaitu wa hadaitu wa ahyaitu falillahilhamdu ala maa athaitu
7455566 wahai anak kecil makanlah dengan menyebut bismillah makanlah dengan tangan kananmu dan makanlah makanan yang terdekat denganmu
7455567 janganlah kalian makan dengan mempergunakan tangan kirimu karena sesungguhnya syaithan makan dengan mempergunakan tangan kirinya
7455568 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian makan hendaknya dia makan dengan mempergunakan tangan kanannya dan apabila minum hendaknya dengan mempergunakan tangan kanannya
7455569 ketika tangan kiri dijadikan untuk ber istinja dan menyentuh hal hal yang najis sementara tangan kanan untuk mengambil makanan maka tidaklah shahih salah satu dari keduanya dipergunakan pada pekerjaan tangan yang lainnya dikarenakan ini merupakan perendahan suatu yang memiliki kedudukan serta meninggikan suatu yang direndahkan kedudukannya
7455570 pada hadits ini menunjukkan bolehnya seseorang mendoakan siapa saja yangmenyalahi hukum syara tanpa adanya udzur
7455571 bahwa al maraq al idam dan makanan lainnya apabila terdiri atas dua jenis atau banyak maka tidak mengapa menjulurkan tangan untuk mengambilnya karena bolehnya memilih makanan yang dihidangkan di meja makan kemudian beliau berkata mengomentari sabda beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7455572 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian makan suatu makanan maka janganlah dia makan pada bagian atasnya akan tetapi hendaknya dia makan pada bagian pinggirnya karena sesungguhnya berkah turun dari bagian atasnya
7455573 makanlah kalian pada bagian pinggir piring dan janganlah kalian makan dari bagian tengahnya karena berkah turun pada
7455574 dikarenakan makan dengan satu atau dau jari tidaklah menjadikan seorang yang makan menikmatinya dan tidak juga memuaskannya dan tidak mengenyangkannya kecuali setelah lama berselang dan juga tidak mengenakkan organ mulut dan pencernaan dengan yang masuk kedalamnya dari setiap makanan sedangkan makan dengan jari dan telapak tangan akan menyebabkan makan memenuhi organ mulut dan juga pencernaan
7455575 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian makan maka janganlah dia membasuh tangannya hingga dia menjilatnya atau dijilatkan kepada orang lain
7455576 janganlah dia mengelap tangannya dengan kain lap hingga dia menjilatnya atau dijilatkan kepada orang lain
7455577 sedangkan al qadiid adalah daging hr abu daud 3772 lafaadz hadits diatas adalah lafazh pada riwayat abu daud ahmad 2435 at tirmidzi 1805 dan beliau berkata hadits ini hadits hasan shahih ibnu majah 3277 dan ad darimi 2046 syarh muslim jilid 7 13 172

7455580 we view illegal immigrants as one of many possible security threats to our installations and respond accordingly
7455581 it is critical to ices homeland security mission to know who enters sensitive areas like airports military bases and power plants to ensure the integrity of these key assets
7455582 in virginia we have been kind of the model for successfully prosecuting illegal immigrants
7455583 we are very aggressive when it comes to protecting the installation
7455584 we put that out clearly that fort lee will not be tolerating illegal immigrants working on post
7455585 it is a big deal from the standpoint that we have to stop work
7455586 unfortunately you have an individual who is hired to do work who is not aware of where the work is being done they dont know that identification will be checked
7455587 virginias construction industry is dependent on a large force of immigrants both documented and undocumented
7455588 the crime here is that congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform
7455589 its sad its tough but unfortunately weve got a job to do we need to protect this installation
7455590 we realize that when you are breaking the law you are breaking the law and we are not at all going to play favorites to anyone
7455591 weve experienced a taste of reality in conversation with cetaceans in the future we may be able to exchange greetings with them
7455592 when are you going to stop hunting my fellow whales as everybody knows are utter claptrap
7455593 certi che la nostra identit possa dare un contributo importante al cambiamento in atto in italia
7455594 il sondaggio odierno del corriere della sera spiega che di fronte al prevedibile aumento di consensi al pdl non un elettore de la destra si ritrova nelle politiche di governo
7455595 nellunico movimento che rappresenta i valori in cui ho sempre creduto e che con la confluenza di an nel pdl rischiavano di restare senza rappresentanza
7455596 ci stiamo tesserando siccome ci sar un congresso nazionale con la tessera potremo dire la nostra
7455597 a volte i nostri amici della lega per motivi anche territoriali sono un po folcloristici ma poi la pensano come noi
7455598 episodio che molto spiaciuto a me e credo a tutti o quasi
7455599 ma per me non cambia niente io la penso come sempre per questi non li capisco in fondo io ho sempre solo votato senza mai espormi da missino ho pensato alla professione ma qui c gente che stata perseguitata ha preso le botte perso il posto ma come fanno
7455600 se si vogliono solo enunciare motti recitare preci e distribuire al volgo slogan ci si emargina o si fa solo i sacerdoti di una fede
7455601 il cambio cercheran di farlo presto giugno luglio del 2008
7455602 dov finita questa coerenza acclamata a gran voce solo pochi mesi fa
7455603 il comitato centrale preso atto dei dibattiti svoltisi nelle assemblee interregionali e in quella nazionale delibera di intraprendere un percorso politico che affianchi contribuendo con proposte costruttive il popolo della libert a tal fine preannuncia la convocazione del congresso nazionale che discuta e vari la nuova linea politica del msi fiamma tricolore certi che la nostra identit possa dare un contributo importante al cambiamento in atto in italia si demanda quindi al prossimo comitato centrale di settembre la nomina della segreteria generale del congresso
7455604 il movimento sociale fiamma tricolore unorganizzazione politica ispirata ad una concezione spirituale della vita che ha il fine di garantire la dignit e gli interessi del popolo italiano nella ininterrotta continuit storica delle sue tradizioni di civilt e nella sua prospettiva di una pi vasta missione occidentale europea mediterranea
7455605 che stata e sar come disse qualcuno la pi audace la pi originale la pi mediterranea ed europea delle idee
7455606 non andremo mai nel pdl e naturalmente lo diciamo ai camerati un po ingenui meno che mai nella destra di storace siamo e resteremo fiamma tricolore
7455607 leggere certe affermazioni da parte di un ormai ex dirigente nazionale fanno veramente pensare specialmente quando si al corrente che quello che stai dicendo non e assolutamente vero
7455608 la cosiddetta destra libertaria composta dagli stessi che avevano gi tradito in campagna elettorale lunica novit che a fare compagnia ai traditori la solita nipote assieme a un deputato europeo del partito di berlusconi
7455609 siamo tutti consapevoli delle carenze dorganico delle forze dellordine e non a caso nel nostro passato programma politico si proponeva linnalzamento dei finanziamenti rivolti a tali settori
7455610 veniamo da lontano stessa sorte un solo cuore vecchia fiamma che non muore una nuova libert
7455611 bh io ho fatto a meno del msft per tanti anni se si scioglie riprender a farne a meno mi spiace piuttosto per questi
7455612 ma io credo nel nostro segretario e so che lui pi di tutti noi non vuole la fine della fiamma
7455613 non c un met del rimborso se lo cucca romagnoli a noi restan solo le cambiali da pagare
7455614 non c un del rimborso del 13 aprile ci danno un misero 10 si tengono tutto gli avidi di ld
7455615 abbiamo deciso di seguire buona parte della base della fiamma tricolore che ora ha traslocato nel movimento casa pound italia
7455616 siamo stufi di essere presi in giro da una dirigenza nazionale incopetente arrogantee degna di venire paragonata alla precedente gestione dellonpino rauti
7455617 casa pound italia rappresenta al pieno tutte le nostre aspirazioni ideologiche politiche e per questo intendiamo seguire lesempio avanguardista delle occupazioni non conforme romane ci sentiamo di promettere sin da ora la nascita di un centro libraio non conforme e di una associazione culturale al fine di poter dare vita a progetti sociali e culturali al servizio della cittadinanza a partire dal prossimo ottobre
7455618 la mia idea di politica si fermata il 22 maggio del 1988 il giorno in cui si sono svolti i funerali del segretario almirante e che coincide con linizio dellestinzione della comunit missina
7455619 dopo aver considerato gli avvenimenti e i cambiamenti avvenuti negli ultimi mesi a livello nazionale
7455620 si effettivamente a far certe porcherie eandare in giro come nulla fosse ci vuole un bel coraggio
7455621 ricordo bene il nostro ultimo incontro e il mio commiato allora
7455622 ho molte pi speranze di vedere sulla scheda marrone delle europee la goccia tricolore del msft che non la torcia di ld
7455623 nel 2008 noi avevamo lesonero romagnoli no ma lo abbiamo accolto in lista ora a parti inverse lui ingrato non ricambia alle provinciali di milano abbiam raccolto le firme ed ecco il simbolo
7455624 se rifiutiamo di inserire in lista una santanch che si frega il seggio ma almeno porta mezzo milione di voti figuriamoci se tirar dentro chi selo frega portandone solo centomila
7455625 qual pena irrogare in campo de fiori o altrove al federale di roma credo che non troverei il tempo di intervenire
7455626 prender virilmente atto dellinsuccesso o mancato successo e scioglierci nel pdl o altrove
7455627 ci vediamo al congresso e chi ha pi numeri vincer
7455628 i vecchi missini da an non possono certo accettare tali affermazioni lo metteranno in minoranza
7455629 anche nella nostra citt dichiara lo stesso putort abbiamo dato vita al progetto
7455630 casapound italia crotone nasce con lintento continua angelo putort di scuotere le coscienze mummificate della societ di combattere lusura e il carovita per il diritto alla propriet della casa con il mutuo sociale per la rinascita di una patria forte e libera dai vincoli posti dai

7455632 nel 1975 facevo parte del gruppo giovanile sezione msi via erasmogattamelata prenestino roma
7455633 non ci riconosciamo pi nel cosiddetto pdl e aderiamo in massa a la destra di francesco storace che da solo sta combattendo contro il sistema dei vecchi partiti
7455634 lauspicio spiega marino rampichetti ex presidente del circolo di an
7455635 noi non saremo protervi come voi si fa a mezzo il rimborso 50 ed eran gi 5 6 milioni ciascuno la sopravvivenza assicurata ed i seggi se son due uno ld uno e msft se son di pi evvva e vinca il migliore
7455636 alessandra si accasata come tu dici ma lasciatelo dire da chi la conosce le sue decisioni durano lespace dun matin ricordi
7455637 1 scarso uno 0 6 0 7 circa storace un altro 1 circa santanch
7455638 e che ci sciogliamo solo perch girata la voce che forse mettono lo sbarramento al 5
7455639 ancora una volta daniela santanch mostra coerenza e capacit di immaginare un percorso politico che dia lopportunit a militanti ed elettori di destra di dialogare con il popolo della libert che oggi rappresenta il principale interlocutore del quadro politico istituzionale
7455640 e ormai inprocastinabile oltre la convocazione dellesecutivo politico nazionale e lo chieder io stesso oggi al segretario nazionale storace per chiarire le affermazioni della nostra portavoce santanche pubblicate oggi sui quotidiani nazionali
7455641 metti tre fascisti in una stanza e dopo una settimana avranno fondato quattro partiti
7455642 mentre quella allinterno della ft la vedo ormai di retroguardia
7455643 oltre alle petizioni on line lanciate nelle scorse settimane vogliamo dare un segno tangibile della nostra presenza a sostegno del popolo tibetano richiamando a roma centinaia di giovani ad affermarlo stefano savoca vice portavoce regionale del movimento giovanile di la destra che fa capo a francesco storace e a teodoro buontempo non guardare in tv le olimpiadi significher disapprovare la quotidiana violazione di diritti umani perpetrata ai danni di questo popolo come di tutti i popoli oppressi
7455644 c stata fumata bianca si va ha spiegato verso un pdl equilibrato e coeso
7455645 an ha il 30 di rappresentanti mentre forza italia il 70 che include per anche i partiti minori in modo da realizzare velocemente questo percorso
7455646 nel percorso verso la nascita del pdl fermo restando quanto stabilito nel documento di intesa tra berlusconi e fini di febbraio 2008 in un incontro con il presidente berlusconi il ministro la russa e lonorevole verdini al quale stato invitato anche il segretario della dca gianfranco rotondi si proceduto a definire un comitato costituente del pdl che oltre ai promotori an e fi vedr la partecipazione di tutti i soggetti che hanno gi dato vita a liste comuni a camera e senato
7455647 in particolare scritto nella nota nellorganismo presieduto da verdini e la russa in cui an sar rappresentata al 30 dei partecipanti saranno rappresentate oltre ovviamente a forza italia tutte le formazioni politiche che gi fanno parte dei gruppi parlamentari comuni del pdl e stata fissata per il 10 settembre la riunione del comitato costituente a roma mentre per il 18 agosto la prima riunione della commissione statuto che dovr redigere la bozza di regole comuni del pdl
7455648 il voto conferito a un partito utile quando viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito inutile quando non viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito dannoso quando viene utilizzato per il fine opposto a quello per il quale stato conferito votare per il mio partito utile perch il mio partito chiede voti per lopposizione a tutti i livelli e li utilizza per lopposizione a tutti i livelli lei da buon democratico mi insegna che in democrazia lopposizione tanto importante quanto il governo a condizione che si tratti di una vera opposizione e non di una sceneggiata come quella che in questo momento recitano le false opposizioni che dicono di combattere il governo e i partiti di governo ma la tempo stesso lottizzano con il governo e i partiti di governo le posizioni di potere quanto al frigorifero noi manteniamo intatti i voti che riceviamo perch li utilizziamo con fedelt e coerenza e non ce ne serviamo per baratti di alcun genere
7455649 io penso e affermo che fuori dalla vera legittimit costituzionale si pongono quei partiti che rifiutano di attivare gli articoli sociali della costituzione 39 40 e 46 che interpretano in maniera distorta larticolo 49 e dal pluralismo fanno nascere il mostro che si chiama partitocrazia penso e affermo che fuori della costituzione siano quei partiti che lottizzano in termini di potere e quindi di arbitrio la libert di informazione attraverso il mezzo radio televisivo le chiedo anche se abbia avuto modo di conoscere i lineamenti del sistema da noi posto in alternativa presidente della repubblica eletto direttamente dal popolo presidente del consiglio e ministri nominati dal presidente della repubblica senza forcipe di partiti e senza manuali cencelli parlamento eletto direttamente e pluralisticamente ma con la partecipazione di rappresentanze elette delle categorie del mondo del lavoro della produzione della tecnica della cultura e dellarte tutto questo solo idealismo se fosse ne sarei orgoglioso ma io sono fiero di ben altro isolato nei confronti di un paese legale sempre pi lontano dal paese reale ho lorgoglio di essere sempre pi vicino alle esigenze alle speranze e quindi alla comprensione del paese reale cio del popolo italiano
7455650 che strana domanda dottor montanelli ma come pu saltarle in mente visto che lei un uomo che crede nella libert che il segretario di un partito possa dissolvere il suo partito e possa addirittura dopo averlo dissolto farne confluire i voti in altre direzioni centinaia di migliaia di iscritti e almeno due milioni di elettori ma in questo momento siamo di pi dovrebbero obbedire al dittatore almirante per accettare da un momento allaltro di dissolversi e poi di confluire dissolversi cio scomparire come fatto politico come fatto di coscienza come fatto morale come fatto di impegno fisico e spirituale confluire cio abbracciare unaltra fede unaltra dottrina un altro e molto diverso credo politico rinnegando dun colpo se stessi
7455651 non sentiamo il bisogno di ripudiare il nostro passato consapevoli di aver certamente errori da rimpiangere ma non delitti o tradimenti di cui vergognarci
7455652 gli altri camerati che solo a vederlo si spostavano io ho avuto la possiblit di fissarlo negli occhi per un istante ha dovuto abbassare lo sguardo anche perch accanto a me c era una grande persona che a lui non va proprio a genio se quel grande camerata ci legge
7455653 eccoti la quota iscrivimi per il 2009 se c non voglio rischiare di trovarmi berlusconiano a tradimento
7455654 la lista la facciamo ovunque seriamente possibile e con una fiamma che rappresenti tutti o gi di l
7455655 che fa storace a novembre che fa romagnoli a gennaio che fa berlusconi a febbraio come sar la legge europea
7455656 in unintervista al corriere sul numero odierno del responsabile di cpi firenze che dichiara di voler candidare alla carica di sindaco di firenze massimiliano bartolozzi e di voler cercare intese ed alleanze con alleanza nazionale e con la destra
7455657 sei come un piatto leggero salmone aragosta maionese e verdure con intorno tante spezie
7455658 un uomo che vive con te ha capito tutto della vita
7455659 meglio loro che distruggono la casa del grande fratello che i clienti del billionaire
7455660 quello che avrai nella bocca non sar pi la famosa bava ma altro
7455661 quelle frasi sono sul blog di storace si commentano da sole io ho preso un milione di voti se anche fossero mille non rappresentano tutti storace il presidente della commissione roma capitale io in questo momento non sono nessuno non ho bisogno di ruolo io esisto comunque
7455662 quelli che incontro io mi dicono di andare avanti non sono mai uscita dal partito andr al congresso e chieder che la mia linea sia votata il partito non una caserma sono certa di vincere
7455663 non lascio nessuno n storace n il partito non un tradimento un progetto politico
7455664 gli elettori hanno voluto il bipartitismo il pdl il partito del centrodestra io sono una donna di destra il mio futuro l
7455665 lespressione sempre di attualit solo che visto il caldo la cambierei in palle di lino
7455666 berlusconi ha sempre utilizzato le donne come il predellino della sua mercedes un punto dappoggio per sembrare pi alto dei veri nanetti di cui si circonda
7455667 berlusconi vede noi donne sempre in posizione orizzontale e mai verticale
7455668 ragazzi ma dove vivete la politica si fa cos giorno per giorno con la testa voltata allindietro non si va da nessuna parte
7455669 chi fa politica non tenuto allillibatezza questa virt di stato mi ripugna mi ricorda lunione sovietica il comunismo rischiamo tutti di essere spiati dal grande fratello denuncio una magistratura politicizzata che usa le intercettazioni per colpire i suoi nemici politici e la faziosit di personaggi come il dottor furio colombo che ha sempre esaltato la moralit di gianni agnelli e su berlusconi usa il linguaggio scamiciato di di pietro volevano colpire il re seduttore sotto la cintola ma non ce lhanno fatta
7455670 in questa sporca guerra sono le vittime sono le streghe di salem non ho visto nessuna femminista difendere le donne ferite nella loro dignit nessuna ha preso le distanze da quella manifestazione di piazza navona che ha decretato la fine della sinistra dalla guzzanti una che festeggiava il cancro della fallaci
7455671 sono contraria a un bambino servono un pap e una mamma non due pap o due mamme
7455672 la vita un bene non disponibile per gli esseri umani
7455673 tifo mccain uno che ha fatto la guerra in vietnam solido combattente obama hollywood come il pd tutto annunci proclami lento non rock
7455674 come appare nelle foto con lombrellone sotto braccio aveva detto che sarebbe andato in africa e ha portato lafrica in italia
7455675 lo ringrazio per il film ma la sua una proposta non ricevibile mi spiace deluderlo il mio piatto preferito pane e salame
7455676 vi proponiamo lintervista a francesco storace pubblicata oggi dal quotidiano la stampa
7455677 fini aveva svenduto an gi prima quando ha deciso di chiudere i battenti con la destra politica organizzata
7455678 berlusconi e veltroni hanno deciso come deve essere il parlamento italiano
7455679 un presidente in galera un facente funzioni che gioca a nascondino con la data delle elezioni il centrodestra incapace di parlare con chiarezza stamane ho detto al nostro portavoce regionale luigi deramo di preparare il partito ad affrontare una campagna elettorale nel nome del cambiamento morale
7455680 la situazione abruzzese sta precipitando nella farsa un presidente in galera un facente funzioni che gioca a nascondino con la data delle elezioni il centrodestra incapace di parlare con chiarezza stamane ho detto al nostro portavoce regionale luigi deramo di preparare il partito ad affrontare una campagna elettorale nel nome del cambiamento morale e sotto la bandiera di teodoro buontempo
7455681 dora in avanti si tiene duro e boia chi molla a cominciare dallabruzzo
7455682 sia giusto partecipare alla costruzione del pdl evitando lautoghettizzazione di un partito che non pu ridursi a un semplice comitato valido solo per recuperare rimborsi elettorali
7455683 il movimento che ha recentemente fatto parlare di s nella citt di jacopone avendo inglobato gran parte dei fuoriusciti dalla locale fiamma tricolore evidenzia cristiano coccanari ha deciso cos alle soglie della ripresa autunnale dellattivit politica di mettere in campo un evento politico e ludico che possa presentare nel modo migliore lassociazione agli abitanti del territorio e non solo
7455684 e graditissima la presenza viene sottolineato in un comunicato di tutti coloro che vogliano saperne di pi sullassociazione che tra le altre cose si messa in evidenza con la proposta del mutuo sociale che ha avuto risonanza anche nella citt di todi con una richiesta ufficiale di istituzione presso il consiglio comunale
7455685 se berlusconi vuole aprire il dialogo sa come fare se invece di alleanze pensa di decidere chi deve fare il segretario de la destra allora siamo al cannibalismo
7455686 innanzitutto dice storace io non ho chiesto niente a nessuno poi se cicchitto vuol fare un bel convegno di carattere storico non mi sentira dire mai che a ventotene si andava per turismo o altre amenita che ho ascoltato dal suo presidente berlusconi
7455687 chieda al premier perche non ha mai voluto festeggiare il 25 aprile al contrario di altri
7455688 noi vi aiutiamo ma a condizione che sosteniate solo cpi
7455689 gia ci aiutate poco per carenza di mezzi strutture etc
7455690 essere di destra significa in primo luogo riconoscere il carattere sovvertitore dei movimenti scaturiti dalla rivoluzione francese siano essi il liberismo o la democrazia o il socialismo
7455691 la destra non sarebbe una ideologia un partito e neppure unideologia politica essa semplicemente la maggioranza dei cittadini che desiderano che i treni arrivino in orario che le balie allattino i bambini che i becchini seppelliscano i morti senza scioperi contestazioni e altre cause di perturbazione dellordine pubblico
7455692 la destra slancio vitale volont di potenza spiritualismo laico estetica della politica saldezza morale lealt onore fedelt alla parola data coerenza con i propri ideali amore verso il proprio popolo capacit di sacrificio
7455693 questa italia non ci piace e forse neppure ci appartiene ma pur sempre la nostra madre e la dobbiamo amare comunque anche se diventata una prostituta
7455694 la battaglia di questo appuntamento non quella di stabilire le capacit laffidabilit e lortodossia della santanch ma quella di contribuire a salvaguardare unidentit di utilizzare il proprio voto per preservare una memoria di combattere per non far archiviare maldestramente una storia poi arriver anche il tempo delle verifiche e degli esami

7455745 we have to be honest about our interpretations everybodys interpretation is essentially his or her own opinion nobody is objective
7455746 all things in scripture are not alike plain in themselves nor alike clear unto all yet those things which are necessary to be known believed and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of scripture or other that not only the learned but the unlearned in a due use of the ordinary means may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them
7455747 strong postmoderns keep focusing on the differences in order to drive us to the conclusion that we are not really finding pauls meaning at all but merely the interpreters meaning this is really one more example of that manipulative antithesis unless you can understand pauls letter to the romans omnisciently you cannot really understand it at all except in the subjective sense the your understanding of it is a function of your social setting nothing more yet there is improvement in understanding paul given time and re reading some elements of pauls thought we can know even if we know none of it perfectly
7455748 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them for his invisible attributes namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made so they are without excuse for although they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things

7455755 washington reuters president george w bush on tuesday vetoed legislation that would have cut medicare reimbursements to insurers and blocked a scheduled pay cut for doctors who treat patients under the governments health program for the elderly

7455760 in a further concession to the impact of the childhood obesity epidemic in the united states a leading group of pediatricians is recommending that kids as young as 8 years old be given cholesterol lowering drugs in hopes of preventing heart problems later in life the american academy of pediatrics also recommends that children as young as 2 years old start having their cholesterol levels screened if they have a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol screening should start no later than 10 the academy said dr steven p shelov chairman of pediatrics at maimonides medical center and head of maimonides infants amp childrens hospital in new york city said he agreed with the new guidelines more aggressive screening is a good idea and the use of cholesterol lowering statins at relatively low doses will keep cholesterol at safer ranges the academy is also recommending that children whose family history of cholesterol is not known or who have risk factors for heart disease including obesity high blood pressure or diabetes have their cholesterol tested the recommendations were published in the july issue of the journalpediatrics according to the recommendation the best method for checking cholesterol is a fasting blood test children whose cholesterol is normal should have the test repeated every three to five years for those children older than 8 who have high levels of ldl bad cholesterol doctors should consider giving them statins shelov admitted that very little is known about the risks and benefits of using cholesterol lowering drugs like statins in a large pediatric population potentially millions of children could be placed on cholesterol lowering drugs he said at the same time there needs to be a systematic look at the effects of these medications on children because they do have side effects he added if we are going to go ahead and do this were going to need guidelines on exactly who would warrant the therapy and careful measurement of any side effects shelov said its possible that many children who start taking statins would not be on them for life changes in diet and exercise could have some children off the drugs in a relatively short time shelov said
7455761 these drugs are not recommended for women who are pregnant nursing or who may become pregnant
7455762 this is a government that is taking tremendous and frankly awful strides to maintain its power that is increasingly abusing its own citizens and has raised or should i say lowered the bar to a level that we rarely see

7455798 the mailers right to communicate is circumscribed only by an affirmative act of the addressee giving notice that he wishes no further mailings from that mailer to hold less would tend to license a form of trespass and would make hardly more sense than to say that a radio or television viewer may not twist the dial to cut off an offensive or boring communication and thus bar its entering his home nothing in the constitution compels us to listen to or view any unwanted communication whatever its merit we see no basis for according the printed word or pictures a different or more preferred status because they are sent by mail

7455811 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7455812 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7455813 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7455814 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have the right mind set
7455815 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7455816 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team

7455827 its unfortunate but if you wear a suit to a job interview you are more likely to have the job
7455828 but just the change in posture and the way she holds herself from the time she comes in to the time she leaves is amazing

7455834 if he lost he was going to cry hed sit inside and cry
7455835 but winning hed just put that big smile on and thats it
7455836 he wasnt real muscular but he could certainly throw the football and take a hit
7455837 wed scrimmage a little bit and hed make a play and we were like dang
7455838 once we watch the film i get amazed sometimes at how i get away i dont know

7455843 it has been a long pull all of us wish it would be shorter
7455844 mike thought he could escape the pain by creating a diversion from his addiction to adult pornography so he created the cancer scenario
7455845 we fully understand the questions shock disbelief and even anger you may feel but michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help
7455846 as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often break down i would report the cause of my symptoms simply as illnesses but the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but again used a mis diagnosis to hide the lie that i was living
7455847 this news has come as a great shock to everyone including it seems his own wife and family
7455848 michael has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family we are asking our church to pray for the guglielmucci family during this difficult time
7455849 but were waiting on further investigation to find out the full truth
7455850 the church is in shock we were totally unaware of the situation
7455851 itinerate minister who held a credential with the australian christian churches
7455852 the national executive of the acc is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of the medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
7455853 michael guglielmucci has not been a paid staff member of edge church for eight years
7455854 edge church is committed to the truth and honouring the people of our church our history has been one of integrity and openness we love the people of our community who have been actively involved in trying to bring life and hope to the hurting and the needy and will continue to do so
7455855 hope truth and love is not just our motto it is our life mission
7455856 today is a very sad day for our family and church family for many years our son michael has suffered from unexplained illnesses we have been worried as we have seen him suffer and spend periods of time in hospital two years ago our lives were totally turned around by the sad news of our sons cancer diagnosis the love and support shown by our local church and all of our many friends around the world helped us get through a very difficult situation during the last two years we have experienced the favor of god his love and grace and also the constant pain of the possibility of losing a son on tuesday 12th of august we received a call to come and meet with mike and amanda but werent ready for what we were about to hear mike began to share how he has lived a lie for the last 16 years of his life because of addictive behavior he couldnt break free from he loved god and would throw himself into prayer worship and serving god with full energy and enthusiasm but still couldnt break free in september in 2006 mike had an accident and went to hospital it was at this time because of his torment of living a double life mike thought he could escape the pain by creating a diversion from his addiction to adult pornography so he created the cancer scenario the pain of this addiction was so deep that he started something he couldnt stop and proceeded on a downward spiral that led to him experiencing pain and suffering that resulted in constant vomiting and many other symptoms of a genuine sufferer sharonne and i witnessed these episodes and pained and wept over his suffering michael wrote the song healer because he wanted god to set him free from his addiction but hid it behind the lie of a fabricated illness once he had started down this track he felt he couldnt stop so he continued to act out this sickness feeling he had gone too deep into the lie i cant begin to tell you how much this is hurting us on the inside a few weeks ago mike had a dream of jesus on the cross looking down on him saying the truth will set you free and so he decided to confess and bring everything out into the open i immediately contacted our national executive and submitted to their advice and council church our family needs your prayers at this time we are so so sorry to bring you into this i have lead you with openness and integrity and declare that we have not lived a lie before you we fully understand the questions shock disbelief and even anger you may feel over this announcement please pray for us and we will pray for you michael is struggling with a different kind of illness and is receiving professional help and will do so as long as is needed on the council and advice of our executive and board after our up and coming edge conference we will take time to be with mike and get him all the professional and spiritual help he needs to come to full recovery we have an amazing team thank you executive board staff and church for your love and support we will do what is right before god and man and see this situation turned around for the glory of god we love you
7455857 so now these five things must apply to him he must humble himself he must again hunger after god he must be committed to holiness to honour god to honour church and to honour everybody in the community
7455858 he must also have a heart to heal his own brokenness before he can ever reach out to the brokenness of others

7455874 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent

7455876 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7455877 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7455878 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7455879 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7455880 the downward trend now is firmly in place and we will go through those supports

7455883 in the week before his passing yadav had been carefully completing homework involving the study of sea creatures and water and rainfall
7455884 indeed the day after his passing we learned that yadav was to attend the melbourne aquarium on a school excursion
7455885 it therefore appears that tragic circumstances on a cold and wet night conspired to claim yadavs life
7455886 we must hope the story of yadavs brief life eagerness to learn and tragic passing proves as a parable to all people that they should take the time in their hectic lives to thank the good health of their beautiful children and families

7455897 i significati dei dati ocse pisa citati litalia ultima in europa per la qualit della scuola probabilmente ci dipende anche dal fatto che siamo pressoch ultimi per quantit di finanziamenti attribuiti al settore
7455898 spero davvero che il ministro si riferisse alle condizioni di arretratezza delledilizia scolastica del sud perch la preparazione degli insegnanti di primissimo livello
7455899 assai grave afferma lombardo che ci si esprima in questi termini
7455900 al di l delle smentite parlano i fatti i tagli apportati in finanziaria fanno presagire il peggio
7455901 abbiamo la conferma che per questa maggioranza per questo governo litalia non pi una nazione unita ha vinto bossi e gli altri si adeguano
7455902 it was a time i needed a challenge in my life i needed to prove to myself that i was more than just numbers so i did all the training in sf and rode the whole way last year
7455903 its good to see it from the other side now my boyfriends riding and im the roadie next time well get it together
7455904 its an all inclusive package some of these riders are getting the best medical care theyve ever had with the medical team the sports medicine and chiropractor group and the massage team
7455905 ive gotten hit on a number of times sometimes they ask me to give them mouth to mouth
7455906 ive always been a roadie and this year i have a good group
7455907 this is something i can give to the community without feeling so sad and depressed
7455908 thats a juggling act right there but its very rewarding
7455909 its so nice to be appreciated they appreciate me more than my wife of 27 years
7455910 its unique to see such a well organized event that is so big ive never seen anything on this scale
7455911 it has been really amazing to see my friends who are all deputies captains and roadies who have done this event for years to actually see them in action theyre the backbone of the event
7455912 we are setting up this city seven times the government doesnt work this well
7455913 this ride wakes things up in people they begin to realize and release emotions that they didnt know they had but overall i think this event gives people a sense of hope
7455914 we are dealing with people who get vulnerable once they lay down we work to help fix injuries and provide comfort
7455915 this is a week where you can get a sense that its actually possible to get along unfortunately it has to happen for something as heinous as aids everyone here is one degree of separation from someone who died of aids
7455916 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines
7455917 from that its probably not too big a leap to think its probably at least somewhat true across the board
7455918 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change
7455919 to me its a plan that says theyre going to do more planning
7455920 my study plots in california at least indicate theyve continued to plummet and very seriously so
7455921 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7455922 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7455923 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7455924 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7455925 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7455926 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news
7455927 as long as congress is sitting and not doing the peoples bidding then were going to be here
7455928 in general both parties have kept us down this militaristic path and neglected our basic needs
7455929 i dropped this bin on the street and the lid landed in human feces
7455930 sir step away from the truck we have no wipes here
7455931 johnny being as young as he is at this point of the season logging as many innings as he has 155 we want to err on the side of caution take no chances

7455994 then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore pray earnestly to the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
7455995 and he told them many things in parables saying a sower went out to sow
7455996 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is what was sown along the path as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet he has no root in himself but endures for a while and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word immediately he falls away as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it proves unfruitful as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty

7456124 whitney je ziet er depressief uit als je iets dwarszit mag je het mij vertellen behalve als het maar niet een sappig verhaal is
7456125 ja er zit me iets dwars ik heb een ring van een jongen gekregen maar die pas ik niet
7456126 ik zei toch dat het niet van die sappige liefdesverhalen moesten zijn
7456127 het is toch erg dat een 6 inch ring mij niet past maar als beverhoofd het weer niet aankan hou ik al op
7456128 beverhoofd hoe durf je mij zo te noemen ik lijk niet eens op een bever

7456139 as many international analysts will inevitably fall over themselves to fawn over and laud googles mp3 search service from a distance it h as to be recognized that it is far from being a cakewalk for google their partner top 100 still has to convince quite a few more labels and artists to join the service without which users will consider this an incomplete service not worth switching over from baidu
7456140 when a culture is faced with an end it disregards it
7456141 my fundamental premise is that the modernist has only two options consistent with her modernism new god or no god
7456142 our public theism is probably a riot of equivocations in which there are many new god beliefs among the rioters
7456143 merely lost faith in an older and unacceptable notion of god
7456144 god talk may be the only language adequate for the expression of certain emotions
7456145 whatever there is in nature that makes good things possible
7456146 from the god of our fathers to the god of our friends
7456147 mashhadani left al hussein medical centre on sunday night after treatment he was in good health
7456148 up to this point hallmarks brand was pretty wholesome if they dont reconsider this endorsement of immorality theyll lose more customers than they stand to gain
7456149 we hope our efforts to hold them accountable will help them see the light
7456150 however bad things may become evil men only triumph in the most important ways when we let them
7456151 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7456152 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7456153 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7456154 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7456155 but once we were award of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7456156 we felt given the new information we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7456157 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7456158 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7456159 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete

7456164 it was mature and astute shes become her own person call it a coming of age
7456165 the french have been so dominant to stick half a second into them its amazing
7456166 our friendship has been so dominant in the last few years as part of a team you cant let anyone down
7456167 i havent won any international races before but we knew beforehand we could do it
7456168 coach jurgen grobler kept telling us no one could beat us but sometimes it was hard to believe him
7456169 we were on the ropes and we put together the best finish weve ever had
7456170 i had to play it safe i couldnt play silly beggars and go chasing world records
7456171 after the kilo was dropped there were parts of me thinking that it could be the end of my individual career but to come back to win a different event altogether is just fantastic it really is
7456172 our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
7456173 im in a bit of a daze national anthem flag its a dream come true
7456174 to me thats what sport is about its those pressure moments thats what i love about competing
7456175 everyone in sailing knows hes a legend hes so young still and he has yet to do more i wouldnt be surprised if he surpassed sir steve redgrave in my lifetime hes the most special sailor weve seen
7456176 i havent got the reaction that id imagined that id have
7456177 we were just rattling around it was so smooth it felt easy to be honest we knew it was fast but 3 53 314 we just cant believe it thats going to go down in history that time wont be broken in a long time were the best team in the world

7456180 an inspiration to the british cycling team and an inspiration to british sport in general chris hoy for superman yes
7456181 chriss performances at the beijing olympics were simply outstanding and he deserves every recognition i can think of no better way of marking his historic success than by naming scotlands only world class track cycling facility after him
7456182 ive wanted this so badly id beaten everyone in the field so there was a lot pressure on me to win a medal im the golden girl of the track
7456183 im paid to win gold medals lets win em all
7456184 i felt good this morning i knew we could do it i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt its been a killer four years and it feels great to put it behind us
7456185 he was tough horrible and strong throughout the bout but im olympic champion its unbelievable
7456186 the team sprint was hard to watch the guys put in a phenomenal ride it was a shame i couldnt be part of team but im delighted today i cant put it into words
7456187 i believe if we did it again we could do it i want to go back to the start and try again we let it slip away at the end it was 100 from everyone but we didnt quite get it right
7456188 you turn up at the olympics and finish second and you think you know im really very good
7456189 we didnt talk at all out there were best friends we train together and we just kind of knew when to kick at the right time
7456190 im so excited the way he has jumped feels great the horse is really young and im really pleased with him as he has never seen anything like this before
7456191 it was very disappointing not to get the gold extremely disappointing not to get the silver but you never pass up an olympic medal im just delighted
7456192 i didnt come for bronze but im really happy physically i was more ready than i have ever been but mentally i was tired it has been good and the ups and downs are something to remember
7456193 politicians use classical music rather like they use white tie galas and red carpets it adds dignity and intensifies an occasion making it more serious and profound but the music heard at political events is all too often ignored despite its often huge symbolic importance what message is there in gergievs choice of shostakovichs wartime potboiler for an ossetian victory concert
7456194 i wanted to create the image of our embattled country to engrave it in music
7456195 a beautiful future time when the enemy will have been defeated

7456199 every city has had its big twist on the games what they have thats different to every other county
7456200 the olympic movement is about bringing the world together im not sure what that difference will be but im looking forward to seeing what it is and how this city develops
7456201 i did not cry four years ago when i got a bronze medal i told myself when you get gold you can cry i cry for all the hard training in the last 10 years and because people love me
7456202 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7456203 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7456204 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7456205 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy
7456206 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7456207 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7456208 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates
7456209 nicox and pfizer are currently in discussions regarding the rights to pf 03187207 the tested nitric oxide donating treatment to allow its potential continued development and commercialization

7456219 we had a confluence of positive comments that have lifted stocks lifted the dollar and caused commodity prices to come in
7456220 i think what daddy bolt was trying to say is that it is his sons nutrition that is the source of his athletic prowess
7456221 a lot of herbalists will claim that they will make estrogen and progesterone and testosterone but all the chemists say bull ticky
7456222 the claim is there but he would have been better off eating fenugreek
7456223 from start to finish they were just incredible a terrific bunch of guys
7456224 they gave a better feeling of a team it wasnt so much individual talent or individual team
7456225 im elated and im convinced more than ever that the fact we had this team together for three years for the most part was the telling difference in this game
7456226 it was a great game it was a pressure game from the get go and we never cracked
7456227 i think the fact we were together for that period of time was the difference i really do
7456228 i want to play in 2012 but who knows they might want another point guard so im just trying to cherish the moment and remember this for as long as i can
7456229 i think its going to elevate the image of basketball worldwide
7456230 this was maybe one of the great games of all time in olympic history
7456231 foreign minister salah bashir summoned the israeli ambassador this week to officially inform him that jordan rejects such illegal measures
7456232 israel plans excavations near al mughrabi gate of the mosque and wants to build a bridge there violating the 1994 peace treaty with jordan and international treaties
7456233 this would also lead to a new violent conflict in the middle east because jerusalem is a red line for muslims and arabs
7456234 the foreign minister demanded that israel halt any unilateral actions that might affect the status of jerusalem especially the issue of al mughrabi gate
7456235 we have information that jerusalem municipality will take a decision soon to resume work there
7456236 the minister demanded that these countries use their relations with israel to stop it from making unilateral moves in jerusalem that would change the legal status of the holy city including construction work on al mughrabi gate
7456237 having a silver medal is something that i can cherish for the rest of my life the guys were looking strong and i knew i was stronger
7456238 this expenditure was not nugatory because government was obliged to fulfill its obligations to avoid diplomatic embarrassment and to honour the court award
7456239 the chairman advised that the issue of the tanzanian government is a delicate matter because they consider the properties to have been given to them as war compensation for the 1979 and not as a reciprocal arrangement it is therefore inevitable that the government of uganda purchases the properties for the tanzanian government

7456242 ive gone to three olympics now and theyve all been special in their own way
7456243 but i think beijing has just done a superb job of all the little details and my entire team has enjoyed themselves here
7456244 athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marvelled at their ability
7456245 we found it unusual that none of these applications came through with protests
7456246 we have inquired with the authorities who said the protests and the queries of the citizens have been met in mutual agreement

7456259 unfortunate events took place the first time that a jury was empanelled to try the accused mr wood
7456260 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7456261 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7456262 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7456263 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7456264 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial

7456273 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians

7456280 my dad told me that if you become a doctor and you dont help people you dont deserve the title
7456281 the medical school wanted to try a new program by taking a liberal arts student and seeing what kind of doctor theyd make
7456282 it kept me low to the ground made me appreciate people that suffer a lot especially when theyre ill
7456283 its more important to really practice not only medicine but concern and compassion
7456284 he practiced medicine without any thought as to what insurance they had or what walk of life they came from
7456285 that was always his motto he showed me by example that no 1 you dont desert those patients you have to take care of them and no 2 you may not make as much money but youre not going to go broke
7456286 i remember when i was writing my essay to get into medical school and i said that i wanted to go back to my own community and practice medicine and give back to the community the way my parents have
7456287 he could have gone into any other specialty but he wanted to do what uncle henry does
7456288 my parents always told me to be a doctor or dentist
7456289 it has to be something like that especially with immigrants thats how my parents are when i was in college i finally decided i was ready to do something and i went to uncle henrys office to visit one day when i was in town

7456316 mi riferivo ai dati delle indagini ocse pisa sui livelli di apprendimento degli studenti italiani che vengono effettuate ogni due anni e litalia non ne esce bene spiega il ministro i numeri evidenziano con chiarezza che una difficolta maggiore delle scuole del sud rispetto a quelle del nord sia nei livelli di apprendimento relativi alla lettura alle scienze ed alla matematica quindi e la scuola a mancare di una forte progettualita e a registrare nel complesso un gap rispetto al nord ritengo quindi che la scuola del sud vada aiutata a migliorare rispetto ai livelli di apprendimento degli studenti

7456327 this a classic example of a bait and switch three card monte type of ponzi scheme
7456328 manley did everything he was supposed to do now through gross negligence obama has caused great emotional stress to mr scott i am not sure my client could go back to work even if he could find a job
7456329 i could take him being out of work and drinking and getting a little violent
7456330 but when he was not man enough to be the first to know who was obamas running mate i knew our marriage was over
7456331 first he says hell send manley a text message then he changes his mind and doesnt
7456332 this kind of flip flopping is proof obama is not ready to be president
7456333 textgate is a classic example of why obama is not fit to be commander in chief
7456334 when we should be bombing iran he would be fiddling with one of those new fangled cell phones trying to order some arugula

7456336 the nice thing about hosting one of these conventions is that you can show off
7456337 we dont want some traffic jam protest or unfortunate incident to become the big story because theres too much good stuff going on here we have the infrastructure to be prepared to handle anything
7456338 weve always had to overcome this idea that were not big enough or important enough to even be part of the national political landscape

7456383 i was very proud of the game i think it looks amazing but i believe people when they say the game play isnt what it should be and im perfectly sure if theyre saying that there is probably some truth in that to the extent that i can i will try to get it better next time but in the end thats not my area of expertise

7456445 the security situation in pakistan has deteriorated during the year and postponement was the right decision
7456446 we were concerned about the situation in pakistan and felt that if we continued to work through the process put in place by the icc that the right decision would be reached
7456447 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7456448 we appreciate the difficulties that this decision will cause the pakistan cricket board and hope that the champions trophy can be held there in 2009

7456453 that said we have to get ready to play football we werent ready at 3pm i think we started getting ready at 3 30pm
7456454 perhaps people perceived there wasnt much to play for but its a score we would have accepted at 2 55pm

7456458 ill never take them for granted though hopefully well perform and if we do the same as in the previous games i think well get the right result
7456459 ive made it clear that getting off to a good start is important after the two seasons weve had i think people are getting carried away because weve won two games you can easily lose the next two or three
7456460 me and greegs complement each other hes aggressive and likes to attack every ball and i sweep up around him
7456461 i enjoy playing with him and its starting to become a decent partnership we conceded three on the first day but i think that was a freak result and a freak game i think were back to where we were last season before he got injured
7456462 people can say what they want no way will i get carried away although its good looking at the paper when youre top of the league
7456463 weve got off to a great start played three won three but we have 46 games getting carried away well keep our feet on the ground look forward to the next game and try to win that
7456464 i think our performance was very good we had some great opportunities to score more goals but to win 4 0 no matter who youre playing is very pleasing
7456465 i think theyre believing in each other fighting for each other and thats what i want to see
7456466 theyre a good side wed said we were coming up against a team in form and full credit to oldham

7456492 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that

7456537 alumina does not intend to underwrite the drp for the 2008 final dividend

7456551 so if youre weighing up the risks of vaccination versus not vaccination then we would certainly recommend vaccination

7456571 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial

7456591 investing in high quality long life assets is increasingly important to meet the continued growth in demand from our customers and enhance our competitive position
7456592 the entitlement offer will also replace funds that would otherwise have been raised by underwriting the dividend reinvestment plan drp for the 2008 interim dividend
7456593 alumina does not intend to underwrite the drp for the 2008 final dividend
7456594 importantly the structure of the entitlement offer means eligible shareholders have the opportunity to maintain an undiluted interest in alumina
7456595 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces
7456596 it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7456597 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7456598 tergolong mencela makanan bahwa tidak ada pertentangan antara kedua hadits tersebut dan perkataan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7456599 adapun hadits bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ulama berbeda persepsi tentang hukum mnum sambil berdiri
7456600 dan janganlah sekali kali salah seorang diantara kalian minm smabil berdiri barang siapa yang lupa maka hendaknya dia memuntahkannya
7456601 ali radhiallahu anhu datang menuju pintu ar rahbah lalu beliau minum sambil berdiri beliau berkata sesungguhnya beberapa orang tidak menyukai salah seorang diantara mereka minum sambil berdiri dan sesungguhnya saya telah melihat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7456602 kami dizaman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam minum sambil berdiri dan kami makan sambil berjalan
7456603 akan tetapi menyelaraskan hadits haits tersebut dengan menyatakan adanya keringan disaat mempunyai udzur
7456604 qatadah berkata bagaimana dengan makan beliau berkata hal itu lebih buruk dan jelek
7456605 sesungguhnya hal ini akan lebih menghilangkan rasa dahaga lebih menjaga dan lebih bermanfaat
7456606 anas berkata maka saya mengambil nafas tiga kali ketika minum
7456607 sesungguhnya dahaga saya tidaklah hilang hanya dengan sekali mengambil nafas
7456608 syaikh kami didalam syarh at tirmidzi mengatakan sekiranya dibedakan apabila dalam keadaan yang ada udzur seperti misalnya qirbah yang tergantung dan seseorang yang butuh untuk minum tidak mendapatkan wadah dan tidak mampu untuk menjangkau dengan tangannya maka pada keadaan tersebut tidaklah makruh dan kepada keadaan itulah hadits hadits yang telah disebutkan diatas tersebut dipahami
7456609 disenangi bagi seorang yang menuang minuman sebagai orang terakhir yang minum
7456610 makanan untuk seorang cukup untuk dua orang makanan dua orang cukup untuk empat orang dan makanan empat orang cukup untuk delapan orang
7456611 pad riwayat ath thabrani dari hadits ibnu umar berisi tuntunan akan sebab dari hal itu dimana pertamanya
7456612 makanlah kalian semua berjamah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai karena sesungguhnya makanan untuk seseorang akan mencukupi dua orang
7456613 hati hatilah kalian dengan pemenuhan perut kalian karena akan menjadikan malas menuju shalat dan menjadi penyakit bagi tubuh
7456614 lambung adalah telag abagi tubuh dan setiap usus bermuara kepadanya dan darinya
7456615 barang siapa yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir maka janganlah dia duduk di meja yang terhidang khamar diatasnya al hadits
7456616 usually with these things about 60 to 70 interested parties come out of the woodwork and half a dozen might have the capacity to complete a transaction

7456620 at that stage turnbull handed over kennedys notes which detailed what packer was planning
7456621 this was done with some melodrama turnbull said to westerway i fear for myself my family for my career

7456624 we are definitely disappointed by australia because they have not toured us for 10 years
7456625 australia have a commitment of playing five one day internationals in april next year so we hope by then their fears are removed and they play in our country

7456630 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7456631 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7456632 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7456633 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7456634 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial

7456665 in a western and elitist way we have viewed chinas right to its olympic games to its coming out its moment of glory with condescension and concessional tolerance
7456666 the western critic feeling the epicentre of the world changing but not at all liking it seeks to put down these vast societies on the basis that their political and value systems dont match up to theirs
7456667 perhaps the most egregious example of international double dealing of any international regime
7456668 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation

7456704 utah is going into the big house and they have a chance to do something big its going to be a big thing here in utah for everybody to be able to watch and see how utah does
7456705 the tv the attention it gets its great different than playing a conference team for us
7456706 anytime you play such a familiar school one that everybody knows what their helmet is youve got to be ready to play
7456707 the only way you can do that get national recognition is go and win big games
7456708 if byu and utah start fast they will probably be underdogs that is a great way to have this conference say were no longer going to be overlooked that is one way to do it and who knows throw tcu in there as a third team playing oklahoma
7456709 i think northern iowa the more i learn about them the more impressed i am
7456710 no words can really express how i feel right now how the team feels its just a great feeling its something were so proud of
7456711 it will probably go down in history as one of the greatest olympic games ever
7456712 and to be sitting here on top of the world i think we did a hell of a job putting american basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7456713 we had a game plan and they countered our game plan by making some incredible plays every possession counted tonight for all 40 minutes you couldnt take one possession off one second off
7456714 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals but what you saw today was a team a team buying together and facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win

7456721 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7456722 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7456723 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body

7456757 tourists especially americans who came to see where the film was shot were always disappointed when they heard the pub didnt actually exist in real life
7456758 now they will be able to have a drink just like john wayne did in the film or browse the souvenirs
7456759 im really angry they are young 16 to 20 years old
7456760 they are too young i cant believe theyre doing that
7456761 i think this is important if people have a problem just give the money to them
7456762 safety is important i hope everybody has safety in their life
7456763 were feeling positive about these guys getting caught or at least we can make them have second thoughts about doing it again everybodys got to keep supporting each other and not letting these thugs get the upper hand its a major urban city you know crime happens we cant let it stop us from pursuing our livelihoods and make us live in fear thats no way to live im not willing to live that way
7456764 they were pretty uncertain about where to stand where to go what to do
7456765 they werent extremely confident in their actions the impression was that they had this idea maybe saw the news on tv and they thought about it a little bit but havent been at this very long
7456766 a peculiar fact about termite tapeworm fungus moss art is that it goes always forward eating its own boundaries and likely as not leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager industrious unkempt activity

7456772 for me i dont mind partying as long as he doesnt come home really really late
7456773 and i guess another thing for me is i dont like it when people borrow stuff without asking
7456774 im more of a morning person and she was up until the crack of dawn
7456775 i dont think i honestly answered all the questions because i didnt want a psychopath
7456776 so i was like i never party because i didnt want to room with a big partyer
7456777 its just a name they gave themselves theyre nice young people
7456778 in the past two weeks we had largely secured the zone but you have to be frank we were guilty of overconfidence
7456779 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7456780 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7456781 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament

7456786 we miss so many great days and for them to make this day special means a lot
7456787 things were very different then but we were renting properties from anywhere between 1 500 to 100 000
7456788 we really dont have a good sense yet how this ones going to go because its hard to predict how our economy will be
7456789 during the 2000 u s open we rented places in the salinas area too and well probably be doing that again considering all of the hotels and motels will be booked to capacity
7456790 that year a three bedroom two bath home in salinas was renting for around 3 000 to 3 500 for the week
7456791 its good for the owners but its not an easy thing to do
7456792 youre going to have complete strangers in your home and a lot of the time theyre not going to love your home as much as you do what we find is that one of the spouses usually loves the idea the other doesnt the one who doesnt tends to be pretty stressed out the whole time
7456793 one thing about putting your home up as a vacation rental is that somebody could be going through your stuff while youre away
7456794 may magandang naibubunga ito sapagkat pakiramdam ng ibang civil society members at taumbayan ng pampanga na nanganganib ang pinasimulang krusada sa good governance at responsible citizenship because of recall kaya nag bond ngayon itong civil society
7456795 the recall move bonds the civil society members and people of pampanga because they feel the threat on the crusade for good governance and responsible citizenship
7456796 people coming from other perception persuasion paniniwala nila na nagiging hadlang kami sa pagpapa iral ng hindi mabuting pamamalakad they believe we are hindrance to their corrupt ways
7456797 we have cleared no less than 15 communities and camps we have to take note that the camps that that we are referring to are not the conventional camps that we know of in the military these are communities that are populated by the milf warriors themselves the fighters
7456798 so we have cleared no less than 15 of these communities and these are all equipped with fortifications barricades trenches and bunkers which only shows that these are not ordinary civilian barangays or communities but they were converted into fortresses
7456799 while we can occupy or seize camps that is more symbolic than otherwise but what we are running here after are the ones responsible for the atrocities not the lands or not the communities our mission is geared more or directed against the personalities who are responsible the hostilities or the attacks
7456800 we have made some substantial gains in terms not necessarily of gaining ground literally grounds or terrain but the objective is more of running after the groups the members of the groups responsible
7456801 in the last 24 hours we have observed that their resistance had lessened very much lesser than the resistance that we have encountered in the last 48 hours as of now there are sporadic harassments but these are very much lesser than the first two days
7456802 but as i have made it clear even to our directives to our forces anybody who joins the group of umbra kato and bravo definitely will be subjected to the same treatment considering that on the ground for practical reason you cannot distinguish one from the other i think they will be equally liable if they join the group who are considered criminals
7456803 very minimal because we have very specific instructions to not only take due caution but to apply whatever fire support is available for the ground troops before their advance
7456804 the figures that are coming out the 100 earlier revealed i think is not very far from the real score on the ground around a hundred i think that is not very far from what is reality our artillery and our air force assets have been hitting their targets
7456805 our forces on the ground have found out after overrunning some of these positions that our air forces assets have scored direct hits even in machine gun positions and where the group conglomerated there are clear signs of dead and wounded

7456871 viele menschen vers umen das kleine gl ck w hrend sie auf das grosse warten
7456872 ich hatte die trostlose entschuldigung durch meine arbeit frau und kind zu erhalten dass es eine fadenscheinige entschuldigung war wusste ich denn wenn ich morgen tot umfiele w rden sie irgendwie weiterleben warum h rte ich nicht mit allem auf und spielte ichsein
7456873 man wird ausdauernder f r das t tige nach aussen gerichtete dasein wenn man sich von zeit zu zeit ganz in sich selbst zur ckzieht

7456877 the whole thing is under this big shroud of secrecy im used to it now though because heroes is the same way
7456878 it was a really rewarding experience you know challenging and exciting and everyday was something new and the scale of it was pretty epic so we had a really good time jj abrams managed to keep it all about what we had in front of us everyday even though we were in the mist of something sort of huge and life changing and hopefully really impatful it felt like we knew what we had to go do everyday at work so that was cool
7456879 you know its funny because actually in the movie in the climax of the movie when spock actually oh
7456880 ive actually got really good at being cagey and evasive
7456881 this is only my second convention i did one in burbank with leonard nimoy in april i did one in denver too so this is my third you know its great that theres an outlet and that theres a support system and structure in place that gives people that are so enthusiastic about these projects a place to go and channel their energy and channel their enthusiasm i mean as someone whos been part of heroes and now star trek i feel like yeah its really cool and people have been incredibly warm and supportive
7456882 i really feel like this season were returning to that sense of energy that we captured in the first season
7456883 were going to figure this one out and get through it just like we always have in the past
7456884 this is actually the first summer where i didnt just lounge around in st tropez or a private beach somewhere because its been non stop work when i was little i loved playing with dolls now that im grown up this show concept has given me my own real live dollhouse by having the bff contestants imagine all the trouble and fun i could cause all at once just with a text on my blackberry from me to them

7456886 theres an economic war going on and were losing it
7456887 but i think prices have probably fallen about 20 now
7456888 people understand now that their house is worth a lot less than it was last year anyone selling now is taking bad money
7456889 there really has never been a better time for first time buyers but the main problem is banks are not lending
7456890 we are dealing with very few enquiries and sales but the rental market is doing very well and rents are gradually increasing
7456891 if we were solely depending on house sales we could close our doors tomorrow there is nothing happening
7456892 if someone is thinking of selling then my honest advice would be leave it six months but then you worry it might get worse i really cant see things improving for 12 months
7456893 the unbundling and subsequent listing of adcock presents us with opportunities that will enable us to drive our vision of being recognised as a leading world class branded healthcare company
7456894 we are particularly excited by our investment into the business which includes ongoing upgrades and capacity expansions of existing facilities the construction in 2009 and 2010 of a green fields high volume liquids manufacturing facility in south africa and our development of a state of the art distribution centre due for completion in 2008 centrally and closely located to 65 percent of our customers

7456896 i want biffa the boys at the very top not to try to cover anything up or hide anything
7456897 come clean and then sort yourselves out and make sure this never happens again
7456898 the scheme which has concerned so many residents is now put back until 2010 11 and may not even be introduced at that stage
7456899 i am disappointed for many residents and share their frustration especially when i see the state of numerous windows in the estate
7456900 the answer to the delayed scheme in glenvarna is to paint the window frames of those properties whose tenants have complained and work round an approved number of properties
7456901 what has angered so many residents is that they see this as being too little too late they feel that queens park monkstown and new mossley have all had recent schemes undertaken and glenvarna is being left behind
7456902 the housing executive would normally replace windows where this is required as part of a major improvement scheme otherwise windows are serviced or replaced if necessary through our external maintenance programme
7456903 we are planning to include glenvarna properties in the external maintenance programme for 2009 2010 subject to available funding and in the meantime will continue to carry out repairs as these are needed
7456904 could not be explained by other factors such as birth weight the age of the mother order of birth gestational diabetes and whether the baby was breast fed or not
7456905 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7456906 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk would welcome more research in this area
7456907 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7456908 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7456909 the campus is closed in light of whats going on
7456910 tackling malnutrition should be a top priority for all nhs trusts
7456911 its shocking that many older people still find themselves trapped within a postcode lottery of commitment to improve nutritional standards on hospital wards
7456912 we know that good nutrition is central to peoples good health and ability to recover from illness which is why in october 2007 we launched the nutrition action plan in conjunction with over 25 leading stakeholders
7456913 this aims to outline how nutritional care and hydration can be improved amongst vulnerable adults in all health and social care settings

7456925 we are fully confident that senator clinton will do the right thing
7456926 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7456927 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7456928 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7456929 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7456930 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7456931 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7456932 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7456933 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7456934 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7456935 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7456936 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7456937 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7456938 my friend and i are willing to pay just about
7456939 people are trying to fit her somewhere in their minds and in this array of images we have in our culture about african american women as the vixen or the mammy or the angry black woman
7456940 but she doesnt fit any of the molds so she is kind of unsettling to a lot of people she is something new
7456941 for some people she is supposed to represent a woman who is more traditional in her approach to the office of first lady and be somebody to do the requisite entertaining and look after her husband
7456942 but some feel like the first lady should be more of an activist in the model of hillary clinton
7456943 imagine seeing her in the white house just the picture of her on the lawn with her two girls
7456944 in deep ways and superficial ways it would be a dramatic shift

7457006 there is a homely old adage which runs speak softly and carry a big stick you will go far if the american nation will speak softly and yet build and keep at a pitch of the highest training a thoroughly efficient navy the monroe doctrine will go far

7457010 we may not have as deep a pocket as some of the multibillion dollar corporations we compete with theyre very good competitors but that doesnt mean we cant out think them
7457011 if you look at the cash component thats going to be over 20bn in cash
7457012 we could fund most of that through our cash holdings but its likely were actually going to borrow for the first time its going to be a mixture of the cash we have on hand plus debt
7457013 we trust the yahoo board and the yahoo shareholders will join with us quickly in deciding to move down an integrated path
7457014 want to emphasise that absolutely no decisions have been made and despite what some people have tried to suggest theres certainly no integration process underway
7457015 this proposal is just that a proposal and it was only made in the last 24 hours you can be sure the board is going to review it thoughtfully and carefully and do whats right for our great company
7457016 we realise that this may have been a tough day for many of you especially those on the front lines of our business
7457017 we cant let any of the noise were hearing around this situation distract us from our core mission its critical that we continue to focus on running our business executing our strategy and delivering value to all of our users advertisers and publishers
7457018 at this stage of the investigation and on the basis of a wide range of internal and external advice we have no sense that this loss is likely to cause you to suffer financial loss or identity fraud
7457019 i know that the loss of the documents is inevitably a cause for concern but i want to assure you that the bbc is doing everything to recover the data and to minimise any risks that might ensue
7457020 i think i just decided i had to get over the fear of the new business not succeeding
7457021 the easiest thing is to say i have done something thats worked so why dont i just stick with it and people will always think well of me but who cares what people think
7457022 i think it is also kind of sad to just think about the past and lastminute ive always said i dont want to be one of those two in the muppets that just sit at the back and criticise other people
7457023 ebay is encouraging because one of their largest categories is furniture
7457024 and argos is encouraging because argos is the biggest seller of beds in this country but no one ever sees one they just see it in a catalogue
7457025 you go into a store and you see all these interior design mags but if i am on the web where do i go there is not a strong brand there
7457026 i was like wow i cant differentiate myself i dont think i am smarter than these people it is not physically possible to work harder so i had better work in england where people dont work as hard
7457027 that was a very conscious decision youve got to play to your innate competitive advantage i am probably not enough of a techie to have really thrived in silicon valley most of the people who do really well there are stanford engineer types and i did modern languages so i would have been given less leeway to do what i was able to do here
7457028 why were we smug because we smiled in the photos which we had been told to do i really dont think we were smug we always thought we were bloody lucky but there was a definite schadenfreude in the british psyche which was disappointing people like toby young asking why are there all these old etonians around

7457032 no really i dont i am very lucky to have made more than i would ever need i have a nice house and another in france and my kids will be comfortable i am fantastically lucky
7457033 we werent doing lastminute for short term financial gain and i know some people always question that but i really think for decent entrepreneurs money is the side effect

7457038 we are also a cultural element and this is the key factor in the core value of our product the newspapers are more than an information provider for the inhabitants of the relevant regions they are a bearer of historical and cultural awareness and social cohesion
7457039 the employees are under extreme pressure there are not enough people resources and incentives to achieve product differentiation quickly in order to achieve the necessary large scale success in the multimedia field
7457040 as the editors in chief we would like to stress that our papers are not just an economic product
7457041 we are also a cultural element and this is the key factor in the core value of our product the newspapers are more than an information provider for the inhabitants of the relevant regions they are a bearer of historical and cultural awareness and social cohesion
7457042 if you want a glimpse of how i think about foreign policy
7457043 read natan sharanskys book the case for democracy its a great book
7457044 either you elect the elites and rulers we need or no democracy reform or change for you
7457045 by now it should be clear that decades of excusing and accommodating tyranny for the sake of stability have only led to injustice and instability and tragedy
7457046 for too many years 60 to be precise american presidents were on both sides of the aisle by the way democrats and republicans were prepared to have a policy of exceptionalism in the middle east concerning democracy
7457047 we were prepared to say well authoritarian regimes are there either because the middle east well they dont really want freedom or we want stability or any number of reasons that we have we have not to push the democracy agenda in the middle east
7457048 we have supported tyranny in the past and we continue to support it today forget all the nonsense about democracy reform or change you see when push comes to shove our interests must prevail
7457049 any federal judge who uses some international law as a precedent to make a court decision ought to be impeached
7457050 we need to move the cultural norms to meet gods standards
7457051 i think it is important that the language of zion is a mother tongue and not a recently acquired second language
7457052 i spell god g o d not g o p
7457053 i predict that bible believing christians will step over policy differences they have with mike huckabee to stand by and support a candidate who is being attacked because he believes as they do that their christian faith should actually impact the way they live if that happens the recent meteoric rise of the huckabee campaign in the polls could look minuscule compared to the tsunami of support that he will get from christians

7457058 my parents concerns were more about assimilating and not being discriminated against
7457059 when they hear the numbers they dont have to translate it its automatic to them
7457060 i wanted to send my kids to this school to learn more about their culture
7457061 its true right now that were not having much participation from immigrant families with a mandarin background
7457062 if the parents decide to go into the immersion program they have to understand the philosophy that the kids are growing up in a larger english speaking environment and will eventually pick it up
7457063 the child will gain full competency in both languages by the eighth grade
7457064 we listen to mandarin dialog on mp3 files over dinner so its a family affair
7457065 parents also have to make a commitment to learn the language
7457066 i wish they had something like this when we were kids i feel a loss of connection with my culture
7457067 even my daughter in her first year we can have a conversation in mandarin
7457068 if they hear someone speaking in chinese at the store theyll start speaking with them
7457069 it was an awesome experience for me to be welcomed by the community i was taken aback by their graciousness and hospitality
7457070 i dont think any other culture goes to those lengths to treat their guests as well as they treated us
7457071 les miserables introduced me to the broadway community and was a huge learning experience
7457072 early on i had so much courage and support from the filipino community
7457073 im grateful to reconnect and rediscover the culture with pistahan
7457074 he is a talented world class performer and a good role model to filipino youth
7457075 people felt so strongly about that incident and it let them relive those experiences and get a broader perspective
7457076 originating a role and working on it from the ground up
7457077 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7457078 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7457079 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7457080 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7457081 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7457082 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news
7457083 as long as congress is sitting and not doing the peoples bidding then were going to be here
7457084 in general both parties have kept us down this militaristic path and neglected our basic needs
7457085 my dna fragrance is a scent that is so you
7457086 is it a science is it generic can it possibly be unique to just me what if my dna stinks is my dna safe
7457087 its amusing how many people want us to disclose our trade secret because they cant imagine how we can create a unique fragrance from your dna genetic code some imagine their dna may stink but dna has no odor each fragrance undergoes an individualized formulation process which begins only when the blueprint your dna profile is submitted to the perfumer by the lab to assure the customer that a dna analysis is performed we provide each of our customers with a copy of their dna profile at the time the analysis is completed and those results are going into the formulation process everyone wants to know how we do it but then thats the secret

7457089 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7457090 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7457091 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7457092 i didnt know anything at all about it until everyone started texting me saying congratulations
7457093 but at the same time i do feel like im more than capable of doing it and proving to them that i am worthy of something like that one day
7457094 the guys just look up to him because they know hes hard as nails
7457095 its rare in our culture to see pop culture icons emulating politicians
7457096 usually its the other way around the politicians try to look cool
7457097 independent media and things that are not controlled by the campaign have influenced our conversation things like the will i am yes we can video
7457098 campaigns have much less control over the narrative of their candidate right now
7457099 when barack won the nomination i just started bawling with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
7457100 michelle obamas the first potential first lady in a while that could be a model
7457101 those are the instant reactions you get one is the grizzled old war vet the other is this very hopeful idealistic figure
7457102 bill clinton said obama is living a fairy tale and that was sort of the cue for our take
7457103 they seized the moment and it was great great comedy
7457104 they saw an opportunity to not just make fun of politics but to engage in it and to actually take a fairly unsuccessful ad take the target hilton and have that target talk back
7457105 everything is so publicity and celebrity driven theres no way that you can keep them apart
7457106 what does paris hilton want publicity this was just a godsend for her
7457107 pop culture gossip blogs are now actually picking up and covering some political topics this year because we have a candidate who defies the saying politics is show business for ugly people
7457108 obama is sexy not since kennedy has there been such a good looking sort of sexually attractive candidate and thats more interesting than not sexy
7457109 its a good thing that people are interested enough in politics to gossip about it
7457110 last time i checked were also having serious conversations about foreign policy and the energy crisis if the only coverage of this that existed was on tmz yes that would be bad
7457111 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7457112 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7457113 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7457114 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7457115 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god

7457150 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
7457151 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community

7457171 travel planning process is as sophisticated or as simple as the traveller wants it to be
7457172 it has made travel planning more flexible and opportunistic but i wouldnt say that web 2 0 travel sites always mean a greater level of difficulty if you take sheraton com as a good example researching travel and user generated content is actually simpler as a result of the changes we made that allow guests to research travel related stories from other guests from the sheraton com home page
7457173 i would also argue that the travel planning process is as sophisticated or as simple as the traveler wants it to be someone who has a high level of familiarity with web 2 0 travel sites should be perfectly at ease obtaining knowledge and researching travel on these sites alternatively those that are less comfortable on these sites will still obtain relevant knowledge from the vast array of other travel related sites available
7457174 since the explosion of web 2 0 there are new technologies vendors and opportunities to take advantage of which were not there 18 months ago with that said i believe that europe is moving right behind the us and will take advantage of web 2 0 and all that goes with that i think it is a very exciting time for europe it is going to be great to watch it come to life
7457175 if you want a successful pan european ugc strategy then a company or brand needs a decentralised structure that passes responsibility to the local regions and allows them to communicate and establish content strategies within a global framework

7457178 powers outside the caucasus region should not seek excuses for tensions and instability in the crisis area
7457179 their destiny in the caucasus would definitely not be different than the dilemma they have in other regions where they have already created a crisis
7457180 the conflict between the two world powers us and russia are indeed subject of concern
7457181 we support peace and stability in the caucasus area and the crisis over there should be tackled within its own place
7457182 we however hope that wrong calculations and signals would not lead to renewed conflicts
7457183 this law is specifically for legislators in the national assembly and senate
7457184 ive had it with these people i was about to park and this dumb ass pulled in and took the spot i had to drive the entire block to find parking can you believe it
7457185 there are times i really hate indians they are so inconsiderate
7457186 they pee shit in public throw trash any where and every where they are so corrupt they are so
7457187 yeah i know inconsiderate why dont you look at the menu and see what you want to eat i am famished
7457188 crass uncouth indians i think i will have a garden omelet and some fresh lime soda without sugar
7457189 some guy grabbed her parking space and she blamed all of us for the shit she faced i mean we indians do our bit we are considerate and polite we are the happiest people in the world and very hard working why do rich people like her always sell our country short inconsiderate she said i say she is inconsiderate
7457190 why is my cutlet cold whats wrong with you people what kind of service is this
7457191 get me a new cutlet and make it quick and dont you add it to the bill you hear me or else i will talk to the owner about you i know him very well go get me my food
7457192 jeez dude be a little more considerate you blew right on my face
7457193 dont you know that you arent supposed to blow into peoples faces that is the first rule of smoking
7457194 well where is my food i swear i will never return to this place again
7457195 people talk about the attraction maybe because im the manager
7457196 i was joking when i said because i was the manager
7457197 i know football clubs and sunderland is a top top football club
7457198 our fans came out today and when you travel from sunderland we know its expensive
7457199 as i said im just trying to change the mentality i think sunderland was a big club before but maybe with small ideas and small ambitions and im just trying to change that with everybody i work with
7457200 thank god everyones really plugged into it it helped we got promoted so quickly otherwise people might have started doubting me
7457201 the board have accepted the bid sunderlands hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision has been taken out of my ands
7457202 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7457203 were hopeful with one in particular and well be working hard next week to get the other player im interested in
7457204 but if we dont get him ive said ive been very lucky ive had great backing im not here stamping my feet thinking if i dont get these two players its the end of the world its not
7457205 but its only been this summer bringing in experienced players last summer we werent able to attract them
7457206 we werent able to afford their wages first of all and one or two players didnt fancy coming to us
7457207 i felt after last season we certainly needed one or two players who were streetwise
7457208 i have to look at that side of it but i just thought at this time the club needed players who knew the premier league
7457209 we saw that today with diouf at certain situations in the game when it was tight hed hold people off take the ball and win a free kick
7457210 we didnt have players like that last year we were so naive i remember everton 7 1 defeat it seems like yesterday luton 3 0 defeat seems like yesterday we were just so raw
7457211 now were a bit more streetwise malbranque showed it when to go in when to stay on your feet
7457212 you keep telling strikers theyll get most of their goals in the six yard box
7457213 we have plenty of videos to show our players where all the strikers get their goals six yards out the michael owens the ruud van nistelrooys
7457214 they strikers dont get many from outside the box so it was good to see him cisse in the six yard box
7457215 hes settled in okay and if he keeps scoring goals then hopefully ill be turning down 30m offers for him
7457216 but we wont be dancing in the streets of sunderland trust me
7457217 were happy with the progress were making ive been in the job two minutes but it was a good step for us today
7457218 theyre so much more streetwise some of our lads have only been with us two or three weeks so theyll be getting to know us
7457219 theyve all plugged in to what were about and what we have in abundance is character and desire but we wont be dancing in the streets for beating tottenham away from home
7457220 i know its the first time for 30 years but we have to get the balance right well celebrate with a cup of tea and a nice sandwich
7457221 weve won one away from home it took us until april last year so its a decent start for us weve now got a decent game against forest and then manchester city
7457222 not that were getting blas about it were delighted for our supporters
7457223 i cant say too much because if i start saying things about the referee then ill end up getting in trouble
7457224 there were a lot of decisions that incensed ourselves and the supporters and quite rightly so
7457225 you dont expect something like that to happen it was never a corner you can tell by players reactions if a decision is right or not and the referee should have been cute enough to say i have got this wrong
7457226 neil austin and rob purdie who was on the other side of the pitch at left back are adamant it wasnt a corner
7457227 its his first year in the league and i dont think he was up with play a lot but weve got to live with it youve just got to deal with it when you get these referees coming out of the conference
7457228 sooner or later the referee had to give us one
7457229 simon saved an initial shot and then their player back heeled the ball in its a cruel way to lose especially when youve played so well but that just sums up our day
7457230 im not going to labour the point but i think were very close
7457231 we all want him to stay all of us its got to the point where weve got an agreement but thats got to be right for both parties i know he wants to stay and i know he likes it here it will run its course but i think were pretty close
7457232 youll have to ask them ashley and wise whether thats strengthened the case but i would have thought its done it no harm
7457233 michael did what he does better than anyone else in the world
7457234 as soon as he gets the ball i come alive there are certain players who are always looking for through balls and openings and geremi is one of them its great for strikers when players get the ball out of their feet and cross it quickly
7457235 we did it at last ive trained moderate horses all my life this proves that if i get a good horse i can train a group winner
7457236 his hearing is on september 5 and i will go down there and speak on his behalf and in his defence
7457237 i dont know what the fa will do i cant do anything about that
7457238 but i will go and support him 100 per cent because thats what i said i would do it wasnt a decision i made on the spur of the moment i thought long and hard about it what happened took place before i came to the club and the joey barton i have seen here is a different lad
7457239 damien will have a better chance of recovering because his problem was just a kick but it was a bad one
7457240 i feel like i have a point to prove because i think i can do really well in the premier league and i want to show people im a good player and i can score goals in this division
7457241 the way i play my game i think im made for england thats why i really wanted to come back
7457242 i had a few different offers from the premier league but i chose sunderland because of the manager and because the club have big ambitions and infrastructure i think its a good club
7457243 i want to do my best and to make the move permanent
7457244 el hadji called me he had a few words with me and said the ambition at the club is good so i said good
7457245 its a good lively forward line with me and el hadji and there are plenty of other players who are quality
7457246 nobody expects sunderland to be a good team but i know the boys now and we really want to show people that we are a good club and that we can go and do well we can surprise a lot of teams like we did against tottenham
7457247 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7457248 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7457249 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7457250 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7457251 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7457252 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7457253 everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued
7457254 theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire
7457255 i wake up every morning wondering how on the earth im going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day
7457256 with the exception of the campaign trail and life in the public eye i have to say that my life now is really not that much different from many of yours
7457257 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7457258 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

7457261 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7457262 we have short term changes called forbush decreases caused by eruptions on the sun where cosmic ray flux can decrease dramatically over one or two days and then gradually recover
7457263 the cosmic ray signature on clouds if there is one should show up here
7457264 this is a careful piece of work by jon egill kristjansson that appears to find no evidence for the reputed link between cosmic rays and clouds
7457265 its supporting other recent work that also found no relationship
7457266 i think that as a factor in climate change its pretty clear that we dont have any indication at this point that this is important at all
7457267 whereas global mean temperatures have been rising steadily over the last 30 years we see that the cosmic ray flux has been steady
7457268 the energetic particles induce nox production and the nox is then transported down to the stratosphere
7457269 nox destroys ozone in catalytic reaction cycles and when you change ozone in the stratosphere that can then feed down to surface temperatures
7457270 the results were amazing and i think its something significant that we have to take into account
7457271 and i dont think it has a big impact on global temperatures
7457272 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
7457273 sir alexs record shows that he would be the ideal choice for manager
7457274 i would not in any way shape or form try and commit myself to something that is four years ahead
7457275 as host nation we get the right to entry in all competitions so obviously we should be allowed to have a team in 2012
7457276 what we need to do is make sure that we can reach an agreement to have a british team there and if we have sir alex ferguson as a manager then that would be fantastic
7457277 as a manchester united supporter obviously hed be my number one choice i would say that but im sure that hed do a great job
7457278 i have talked to sir alex ferguson about managing the team
7457279 he would have to be approached formally by the relevant authorities but hes been one of the names mentioned and hes not turned the job down
7457280 there appeared to be a deal between the home nations that the england womens team would be able to play in beijing but because they got through to the quarter final of the world cup they didnt enter the olympics

7457284 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7457285 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7457286 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7457287 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7457288 ill let mary schweitzer speak for herself and allow the people to decide flesh and blood from a 65 million year old dinosaur dragon thats still funny but you have to ask yourself why this isnt paraded around like their mighty date testing crap could be the people would see the man behind the curtain
7457289 if you cant trust the first words of the bible gen 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
7457290 oh come on you guys believe all life sprang up from a rock a rock that is faith for ya what a maroon
7457291 they recently dated the new dome on top the volcano want to know how old the tests say 340 000 to 2 8 million years not only is that wrong but look at that margin not only is the error off by a multiple of 100 000 28 years 2 800 000 years but the gap between the readings is nearly 2 5 million years but that is a small camel to swallow for the camel swallowing long earth agers it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that the radiometric indicators used by evolutionists to get their great ages of the earth can be off by as much as a factor of 1 billion due to a billion fold acceleration of beta decay add to that the known errors in radiocarbon dating and you have an earth age that is dead center on the 6000 year age indicated by the genealogies in genesis and subsequent recorded histories in the tanakh so a 100 000 fold error is a small pill to swallow for these religious evolutionist nuts who have already swallowed a camel they have always gone on blind faith without any genuine bona fide evidence to support it
7457292 johnny has been as lost as a frog in a hailstorm from the very beginning of this discussion
7457293 and who made you the creator of the english language
7457294 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7457295 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7457296 ahh johhny so full of arogance heres what god says about people like you rom 1 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
7457297 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7457298 ignore aks arguments havent ignored any theres just no challenge to them he apparently ran out of evo proof and had to attack the bible i think his head burst after the massive amount of replys that came in god will always call some one to defend his word i wont respond to the last comment i dont swing that way johhny
7457299 case in point coelacanth fish the great and mighty transitional fossil
7457300 heres a prediction for ya romans 1 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen 26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 30 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 31 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful 32 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
7457301 what a maroon that has already been done except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment the testing lab was not told in advance where the rock came from so they could not fake the results to agree with how old they thought the rock was choke on it
7457302 except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment
7457303 johnny johnny johnny the fossils for the coelacanth are 140 million years old whenfisrt discovered it was proclaimed a missing link that is until they were found alive 140 million years and 0 change thats a big0 nothing no evolutionary advancement what so ever you cant get over that you cant explain that away the only way you can is if the fossils werent found in 140 million year old dirt give it a rest already you failed
7457304 thats industry wide your mad your millions of years have sunk to the bottom there was no deceite in the test like i said call the company and complain a test is a test is a test why what would have happened if they told them where it was from shouldnt the results be the same are you saying theres 2 standards of testing johnny is there improbriaty in the lab
7457305 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state

7457307 we believe that a more expansive and robust broadband infrastructure will help make internet connectivity accessible and affordable to more people in the country

7457354 there should be an opportunity for students to be educated about alcohol and right now we cant do it in good conscience we have to tell students that its illegal to drink but if you are going to drink this is how you should do it that is a mix message to send students
7457355 the 21 year old age limit does not prevent binge drinking it happens in campuses across the country and i think if we were able to show responsible drinking and modeled responsible drinking and we educate students about it would be very beneficial for everybody
7457356 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior at present we are constrained only to talk about abstinence since anything else is against the law treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions

7457369 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
7457370 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
7457371 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
7457372 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
7457373 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
7457374 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils

7457377 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
7457378 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
7457379 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
7457380 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
7457381 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
7457382 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
7457383 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
7457384 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
7457385 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
7457386 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
7457387 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
7457388 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
7457389 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
7457390 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
7457391 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
7457392 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
7457393 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
7457394 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places

7457404 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
7457405 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
7457406 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
7457407 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
7457408 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
7457409 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
7457410 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
7457411 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing

7457433 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
7457434 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
7457435 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
7457436 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
7457437 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
7457438 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
7457439 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
7457440 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
7457441 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
7457442 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
7457443 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
7457444 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
7457445 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
7457446 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
7457447 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
7457448 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
7457449 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
7457450 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
7457451 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
7457452 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
7457453 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
7457454 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
7457455 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
7457456 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
7457457 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
7457458 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7457459 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
7457460 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets
7457461 trailblazer in pursuit of oil the re opening of azerbaijan to the west
7457462 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7457463 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes
7457464 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
7457465 age 41 he mathematically could be the grandson of a perpetrator of the armenian genocide instead hes armed with rhetorical skills a smile and turkish government talking points and propaganda
7457466 the role and challenges of turkey in a globalizing world
7457467 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
7457468 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
7457469 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
7457470 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
7457471 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
7457472 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
7457473 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
7457474 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
7457475 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
7457476 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
7457477 in view of the dilly dallying tactics of the government on the issue the samiti has decided to continue its agitation and so it extended the bandh upto august 31
7457478 as soon as i saw the ball you have to know whos on third
7457479 he didnt take off for home right away so i knew i could tag the bag and throw home if he took off right away i would throw home
7457480 that definitely put pressure on them and changed the inning

7457482 ive gone to three olympics now and theyve all been special in their own way
7457483 but i think beijing has just done a superb job of all the little details and my entire team has enjoyed themselves here
7457484 athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marvelled at their ability
7457485 we found it unusual that none of these applications came through with protests
7457486 we have inquired with the authorities who said the protests and the queries of the citizens have been met in mutual agreement
7457487 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g 8 nation lets be g 8 at all levels
7457488 chiar daca negocierile se reiau o transnistrie plina de incredere si sustinuta de rusia i ar putea cere presedintelui voronin un pret care il depaseste pe cel pe care l ar putea plati in mod normal si justificabil pentru mostenirea adica solutionarea conflictului lasata de el inainte de finalul celui de al doilea mandat

7457490 si nuestra am rica no ha de ser sino una prolongaci n de europa si lo nico que hacemos es ofrecer suelo nuevo a la explotaci n del hombre por el hombre y por desgracia esa es hasta ahora nuestra nica realidad si no nos decidimos a que sta sea la tierra de promisi n para la humanidad cansada de buscarla en todos los climas no tenemos justificaci n ser a preferible dejar desiertas nuestras altiplanicies y nuestras pampas si s lo hubieran de servir para que en ellas se multiplicaran los dolores humanos no los dolores que nada alcanzar a evitar nunca los que son hijos del amor y la muerte sino los que la codicia y la soberbia infligen al d bil y al hambriento

7457501 de juana es un terrorista y un desgraciado pero ha cumplido su condena
7457502 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7457503 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7457504 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7457505 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7457506 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7457507 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7457508 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7457509 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7457510 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines
7457511 from that its probably not too big a leap to think its probably at least somewhat true across the board
7457512 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change
7457513 to me its a plan that says theyre going to do more planning
7457514 my study plots in california at least indicate theyve continued to plummet and very seriously so
7457515 politics is like a soap opera you can be away for six months come back and you havent missed much
7457516 marley verkade f r fred och tolerans genom sin musik
7457517 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7457518 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7457519 we are eager to see kids ideas and everyday items transformed into innovative and intriguing inventions what a great way to inspire a fresh approach to recycling not to mention a new crop of engineers and designers
7457520 what i created as a kid from weekend home improvement projects with my parents to lego masterpieces on our living room floor shaped my interest in engineering and the design process invention is infectious with the trash to treasure contest we are hoping to inspire the next generation of innovators and engineers
7457521 paying for a good 30 to 40 years of electricity
7457522 its reasonable to assume when looking at the cost effectiveness of solar power systems that the cost of power from your local utility is going to go up in the future
7457523 were certainly looking to get photovoltaic systems on rooftops and anything that does that is a pretty good idea
7457524 is the main problem with this so called nuclear rebirth
7457525 green building will continue to grow it is not a question of whether your firm should invest in understanding the green sustainable trend and how to produce sustainable projects its how much should you invest and how fast
7457526 developing a strategy now to assess the capabilities of your firm and create actions to take advantage of the sustainable opportunities is fundamental
7457527 many people think of this as a trivial pursuit simply a matter of flipping a switch
7457528 but you just cant do that in most applications you have to build awareness good lighting is a big help because bad lighting is the problem
7457529 not necessarily turned off but lights redirected downward so they dont intrude into secluded zones or residential areas
7457530 its more a matter of attitude than mechanics its finally deciding that you dont want to infringe upon another persons nighttime privacy or into quiet corners
7457531 the milky way often is the measuring stick for dark sky watchers
7457532 if you go to an atlas and take it from the midwest to the east coast there are few places the size of a county that have unpolluted dark skies here in the west there are only a couple of good areas where you can see and feel the darkness but theyre hard to get to
7457533 it really wouldnt take a lot of money to solve this
7457534 most people who have changed their lighting systems have saved money in the process
7457535 i was upset about streetlights shining into my second floor bedroom windows
7457536 ive been working with a variety of scientists and policy makers for a couple of years to help fight it
7457537 we try to manage light as you would any pollution emission
7457538 twenty seven states currently have laws or proposed laws for energy lighting or eliminating upward directed lights
7457539 that kind of lighting blinds good people and bad people alike two thirds of all property crime occurs during the day and as far as im concerned the need for security lighting is a myth it gets to where the cities have to pay for their streetlights rather than hire more officers to patrol the streets
7457540 theres a whole generation of children growing up a large fraction of whom have never seen the stars
7457541 fifteen percent of the u s population or one in seven americans has some type of learning disability
7457542 the goal of the program is to be able to quantify and understand the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon balance
7457543 we were intrigued by ponderosa pine because its very widely distributed globally so its an important species
7457544 theres a lot of focus on the trees but theyre not thinking about the other stuff thats in there
7457545 it took those sites somewhere between 15 and 20 years before they became carbon neutral again
7457546 people need to understand that these old growth forests are very important
7457547 were trying to offer a caution that a portion of what has been called normal aging might in fact be due to ubiquitous environmental exposures like lead
7457548 the fact that its happening with lead is the first proof of principle that its possible
7457549 i think many things impact how we age but i think right now its maybe premature to be giving lead a huge role in our age related cognitive decline
7457550 these two research groups are finding adverse effects on the aging brain at low levels of lead exposure more work needs to be done but these studies are raising important questions
7457551 biofuels have become a flash point through which a wide range of social and environmental issues are currently being played out in the media
7457552 particularly in the asia pacific region land availability is a critical issue
7457553 there are clear comparative advantages for tropical and subtropical countries in growing biofuel feed stocks but it is often these same countries in which resource and land rights of vulnerable groups and protected forests are weakest
7457554 and were probably still just scratching the surface in terms of places rfid can be used
7457555 rifle through peoples pockets purses suitcases briefcases luggage and possibly their kitchens and bedrooms anytime of the day or night
7457556 youve got the possibility of unauthorized people learning stuff about who you are what youve bought how and where youve bought it
7457557 think of it as a high tech form of dumpster diving
7457558 its going to be used in unintended ways by third parties not just the government but private investigators marketers lawyers building a case against you
7457559 once a tagged item is associated with a particular individual personally identifiable information can be obtained and then aggregated to develop a profile
7457560 are companies using that information incorrectly and are they giving it out inappropriately im sure thats happening should we be concerned yes
7457561 security and privacy are a top priority for american express in everything we do
7457562 a common area of a school shopping center bus station or other place of public accommodation
7457563 used to monitor the movement of the person through the store or other areas
7457564 to monitor the movement of the person through the store or other areas
7457565 systems and methods for tracking consumers in a store environment
7457566 where a consumer is looking i e which way she is facing whether she is bending over or crouching down to look at a lower shelf
7457567 the industry has long promised it would never use this technology to track people but these patent records clearly suggest otherwise
7457568 we file thousands of patents every year which are designed to protect concepts or ideas
7457569 the reality is that many of those ideas and concepts never see the light of day
7457570 not every element in a patent filing is necessarily something we would pursue
7457571 under no circumstance would we use this technology without a customers permission
7457572 data on individual consumers is gold and the only thing preventing these companies from abusing technologies like rfid to get at that gold is public scrutiny
7457573 nobody cares about radio tags on crates and pallets but if we dont keep rfid off of individual consumer items our stores will one day turn into retail zoos where the customer is always on exhibit
7457574 to ensure the supply for a short period of time shouldnt be a problem but to keep the long term sustainable use of resources is a challenge
7457575 i think one of the things the olympics is showing is its desperation time and beijing has the power
7457576 for two years we havent used water for rice because its been given to beijing
7457577 i have no objection i support it for the success of the 2008 olympics china must win
7457578 very few people used toilets in the 1950s but right now everyone uses toilets uses showers uses swimming pools and fancy buildings use lots of water
7457579 we dont have water but no one mentions it all the policy makers never mention that just develop develop
7457580 were seeing a groundswell of momentum and real measurable progress
7457581 the other 40 percent just arent taking the issue seriously or they arent willing to pay a penny more to move in the right direction
7457582 critical mass has no doubt been reached and my sense is that the majority of those publishers that arent acting will step up and join their peers in this effort
7457583 has been actively working to increase usage of recycled papers in its print products and has in fact substantially increased its use of recycled papers in recent years
7457584 while we havent formally adopted corporate wide percentage goals for use of recycled papers we are currently reviewing procurement policies from the standpoint of environmental impact
7457585 university presses and a few smaller presses were making progress
7457586 we were already working on our own environmental initiatives but to have random house step up like that encourages everyone in the industry to come forward
7457587 we knew going into this project that one of the greatest challenges was saving energy for the client because many doors would be constantly open from continuous foot traffic
7457588 obviously energy savings and performance were important factors in choosing air curtains but equally important was the aesthetics
7457589 the sliding doors can stay open for hours and very little train shed air infiltrates the space due to the combination of air curtains and space pressurization
7457590 to have someone of camerons calibre lead this club into the future is very exciting it is well known that cameron and the demons go a long way back
7457591 all of the new board has been impressed with his football knowledge his management credentials and his drive with cameron as the ceo we are convinced that melbourne can become the club that all demons crave we have some unfinished business to do
7457592 the melbourne football club has been a considerable part of my own personal heritage its where i started my working life 25 years ago i would like to think that i can play a role in securing the future of the club
7457593 jim and his board have brought hope to melbourne and it is now my job to help build a team who can match that hope with expectation and performance
7457594 questa sera come appassionato di calcio ho apprezzato ogni cosa la prestazione dellinter quella della roma e anche quella della terna arbitrale non sembrava una partita di calcio dagosto le squadre si sono date battaglia per oltre due ore giocando con ritmo e intensit siamo riusciti a mettere in pratica almeno per unora di gioco quanto preparato in settimana pressing alto sulla fonte del loro gioco mi piaciuta molto anche la reazione finale della squadra che ha portato al gol di balotelli lunica cosa fuori contesto stata la loro seconda rete la squadra ha dimostrato di essere psicologicamente molto forte e tatticamente compatta questo un grande gruppo un gruppo eccezionale
7457595 se ho potuto vincere questa supercoppa perch un allenatore prima di me ha vinto lo scudetto con linter per questo motivo credo e sia giusto in questa occasione dedicare un pensiero a roberto capitato anche a me in passato di essere nella sua situazione di oggi ho vinto la champions con il porto e poi grazie a questo successo quando io ero gi al chelsea il porto ha potuto giocare la supercoppa europea e la coppa intercontinentale nessuno allora si ricordato di me io invece voglio ricordare roberto che allinter ha fatto un ottimo lavoro e ha vinto tanto

7457599 you know when it was really cold and snowing we went for a walk through lincoln park and that was just magical
7457600 you can get a seat in a restaurant and the streets are a little less crowded and the shops are a little less crowded
7457601 these attractions are probably even more appealing in the winter when the crowds are thinner
7457602 what you have is a semi graphic and symbolic representation of the ball game which allows for its reconstruction after the fact
7457603 represents a discrete event a batters trip around the bases and from the sum of these one can read off how the entire game unfolded patterns and developments display themselves and just at a glance one can see the nature of the game
7457604 global warming and the climate change is very important to me because it affects my livelihood but i think every one of us has the responsibility to do everything we can to get our planet back on balance what the x games did by reducing the carbon footprint i think its a great charge for the demographic that they appeal to
7457605 environment protection has always been at the core of our philosophy of how we approach our events
7457606 from day 1 weve always grown our event to manage our environment as best we can so we can leave it better than we found it the x games environmentality was a way for us to leave sort of a public side of it a little bit of a legacy to our fans
7457607 i love the idea that they want to leave this planet as it was before
7457608 they want to come and have this amazing event but equalize the footprint by doing all the steps that theyre doing to make it really eco friendly more and more people are starting to do this and its a great step in the right direction
7457609 theyre comprised of 80 percent potato starch and 20 percent soybean oil it looks like plastic but it has a different feel to it its functional but it biodegrades as soon as it gets into the landfill
7457610 its part of the universitys campus wide initiative to become more aware of day to day activities and the impact on the environment
7457611 each small thing we can do if you multiply this by a hundred that is a hundred times better than in the past
7457612 all the waste food and any napkins or jelly containers go through this food pulper which shreds the material to corn kernel size and removes 80 percent of the liquid its reducing the amount of product that would end up in the sanitary system
7457613 we havent been as successful with the green cleaning products
7457614 the more awareness there is about this the more demand there is which means the suppliers become more attentive to fill the need
7457615 this is a big decision it says new coal plants cant go to the federal government for money at least for the next couple years and these are critical times for companies to get these plants built
7457616 well have to look elsewhere for funding which will increase the interest expense which will increase the electric bill for the consumers at the end of the line
7457617 i was a bit worried in the beginning whether it was going to inconvenience my family or i wouldnt be able to take a bath
7457618 there are not any real show stoppers for this technology being used in the u s
7457619 ultimately i expect that some fraction of homes will use this technology but it will be a very long time before a sizable fraction does
7457620 we recognize it is a growing concern and were taking it very seriously
7457621 new york citys drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system
7457622 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7457623 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7457624 based on what we now know i would say we find theres little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health
7457625 theres no doubt about it pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds in the small concentrations that theyre at could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms
7457626 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7457627 it could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something we havent gotten far enough along
7457628 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7457629 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7457630 we realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations
7457631 were going to be able to learn a lot more
7457632 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7457633 my departments on that mission and ive joined right in on it
7457634 the federal government has known about this problem since at least 1980 and have never done anything about it
7457635 smoke alarm technology and education is a priority for the cpsc
7457636 will rank among the cleanest most environmentally friendly in the world
7457637 if you wanted to build a cleaner greener refinery youd start with a cleaner crude stock
7457638 unlike most refineries the hyperion energy center will not use a catalytic or cat cracker
7457639 cat crackers tend to have substantial emissions including fine particle emissions
7457640 whats in the permit is the tip of the iceberg
7457641 and whats underneath that iceberg is a huge amount of emissions thats not being accounted for
7457642 we will have monitors and a vapor recovery system that will capture gaseous hydrocarbons and place them back in the system where they belong
7457643 there are people who are very attached to the emissions estimating techniques as being gospel and then theres another cadre of people who think theyre garbage
7457644 its kind of an internal fight but theyve been around for 20 years now and so trying to overcome that is a tremendous issue
7457645 i think everybody pretty much agrees that air quality in minnehaha county is pretty good
7457646 once those have been issued those permits become basically a contract guaranteeing hyperion will not violate those pollutant loadings
7457647 the greenhouse gas emissions are naturally something that all of us are looking at
7457648 the question is do you have another refinery create the emissions do you turn down new business in one state because you can have the emissions come from another state
7457649 coke and coal are very interchangeable from a gasification perspective
7457650 in fact generally speaking you kind of like to maybe have a little coal with the coke just to add more ash to the system to help handle the slide and the canadian nickel that comes from the heavy oils
7457651 these comments reflect the front line experience of our members who strive to help protect workers on job sites across the country in all industries including construction

7457653 this rule if adopted without significant changes would provide for a significantly lower level of safety than what is currently required throughout the construction industry by the z117 1 2003 standard
7457654 rulemaking that provides less worker protection than that provided by a widely adopted voluntary consensus standard like z117 1 goes against oshas duty established under the national technology transfer and advancement act of 1995
7457655 taken as a whole they point to rulemaking that is not complete and that has not been undertaken with the purpose of finding a way to work with those who are experts in confined space safety in order to advance properly this nations commitment to protecting workers
7457656 asse is deeply concerned that osha decided against using terminology and definitions in its proposed standard that have existed for decades are widely used in the safety and health community and in industry when addressing confined space risks to workers
7457657 the primary benefit is that thats where the young people are
7457658 they are out looking at youtube every day as theyre exploring youtube we want them to find odu
7457659 from virtual campus tours to chemistry lectures education channels on youtube are microcosms of the vibrant world of higher ed
7457660 we are excited to see a broad range of higher education institutions launch youtube channels its a powerful way to connect scholars and self learners worldwide
7457661 while i appreciate the tour of the campus as a good starting point the value is when the lectures are available
7457662 these kinds of sites are a great tool to do that
7457663 students can see some of the art things that are going on that maybe they didnt know about perhaps that will encourage them to go in person the next time something rolls around they really get an idea of whats going on on campus
7457664 it will bring a lot more international students here because youtube is a phenomenon that is understood by everybody
7457665 while 72 percent of the children online belonged to a social networking site usually myspace 60 percent of them said they rarely or never read blogs
7457666 the 376th air expeditionary wing provided two large fire trucks an ambulance and nearly two dozen medical and fire and crash support personnel to the scene of the accident
7457667 medical personnel have also been requested to provide support at the manas international airport terminal which is adjacent to the base
7457668 would i rather see him or stern faced rows of party apparatchiks
7457669 we deserve to have a football team gb at the olympics and i hope it gets sorted
7457670 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely id be a fool not to the biggest problem id have is who to leave out
7457671 im also intensely proud that london is now in charge of the olympic legacy
7457672 we will deliver a fantabulous olympics in the home of sport
7457673 per essere detentori di un fondo chiamato quercia bisognava essere stupidi oltre che ladri
7457674 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power thats not the way to deal in the 21st century

7457676 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7457677 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7457678 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7457679 la prima or am depus memoriul la comisia de disciplin a federa iei rom ne de fotbal prin care contest m decizia arbitrului istvan kovacs care a a teptat doar 30 de minute ca nocturna s se aprind regulamentele sunt de partea noastr nu am spus o doar noi cei de la poli ia i ci i oficiali ai comisiei centrale a arbitrilor i chiar ai ligii profesioniste de fotbal prin urmare a tept m o solu ionare favorabil nou a acestui caz adic reprogramarea meciului

7457681 mi se pare lips de fair play din partea domnului bos nceanu din c te am auzit antrenorul ion marin a declarat c farul nu accept s c tige puncte la masa verde iar aceasta este o atitudine de l udat

7457683 we have an unbelievable team behind us management and technical
7457684 i know with confidence that when i step onto the track my bike will in absolutely perfect working order i cant remember the last time a mechanical problem was a factor in any gb races when i start a race it is a big boost mentally to have the certain knowledge that nobody lining up against me starts with an edge in fact it is always us who have the edge
7457685 if anyone in my back up team thinks they should be in front of him i dont want them
7457686 we are all here to back him up we are all behind him
7457687 um das leben der verletzten zu retten gab ein polizist mit seiner dienstwaffe einen schuss ab und traf den angreifer
7457688 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7457689 its the opportunity for michelle to tell the story of her life
7457690 it will be a very personal story that she tells we want to give them voters a sense of the obama family and how they would be in the white house
7457691 i thought ok hes probably not all that terrific and hes probably kind of a clown and then i found out that his name was barack obama
7457692 and like everybody else i thought well what kind of name is that
7457693 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7457694 she has been absolutely savaged by the talk shows rush limbaugh and sean hannity pull her apart almost every day
7457695 she knows who she is and where she comes from
7457696 at prices higher than face value and there are transaction charges
7457697 all of these costs are set by the ioc and the vancouver organizing committee and our company is required to buy all of the tickets up front and we then take the risk of resale
7457698 the u s is sort of special i think because its our closest neighbor
7457699 our view is that much larger numbers will be coming in from the united states than any other country ive had more inquiries from leaders in the u s particularly in the northwest than from any other part of the world were expecting this and were currently sifting our way through it
7457700 we want to make sure we do it in such a way that theres a real value to having a ticket to the olympics
7457701 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
7457702 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
7457703 the once every four years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation deliberation activism and change that surrounds us in local elections
7457704 bad for democracy how the presidency undermines the power of the people
7457705 even the best presidents need social movements to accomplish transformational change
7457706 fdr could not have succeeded without the agitation of the unemployed workers councils and the unions and lbjs greatest accomplishments were made possible by the civil rights movement
7457707 it is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power
7457708 this rare and brief exercise of their free choice however important it may be will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking feeling and acting for themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity
7457709 we have a number of tough decisions to make it appears going down the stretch here and that has to be included in that group
7457710 it was definitely nice to go out there and show that i can compete at this level
7457711 all you can ask for is the opportunity and i feel like i got it here in seattle
7457712 im definitely confident in my abilities and every time i walk on the field im confident
7457713 i wouldnt be out there if i couldnt make it i feel like im a much better kicker than i was in college
7457714 as you get older you learn to kick less and just get more quality
7457715 im still trying to work on my kickoffs i was a little excited how well i did in the game without practicing much
7457716 i gave it a little extra because theres a young guy back there whos pretty good you know
7457717 i think im getting too old to catch that guy in a race
7457718 i cant worry about brandon or anybody else or what theyre coaches thinking all the time im sure theyre happy with both of us
7457719 la fel o sa fie si cand vom avea copii si ei vor pleca de acasa
7457720 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7457721 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7457722 in the past two weeks we had largely secured the zone but you have to be frank we were guilty of overconfidence
7457723 we need what is called afghanisation thats to say to pass responsibilities all responsibilities as quickly as possible to the
7457724 the clumsiest literal translation is a thousand times more useful than the prettiest paraphrase
7457725 in an introspective manner means that the poet must really listen to his inner voice observe his internal panorama kaleidescopic contradictory unclear or confused as it may be
7457726 tim pawlenty is like a skipper of a ship thats in rocky seas
7457727 things have gone kind of haywire in the water but somehow hes able to keep a pretty steady level of support among minnesotans during a period when there are some real challenging and a period in which the campaigns are clearly starting to pick up speed and become a little rougher
7457728 what were seeing is that carol molnau would have her hands full in building and enjoying the confidence of minnesotans and of obviously the legislature
7457729 it appears that she would come in as a fairly weak governor and one who will face some real challenges she is not tim pawlenty
7457730 its a position thats a little more behind the scenes so the people of minnesota and i think the poll reflects that theres still a pretty large percentage of minnesotans that dont really have an opinion or dont feel they know her well enough to state
7457731 they are also i think reacting to the fact that weve had two very productive legislative sessions where weve focused on issuers like energy independence the economy jobs education and health care
7457732 and its pretty clear from the poll that minnesotans trust democrats to deal with these issues
7457733 if you took the top 25 to 30 races in the state i think youd see were doing very well
7457734 our polling data shows we are doing well in the races that are competitive
7457735 the national truck driving championships showcase the industrys commitment to safety
7457736 i applaud all the competitors for their efforts in making our highways safe and congratulate dennis for demonstrating how a dedication to safe driving skills can make you a grand champion
7457737 we have identified a strong need for a product of this kind among these businesses and were excited to have the opportunity to provide this robust but affordable solution
7457738 with all the tools needed to begin the move from a pen and paper office to a streamlined digital operation freightbill express will give them the power to excel in todays fast paced trucking industry
7457739 the entrance of these two innovative national carriers into drayage service at our port is the culmination of months of discussion between our team and the motor carrier community regarding our program and the opportunities it can provide to trucking companies that are operationally efficient and environmentally responsible
7457740 the board wants to congratulate port staff on their extensive outreach effort which is now resulting in a critical mass of program participation including these two leading national carriers
7457741 commercial enterprises in the business of providing world class port facilities and services
7457742 i believe that a substantial delay in the implementation of the clean truck program will have dire consequences for the air quality in the area in and around the port for the people who work at the port or live nearby or near the transportation corridors used by trucks serving the port and for the future of the port as an enterprise
7457743 the ata lawsuit directly attacks the ports efforts to dramatically reduce truck related pollution and improve the safety security and efficiency of port operations
7457744 we strongly believe that our plan is lawful and we will vigorously oppose any action that will delay the clean truck program
7457745 it is imperative that pollutants emitted by port sources are immediately and dramatically reduced
7457746 its a 50 percent ratio stone and recycled tires then we mix it with a binding agent a urethane binder its installed two inches thick for new construction or one inch thick over an existing surface
7457747 because its porous and its flexible when you have a heavy rain the fines actually work their way down through it and also when you walk on it or drive on it its like a sponge effect
7457748 this has a heating system underneath it called warm zone and it works on a sensor system
7457749 when the temperature gets below freezing and it senses snow in the air itll automatically kick on
7457750 some stereotype replication and susceptibility to natural ability stereotypes due to an overemphasis on biological determinism and modest recognition of less immediately apparent developmental factors exists
7457751 a complete explanation would include sociological factors such as geography access to individual coaching the costs associated with participation socialisation opportunities the availability of role models and the potential financial rewards in specific sports
7457752 much the same way a microscope can image very small particles this instrument can image very very minute slices of time
7457753 this has become very important in a number of applications in the areas of nuclear energy and biomedical science where you need to capture very brief instances of time and get that data very accurately
7457754 if anyone out there is looking for a career i recommend optics and photonics and getting into lasers
7457755 a table a chair a bowl of fruit and a violin what else does a man need to be happy
7457756 in autopsy studies even on infants there are cardiac changes even under the age of two
7457757 some of it is family history but a lot of it is learned eating habits and patterns of activity
7457758 we are really surprised by that the cardiac risks factors used assessed starting at age 12 then we backed it to age five and now we are going below to age two
7457759 if there is a family history starting at birth and we identify family members who have had heart attack earlier than age 50 and those with elevated cholesterol hypertension obesity if any of those are in place we do begin screening at age two
7457760 its the parents responsibility to set the stage for the childs future health
7457761 we need to rethink what we are doing as parents setting an example for our kids and teach them habits that will follow them throughout their entire life
7457762 the butter containing food and pastries the high fat meats red meats the rich ice creams
7457763 a sixty year old with a cholesterol of 250 isnt bad its very bad in a teenager
7457764 when we get over 250 we get very concerned and get aggressive with nutritional counseling and exercise programs
7457765 we gotta get this shoveling done cant get the car out of the yard so im hoping we dont get anymore do you know anything i dont know
7457766 feel around for lumps bumps tenderness anything along these lines
7457767 there is a lot of responsibility a lot of demands its fast paced and thats what i liked
7457768 so the best bet is to get the baby out of you now
7457769 i noticed i wasnt happy at work i lost my will to do a lot of things that interest me like art and schoolwork i worked very hard during college i was very involved in clubs i noticed that my will to do things just diminished tremendously
7457770 patients with parkinsons disease lack a sufficient amount of dopamine this brain chemical allows us to produce smooth coordinated movements like moving your arm up and down
7457771 there is rigidity which makes it very difficult for the patient to move like theyre moving in a vat of tar there is a resting tremor that is characteristic in one arm or leg
7457772 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured
7457773 there are serious security measures being put in place so as to go about with the planned congress
7457774 the competition will be in self defense sport ju jitsu sparring ground fighting pairs kata demo weapons kata
7457775 we have experts in the sports field who can help us to expand and develop sports in general its never too late we should now turn focus on london 2012
7457776 they organisers gave us cakes and water for breakfast i got hungry with about 10km to run and couldnt push on
7457777 i have competed at all big competitions and i am not worried of the stiff competition in beijing
7457778 some say that males the curetes protected zeuss cradle in crete and that they afterwards came to elis and raised a temple to propitiate cronus
7457779 their names were heracles paeonius epimedes iasius and acesidas heracles having brought wild olive from the hyperboreans the coeval britons to olympia set his younger brothers to run a race there and thus the olympic games originated my underscoring
7457780 originated in a foot race run by girls for the privilege of becoming the priestess of the moon goddess hera and since this event took place in the month of parthenios of the maiden it seems to have been annual
7457781 when zeus married hera when that is a new form of sacred kingship had been introduced into greece by the hellenic achaeans a second foot race was run by young men for the dangerous privilege of becoming the priestesss consort sun to her moon and thus king of elis
7457782 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
7457783 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
7457784 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
7457785 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
7457786 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
7457787 its kill or be killed and you destroy him or he destroys you
7457788 many states have reduced their revenue forecasts some many times
7457789 in a number of states collections are even below the lowered expectations
7457790 will mean less money in the hands of politicians and will give back an average of 3 700 to each of 3 4 million workers and taxpayers in massachusetts not just once but every year
7457791 there are tax cut activists around the country who are very interested in what were doing here
7457792 if it does well we may see copycat initiatives in 2010 and 2012 across the country
7457793 this extreme measure would throw the finances of state and local governments into chaos and inevitably lead to major increases in property and sales taxes
7457794 a cut of this magnitude would severely reduce the ability of the commonwealth to provide the services that citizens and taxpayers have come to expect from their state government
7457795 obviously this is a tough time for the shelter magazine category
7457796 when people do less buying and selling of homes and less remodeling there is less need for the advertising categories that support the businesses to spend their money
7457797 there are many ways you can improve a house whether its 15 for a can of paint or 15 000 for a new bathtub
7457798 consumers have changed the way they think about their homes and about decoration and design and im not sure all the magazines have kept pace with that
7457799 theyve used the oil or gasoline situation to say ok let me see if i can do this
7457800 i think thats the prodding and its who they are in their makeup that they push themselves
7457801 because of the water and because you eat like a horse
7457802 i carry a collapsible baton with me and all you have to do is take a swing at them and theyll stop
7457803 i once had the ones that smell like a baby and a co worker said why does it smell like a babys diaper has been changed in the office
7457804 if i didnt tell my co workers that i ran that day i dont think they would know
7457805 its the extra cup of coffee i had this morning
7457806 its money that i can put into a race entry fee
7457807 i will go back to the hotel and use my polluting car

7457824 we ran in together it was like we tied but they gave me first place
7457825 it was a real good route it was flat and ordinary so i had not problem
7457826 because the artists there were addressing caribbean reality through writing music theatre dance visual arts trying to make sense of the society we live in experimenting taking risks actually thinking
7457827 all that has drained away in recent festivals leaving only the usual suspects performing the usual self satisfied rituals
7457828 the tournament was a great success not only from the organizing stand point but there was a good quality of squash in all of the matches
7457829 it helped some of our young players get exposed to a high quality of squash from some of the top players in the region
7457830 i was also heartened by the willingness of the veterans louis narain selouchinie fung a fat and denise jeffrey to participate despite being absent from competitive squash for such a long time
7457831 the same is expressed to the overseas based players alwyn callender brendon mounter robert mac david who took time out of their schedules to come home and participate

7457838 she was not happy settling for a silver she went full throttle for gold that is the spirit we want to encourage in our schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years but more competition it was wrong because it didnt work it was a tragic mistake in reducing the competitive element in sport in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people the competitive aspect in sport is crucial for success
7457839 it is easy to get the attention of the youths through drama movies and other sorts of entertainment the youths may think they are being entertained but they are also getting the message that you want to put across the soft spoken producer and playwright says
7457840 forum plays are a theme of mass communication i see them as the most important tool in educating the youth in our country about the realities of their generation not forgetting hiv aids
7457841 making films is expensive patience is the driving force of what we do we have to take risks and co operate to develop film production there are some of us who are good at editing writing and making films we all need one another together we can

7457847 if not the biggest its probably among the biggest at this point now that the recall has been extended to include all products from one facility so it is very very significant
7457848 we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be received
7457849 its clear the confidence in maple leaf and our brand has been shaken and i feel very badly about that
7457850 if we fundamentally do the right thing we act in the interest of public health over time i hope that we can rebuild that confidence but that will be for consumers to decide not me
7457851 lesson number one is focus on doing whats right for your customers and consumers and dont focus so much on the accountants and the lawyers
7457852 people are not really that interested in blame people are interested in action this is not about fault its about action and what are we going to do about it because public health is at stake and thats how weve tried to behave
7457853 ill take you to store if you clean the litter boxes

7457859 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

7457874 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids
7457875 i just told her how important this election is to me
7457876 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care

7457918 rumors are not exactly true he came he read for a while and he left then days later we had a meeting with him to talk about his concerns all of which were simple to deal with he wanted to make sure it wasnt too close to the characters hed been playing and we told him it would be our pleasure to differentiate him we all left the meeting smiling and laughing and his agents and the studio started negotiating we just couldnt come up with a mutually satisfactory deal sometimes its s scheduling conflict sometimes its that an actor only wants to agree to be in one movie at a time etc so all i can figure is some one who doesnt know much saw him leave the read early and assumed the rest no hard feelings here
7457919 i cant tell what i will do i will hug him kiss him i cant wait for the moment when i have him next to me talking to me eating with me
7457920 you see them sitting watching the news with wide eyes there is a feeling that not only did he succeed in killing now he is going to continue with his life to build his family
7457921 it was very difficult and so were the days afterwards it re opened the wounds i was mourning again just like it was in the beginning
7457922 my pain is terrible and big but there are other families who suffer and i cant close my eyes or my heart to their feelings
7457923 it was tough they the haran family are from my home town i know everything

7457937 i dont care how bad it hurts this is the olympics and im doing this for america
7457938 the sobering thought is that individuals and societies are not in the end remembered for how they made their money but for how they spent it
7457939 if all economists were laid end to end they would not reach a conclusion
7457940 to be clever enough to get a great deal of money one must be stupid enough to want it
7457941 young people nowadays imagine that money is everything and when they grow older they know it
7457942 when you dont have any money the problem is food when you have money its sex when you have both its health
7457943 i guess somebody found a use for it i was not using it myself
7457944 dear mother i am getting on nicely in my work at the bank and like it i want to find out something about the science of money while i am at it it is an extraordinarily interesting subject
7457945 early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
7457946 a poor person who is unhappy is in a better position than a rich person who is unhappy because the poor person has hope he thinks money would help
7457947 the love of money is the root of all evil
7457948 a banker is a person who lends you an umbrella when the sun shines and asks for it back immediately it starts raining

7457950 housewives spend more money than their husbands make so that other people think their husbands earn more money than they really do
7457951 when you dont have any you only think of money when you have it you still only think of money
7457952 it is better to give than to lend and costs about the same
7457953 people nowadays know the price of everything and the value of nothing
7457954 god bless me with luxury necessities i can do without
7457955 to live like a poor man is only fun when you are rich
7457956 maintaining full employment has become a fetiche its precisely this that is causing jobs to disappear
7457957 thrift a way to spend money without having the least little bit of pleasure from it
7457958 im tired of love im still more tired of rhyme but money gives me pleasure all of the time
7457959 success is a miserable teacher it tempts intelligent people to believe they cannot lose and it is an unreliable guide to the future
7457960 some people spend money that they dont have for things that they dont need to impress people that they dont like
7457961 money means in a thousand minds a thousand subtly different roughly similar systems of images associations suggestions and impulses
7457962 to laugh often and much to win the respect of other people and the affection of children to earn the appreciation of honest critics and to endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty to find the best in others to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child a garden patch or a redeemed social condition to know that even one life has breathed easier because you lived this is to have succeeded
7457963 in our time and culture the battlefield of life is money instead of horses and chariots guns and fortresses there are banks checkbooks credit cards mortgages salaries the tax authorities but the inner enemies remain the same now as they were in ancient india or feudal japan fear self deception vanity egoism wishful thinking tension and violence
7457964 i want to understand what precisely it is in ourselves that prevents great truth from penetrating into our lives and therefore which prevents us from acting ethically in the only real sense of the word ethically means acting and being in the service of what is the true greatness of oneself as man ive studied many aspects of our culture from this perspective science education medecine religion but now i see that in our society in our world it is our relation to money that needs to be understood if great truth does not enter into our relation to money it cannot enter our lives
7457965 i was in the laundry and standing right next to nadal

7457981 we have banned tehreek e taliban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks
7457982 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7457983 an official order has been issued to freeze all bank accounts and assets of taliban militants and their organisations
7457984 as you may be aware we have very few days before the elections it is a fact and lets face the fact here we dont have a leader and we have to identify one now
7457985 we cannot doubt her capacity to discharge the duties of this office as we have been witnesses to her developmental work scattered throughout the country and her leadership at the continental level where she has led her fellow first ladies in the fight against hiv aids
7457986 my strongest appeal to my fellow leaders in government and the ruling party is that we put aside our individual pursuit for leadership and demonstrate to the nation and the world at large that we are not in power for the sake of power
7457987 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7457988 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law
7457989 they fired rockets and entered the house after breaking the main gate they killed our five or six guards and then my elder brother and two nephews
7457990 ive always tried to do the best i can whether in academics sports or whatever
7457991 if i can get into medical school down the road i might
7457992 i hear other kids say their parents make them do their homework but my parents never did i just always wanted to do well at school myself to do well in life
7457993 id like to be a doctor i dont have a specialty chosen but im interested in neurology
7457994 i had great teachers i just loved discussing ideas about the books
7457995 im using facebook to keep in touch with my university roommates who are all over the world
7457996 its something ive always tried my best in with all the support from my parents my family my grandparents its something i enjoy doing
7457997 i check it every day but dont spend a lot of time on it
7457998 i guess its just the way i was brought up my parents didnt push me to do well but they wanted me to do my best
7457999 i want to be a doctor im interested in cardiology but im not too sure
7458000 i only recently started it out of necessity to keep in contact with friends who are going away to university
7458001 partly my parents but for the most part its that i have a dream id like to fulfil thats the reason im working so hard id like to make a difference in the world
7458002 my parents encouraged me i realized i could achieve these marks as long as i worked for them
7458003 i go on facebook whenever i get an email a few times a week
7458004 my parents never forced me to study when i didnt want to and that helped me focus i have a lot of drive i really like to do the best i can i like getting good marks
7458005 ive wanted to become a vet since i was 8 years old
7458006 my brother who has spinal atrophy started going to sledge hockey and i really enjoyed it too
7458007 i dont check it every day maybe twice a week
7458008 when i was younger my parents definitely told me to do my best and after that i got used to doing it and just competed against myself and tried to do better
7458009 id like to be a doctor right now im thinking pediatrics or maybe trying the research side of it
7458010 the three maths were my favourite i like the logic you can always prove if its right
7458011 its something i naturally have if i want something i try as hard as i can to go out and get it
7458012 im hoping to become an actuary at an insurance company and beyond that work my way up in the company into management
7458013 i probably go on every day but not that long i use it to keep in touch or if i have school work to catch up on i ask on facebook
7458014 my parents always told me i can be anything i want and if i put effort into it i can do anything i want to achieve i always used to make goals for myself in grade 9 i wanted a 90 average in grade 10 91 it went up by one or two per cent each year i jumped a bit this year
7458015 ill probably further my studies and get a ph d
7458016 a lot of alternative stuff but i like almost anything
7458017 definitely my parents they pushed me a lot but not in a bad way it wasnt so much do well in school or else but they were always really proud and made me put school ahead of everything else
7458018 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7458019 you know i lost i lost big time in boston

7458022 you need a certain amount of money to be happy
7458023 in den letzten zehn jahren wurden im bereich der fahrzeuggetriebe bedeutend gr ere messbare und vom kunden wahrnehmbare fortschritte erzielt als in den 50 jahren zuvor
7458024 it was a great way to get our season started
7458025 our kids attacked well tonight and really came out and played a great first match
7458026 my biggest focus in my life right now is my family
7458027 i enjoy being a dad a husband and a friend and just hanging out with my kids and going to the park just everything like that
7458028 they always tell me just come on back it cant be that great
7458029 but i say man if you get up here and you experience this and hang out for a couple days youll see what i mean
7458030 when i used to work in corrections i always worked two to midnight or four to midnight
7458031 my kids would call me at work and say hey guess what i scored a soccer goal dad guess what i did this i did that
7458032 but i wasnt there and i just didnt want to see my kids through pictures i want to be involved as much as possible in my kids lives
7458033 i tell people all the time and this is no knock on all the great stories of people pursuing their nfl careers but it was just never really something that i had to do or pursue
7458034 i grew up with a mom and a dad not having a college education or even finishing high school so my job for my parents was to go to school and get a good education
7458035 i watched the nfl growing up i was a big dallas cowboys fan
7458036 its tough to say in any kind of significant way how it affected me
7458037 you just know it wasnt the same as far as being crisp on certain things because everything i did i had to do on my own not being able to practice
7458038 i basically just kept in shape by playing basketball but that was it i always studied the playbook that was always around and i could always go watch practice but as far as getting the timing down with the quarterback and stuff like that it probably hindered me in becoming as good as i thought i could have been
7458039 you have to understand not only did he have two and a half years away from football but when he came back he played an entirely different position
7458040 like any position in any sport there are little intricacies of the position that can only be acquired after repetition you have to get a volume of work to begin to master a skill and he just didnt really have that much time
7458041 coming into his senior year there was no doubt that he was the no 1 recruit in the city of memphis and most likely in the state of tennessee based on his junior year
7458042 he had a highlight film from his junior year that was just incredible
7458043 wed sit down watching and just laugh at some of the plays he made i can remember one play where he was the punter and they snapped the ball 15 yards over his head and he goes back picks it up and runs through 11 guys to score a touchdown it looked like something out of a video game
7458044 i just always had so much respect for him because he got knocked down so many times between his senior year and when he finally got the opportunity to play
7458045 but he never quit theres hundreds of stories of kids who didnt qualify for college on that first round out of high school and who just faded into oblivion and god only knows what happened to them a lot of them are tragic stories
7458046 i think he was committed to us and he was committed to making a better life for himself and he was mature enough and sensible enough to see that this was his best shot at getting a better life for himself
7458047 and im just so happy that it did work out that way that he stuck to his plan when other people tried to see it only through an athletic lens he had the broader view of what his life was going to be all about and he fought and followed through on it
7458048 it wasnt about going somewhere else because this happened to me i was going to play at iowa
7458049 when you look back on your volume of work you have that upper shelf
7458050 every young man we ever talked to in terms of recruiting we sat there with the young man and his parents and we laid out a plan that plan was to graduate and to get an education and to make the most of their athletic experience
7458051 so when you get a casey wiegmann or a mike goff or a ross verba all those guys that i sat in their homes and they achieved the athletic end of it thats kind of more recognized because you see those guys on sunday playing for so long
7458052 the less publicized kids like willie guy as a coach those are every bit as rewarding because their long term future was built there or finished there at the university of iowa they equipped themselves with the tools necessary to go out and live the rest of their lives as successful people and how could you feel any better than that for a person
7458053 when i take my kids to the park or whatever the case may be everybody moms and dads who are at the park are there for the same reasons im there for which is to play with the kids and fly the kites
7458054 nobody is in the corner shooting dice nobody is drinking beer its just a different culture fights arent going to break out now it could happen but im going to take my chances here
7458055 growing up in the inner city its really and truly about choices
7458056 ive seen it affect my family members cousins aunts uncles
7458057 ive never ever passed judgment on people ive always tried to respect people for what they are and what they are about
7458058 the difference for me is how i choose to live my life after school versus when i grew up in the inner city
7458059 having three kids i wanted to provide for them i wanted the best for them and i wanted to put them in a place that i felt safe
7458060 we ate and then we all walked around the pond when we got done
7458061 i took the little man in the stroller it was a beautiful night the weather was gorgeous
7458062 this is what life is about it isnt about hanging out all night long this is really what its all about if you dont hang in bad places bad things arent going to happen to you
7458063 with the coming festivities and holiday season olympus malaysia is confident of chalking up strong earnings for 2008
7458064 from april to june of our 2008 2009 fiscal year we achieved rm27 5 million in sales
7458065 all companies like to be in the black i guess moving forward we have to focus on this
7458066 we are still keen to proceed with this transaction and we are in discussions with the various parties to find a solution
7458067 i think we are all working within the context of the current share sale agreement a lot of the discussions both with bapepam and temasek are about finding a way how we can move forward
7458068 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7458069 a wall of ice coming towards us and we were carried 200 metres
7458070 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7458071 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7458072 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7458073 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7458074 this isnt the first accident and it wont be the last
7458075 im too smart busy to waste my time doing that

7458088 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7458089 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7458090 siamo al corrente della situazione ma per il momento non siamo in grado di fornire spiegazioni
7458091 i might not have all the answers i wouldnt have it any other way
7458092 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7458093 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7458094 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7458095 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7458096 hello ms im very sorry but ive just received my electricity bill and it doesnt seem to be correct really sorry to bother you
7458097 thats ok could you please give me the bill number your address your date of birth date you last cried blood type hair and eye colour and your mothers maiden name please just to check your details
7458098 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7458099 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7458100 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7458101 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7458102 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7458103 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7458104 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7458105 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7458106 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7458107 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7458108 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7458109 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7458110 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7458111 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7458112 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7458113 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7458114 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the big screen would be amazing
7458115 it would take doctor who to the next level the show has a worldwide appeal so should be very successful
7458116 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7458117 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7458118 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7458119 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7458120 taking the financial debate out of equation what gets me out of bed in the morning really excited as i do thinking wow i cant believe ive got the chance to do this today and go and do it with some verve and with a smile on my face
7458121 if someone asked me what my dream job would be thats it if i was retired and a multi millionaire what would i want to do id want to go and win the tour de france
7458122 i will lose one or two because they are the best in the world
7458123 im experiencing a lot of strange emotions at the moment one moment you think one thing then another but im pretty loyal and loyalty is something i get from others
7458124 that win and this tournament is more special than any championship that any of us will ever win
7458125 i am so excited i have been waiting for this for four years and now its finally here
7458126 after i got into foul trouble early i played a little cautious but in the fourth quarter coach mike krzyewski told me to let the momma loose
7458127 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7458128 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7458129 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7458130 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40

7458185 ayat ini menjelaskan mengapa seseorang diijinkan memiliki hubungan senggama dengan gadis gadis budak selain istri istri mereka dan tidak ada pembatasan atas jumlah mereka
7458186 shariah membuat aturan aturan ini mengingat kondisi manusia dan persyaratan bagi kemudahan manusia
7458187 jadi ayat ini jelas menetapkan bahwa orang boleh melakukan hubungan sexual dengan budak wanita sebagaimana dengan istri dasarnya adalah kepemilikian dan bukan perkawinan
7458188 itu berarti wanita wanita tersebut yang menjadi tahanan perang sementara suami suami mereka ditinggalkan di zona perang tidak haram karena hubungan perkawinan mereka putus akibat fakta bahwa mereka masuk darul islam

7458219 they make stupid comments about kids to feel better about themselves they pretend to be your friend and then stab you in the back
7458220 im going to school to pay attention to my studies and learn
7458221 a 7 year old might be afraid of thunderstorms and snakes
7458222 by the time you get to middle school its social situations that can be a trigger high schoolers tend to be more anxious about things related to current events their career choices and who they can rely on to help them make decisions
7458223 i keep thinking about how people dont pay attention when theyre driving
7458224 i dont want to choose something and end up not liking it when you make a decision you cant go back
7458225 i worry theyre going to take out orchestra or band
7458226 thats how a lot of kids stay out of trouble you keep busy
7458227 children are very perceptive about changes in their family environment
7458228 if parents are fighting more or even if there are subtle changes like the family is going out to dinner less often kids certainly pick up on that
7458229 so long as the child knows their parents are going to be asking about these things every day and they can express what theyre feeling its less likely a problem will fester over time
7458230 the effect of this recession on the las vegas local customer has been worse than on the average gaming customer
7458231 its not going to get better anytime soon given these two forces at work
7458232 the system of higher education currently employs 1 328 people who are paid 100 000 or more annually
7458233 i cannot help but wonder how many nevadans would support an income tax or any increased taxes for that matter to sustain those salary levels in the face of significant government spending reductions in other areas
7458234 the chancellor stated he did not understand the governors policy when it comes to financial responsibility
7458235 there are going to be some difficult choices that have to be made and were not going to make them without explaining those decisions to the people of nevada if thats seen as more aggressive so be it
7458236 confirmed every one of my fears and concerns it is apparent that in your desire to reduce the size of government you have no problem sacrificing education

7458238 im not offended by anything he says im troubled by what he says
7458239 my work deals with the transient nature of las vegas from the unending construction to the spectacle of implosion i am interested in this citys ability to constantly reinvent itself and its reinterpretation of an american utopia
7458240 a bunch of my artist friends get together once a week for bowling and have been doing so for six months now
7458241 it seemed that there had been something drawing me here for a long time everything is so ridiculous and over the top theres the ability to meet people from all walks of life from all over the world in the span of an hour the big ancient city rules dont apply here and the amount of possibilities seemed endless
7458242 the constant construction muted colors desolation and sordid history have all been present in my work
7458243 most recently i have been inspired by the efforts to save and restore vegas past i meet people from all over the united states when they visit the neon museums boneyard and they are always stating that they wish that their city was doing half of what vegas is doing to save history it is something that isnt talked about much so i have been trying to point it out in my newer work
7458244 i have benefited extensively from the generosity of the las vegas community but i have noticed in las vegas there are a lot of talking heads that find themselves on npr discussing the lack of art community and the struggle to keep artists from leaving but i seem to never find them at an art opening or artists lectures it is genuinely disheartening
7458245 after installation and ribbon cutting i will be moving with my boyfriend aaron to philadelphia most likely next spring

7458257 well its true when i was younger i didnt care about things as much as i do now but thats not to say i regret anything maybe at one time i did but i dont have any regrets now i just think that as i get older i finally have become what i should have been all along

7458265 we are not handicappers on our side of the counter
7458266 were bookmakers and we move the line according to how the money comes in we respect las vegas sports consultants figures immensely but sometimes the market value isnt there the market is a huge key in what we put up as a number

7458268 we nemen drie geiten mee in de grot twee om te slachten voor de groep toeristen en de derde binden we vast aan een paaltje bij de ingang het luipaard komt en houdt de hele nacht de wacht in de ochtend laten we de geit los die dan wegrent als de kat honger heeft eet hij de geit als hij dat niet doet danken we de natuur en nemen de geit weer mee die wordt dan vetgemest en later geslacht voor de vrouwen en kinderen want vrouwen en kinderen zijn het meest waardevol in het leven

7458330 im satisfied she isnt putting herself at risk so im happy for her to continue
7458331 the newer one was the more painful and looks quite recent
7458332 it has been a worrying time for her because she didnt want to let people down
7458333 i travel a lot thats why it looks a bit used
7458334 so you must earn a lot of money to afford all these trips
7458335 i remember doing one of my first opening spots at the up the creek venue in london and seeing a really really slick stand up doing 20 minutes
7458336 i thought to myself i just could never do that i couldnt be ultra confident
7458337 but i wanted to be the opposite of that and just be disastrous
7458338 it was all of my leave for the year but comedy is an antidote to civvy street
7458339 working incredibly hard the previous year and didnt have much of a social life
7458340 i thought itd be 250 quid and a bit of a laugh but then i won the bbcs competition for new comedy talent
7458341 my first year was amazing and i thought id just carry on
7458342 quite how someone can be so hilarious without any actual jokes is sheer genius
7458343 if you look at the if com award nominees they were all slick and im the opposite of that
7458344 the judges were all senior critics from the fringe and to be given an award by them is astonishing really
7458345 it was a great thing i care about it an awful lot and i was very pleased to get it
7458346 ive worked on last years show all this year at the hen and chickens venue in london and now i have a final version
7458347 what ive been doing is almost down to the minute what i want from an hour long show
7458348 i think what ive achieved this year is to prove to myself that i can do a professional show and that makes a big difference

7458359 its a wonder just to have gray hair to live that long
7458360 everywhere you look were sold the promise that if youre beautiful your life will be better
7458361 is it possible the beauty promise is a lie just plain and simple propaganda
7458362 if we lived in a society without so much advertising people would see thousands of different things as beautiful
7458363 because were being fed so many images all the time were being told that the same image is beautiful
7458364 i thought how stupid is it to throw your life away over a beautiful woman
7458365 and then i thought have i ever done anything stupid for a beautiful woman
7458366 for me to be on such a rise to success and for it to stop because i was a size 4 it was just hard for me i just wanted to go back to the way things were
7458367 im trying to get curvaceous like beyonc and j lo because thats pretty

7458372 theyre trying to duplicate something thats a facade thats not real its a fantasy
7458373 i wanted to give the message that obsessing over beauty can be harmful to you

7458419 we are looking forward to seeing a wide a range of designers on the runway showing everything from couture gowns to designer street wear and to compliment this we are pleased to be offering mastercard promotions designed to assist the cardholder in accessing a little luxury too
7458420 with the demand for luxury goods and services in asia pacific estimated to grow an average of 12 percent per year between 2006 and 2016 businesses need to understand the needs of these consumers and their distinctively different demand characteristics in order to succeed
7458421 in hong kong alone the discretionary spend of the affluent is set to grow more than 73 percent to 17 billion in 2015 and their spend on luxury goods and fashionable experiences is a key part of their expenditure
7458422 likewise china is another market whose affluent consumers are expected to be the worlds largest luxury goods consumers in the next decade according to mastercard research in 2006 alone spending on luxury goods in china was up by 50 percent this clearly shows that domestically the new wealth in mainland chinas major cities is powering spending lifestyle choices and mindset changes among affluent consumers

7458440 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7458441 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7458442 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7458443 the turkish state seems to be very afraid of their citizens learning how dangerous nuclear power is that is why authorities do not tolerate any protest
7458444 we are seriously concerned about the denial of freedom of speech in turkey
7458445 its a fact that biden has a consistent record against turkey in congress but its also a fact that he knows turkey and turkeys leaders quite well
7458446 as a result i think its better to deal with someone with a deep knowledge of turkey than another person who is ignorant about turkey
7458447 i dont think such a build up will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7458448 this is a routine port visit and exercises that were planned a long time ago
7458449 a u s frigate is going to join later this week i understand
7458450 turkeys membership will bring a new dimension to the european integration and the eu
7458451 we want to send a signal that turkey is involved with europe and is part of it
7458452 we also wanted to foster cultural dialogue with a muslim country we thought it was interesting to come to a muslim country as a jewish organization
7458453 the jewish community has a very high assimilation rate across the whole of europe and there might not be a jewish identity left in a few generations so we want to bring together young jewish people to meet and pride themselves in this common heritage
7458454 we had to get off the bus and walk finally they let the traffic run when i looked back i saw that an ambulance was moving at the same pace as us
7458455 the precautions taken for ahmadinejad were extraordinary none of this was made for the others even for bush
7458456 it is possible to implement an alternative and effective plan when such visits are made an alternative solution could be to use sea transportation ahmadinejad could have been taken to ra an palace by sea however leaders do like being public figures i dont think they would prefer moving around so mysteriously
7458457 perhaps another alternative way could be to open up emergency lanes on the streets helping to facilitate the traffic and maintain security at the same time
7458458 istanbuls air traffic is open for this kind of transportation in fact we have carried a lot of bureaucrats and even formula 1 directors using vip helicopters
7458459 i think the worst part of it was the fact that people didnt know about the blockage it should have been announced before i lived in dubai in the late 90s the day george bush was visiting dubai was announced as a public holiday
7458460 anyone can sue the istanbul governorship or the interior ministry over what happened but i do not think they would win the case
7458461 it is the duty of the state to protect a president and we cannot measure the level of security that is necessary to provide that
7458462 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers
7458463 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7458464 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7458465 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates
7458466 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers

7458495 we are definitely disappointed by australia because they have not toured us for 10 years naghmi said
7458496 australia have a commitment of playing five one day internationals in april next year so we hope by then their fears are removed and they play in our country said naghmi of australia who have not toured pakistan since 1998
7458497 in sail momentum players need to note the rs 155 level which is likely to be a minor resistance it is almost there what i would feel very confident about buying for short term to medium term would be a consistent trade above the rs 155 levels volume is picking up open interest also goes up telling that trader commitment is actually pretty gung ho on this counter so i would venture out a buy above the rs 155 levels especially volumes and open interest show expansion
7458498 on the downside rs 117 120 band would be a floor support below which i dont expect the counter to go into short term to medium term so going with an investment strategy sure you can buy but dont commit all your funds at this point in time you may need to have average somewhat as long as it remains above the rs 115 levels which you can use as a stoploss a six quarter timeframe thats one and a half year timeframe is rs 210 levels
7458499 dish tv merits a hold at this point in time for a higher risk appetite in short to medium term players because right now its showing some life and momentum on the upside the support is clearly at rs 32 levels below which the short term trend is likely to get fractured on the upside the stock has a potential to test rs 45 level should the market scenario remain conducive one can book profits at closer to rs 44 or rs 45 levels
7458500 we have seen declines that have spanned over a few quarters in tata motors and this stock is now very close to a rs 375 intermediate medium term support base and unless this is violated i think the stock has done on the sell side on the upside the first resistance level would be rs 490 or rs 495 should this stock actually manage to break out above rs 490 495 with very heavy volumes and thereafter manage to trade above it consistently the worst would be clearly over and the stock would actually start to go on an upward trajectory till then it merits a long term hold and should it go down marginally but remain above rs 375 i would even venture out a long term buy on this counter
7458501 the present study shows the superiority of yoga over physical activity in improving the cognitive functions that could be attributed to emphasis on correctness in breathing synchronizing breathing with body movements relaxation and mindful rest
7458502 a total of 42 more villas will be constructed on the outskirts of munzur mountains for now
7458503 we have first prepared the infrastructure of the project and then started to build these villas we have removed the painful memories of the terror incidents which engulfed the region in the previous years via this project
7458504 villas rise on the land which was previously remembered with regrettable terrorist incidents duplex villas are sold at ytl 200 000 while triplex villas are sold at ytl 300 000
7458505 we have managed to provide revenues for our municipality and sought to remove the scars of terror by means of this villa project these villas have altered the silhouette of our town
7458506 it means we can appeal to people who are disillusioned with traditional church
7458507 the flip side is the uncertainty has meant weve seen people we otherwise wouldnt have seen who have come along because they are asking the big questions about life
7458508 there needs to be a spiritual reality there especially in the current very tough times
7458509 many people who spend their whole life just focusing on just making money begin to question what is the meaning of life why am i doing that
7458510 i know one or two members of the congregation who are going through difficult times or redundancies themselves so its a great support for them
7458511 from a biblical perspective you realize there is a higher authority despite the economic uncertainty of today
7458512 ive been in the financial industry for more than 20 years and the pressure on employees has increased probably every year

7458515 employees were banned from smoking in the facility as of 2008 in order to increase service quality
7458516 smokers harm not only themselves but people around them they walk with smoke over their head nobody wants such a person to serve them with a decision that we made in the beginning of 2008 most of our staff quit smoking and most of them are trying to do it our condition for new employees is that they be nonsmokers
7458517 this condition sometimes gets us into difficulty but we dont think of giving it up
7458518 and this has nothing to do with the fact that i am a member of the akp
7458519 cannot there exist an utterance of the word wine and the acronym akp together at the same time indeed are they paradoxical
7458520 what i say is not that the two the wine and the akp should come side by side but there is no such idea that the two are oxymoronic

7458524 any time an attraction opens attendance inevitably is going to slide from your opening year
7458525 were trying to make sure people dont feel theyve seen everything at the aquarium
7458526 when i look at this i think of who would be eating off of these pieces and it really helps me to connect to the titanic on a personal level
7458527 we believe it tells the story in a more accurate and compelling way by conserving them
7458528 the most striking details of the campaigns data were obtained from small fishing boats
7458529 the result is that the mediterranean sea is giving us an sos signal
7458530 these wastes have constantly been increasing which damages natural balances if the mediterranean dies then the land dies
7458531 species are becoming extinct nutrition chains have been broken excessive pollution has been coupled with rapidly increasing algae at the sea bottom
7458532 a large amount of the fish caught in this way is thrown back into the sea as they are dead
7458533 big fishing boats catch 75 percent of all fish and small boats catch the rest
7458534 our campaigns should be seen as and called social advertisement campaigns
7458535 we openly tell the pkk to disregard arms as a means to obtain rights but of course there is a societal reality kurds will react to policies based on a denial of their identity and their cultural demands
7458536 as long as the state does not change those policies it cannot reduce the influence of the pkk on people you can not make the pkk believe that arms are unnecessary
7458537 we must act in such a way as to make even the pkk think of the turkish republic as its own country and see that it must act accordingly in face of a new approach without this logic forging a common dialogue and drawing a roadmap has been impossible
7458538 we tell pkk that they will achieve nothing even if they fight for five more years
7458539 only democratization and increased civilian power in turkey can accomplish a final settlement of the kurdish problem
7458540 politicians in turkey have always compromised themselves to elites who think of themselves as masters of the state
7458541 if the dtp is closed down kurds will perceive themselves to be unwanted people and this will aggravate the impasse the dtp is an expression of a mission it is insistent upon the democratic solution to the kurdish problem government and the state must look for dialogue and compromise if not a disregarded dtp will not have a chance to influence the kurds
7458542 the court did not shut off the akp and we are happy for it but now the akp must pass the law that became the subject of the closure case it cannot ignore others after it is saved
7458543 we do not have the slightest concern for diyarbak r we will be stronger than we were in last years local elections
7458544 we have significant vote potential in zmir that may change the fate of zmir this may have an impact on the municipality we will come up with a formula
7458545 the chp is never a social democratic party today the chp is a chauvinist nationalist and racist party the chp has a narrowly nationalistic view of the problem and denies kurds identity and culture
7458546 we need to look under the mountain to reveal the ergenekon gang in its full extent
7458547 we do not think that companies that raised difficulties to pharmacists during the application of discount for public institutions will exchange available medicines with new bar coded medicines we will be aggrieved by this
7458548 monday is the last day for our value added tax vat declarations however we still invoice prescriptions of july due to defects of provision system we both make out an invoice and the system cannot overcome system cannot both print invoice and correcting it only after 6 oclock in the evening we can work on these invoices
7458549 however medicine monitoring system will give different identity numbers for each medicine so provision system should work regularly
7458550 if the target is to find fake medicine boxes medicine depots put their own signs on them in this way we know which depot the medicine belongs to
7458551 fake labels worth ytl 2 cause cancellation of contracts with the state for six months to a year we want to remove unjust treatment against our colleagues we support medicine monitoring system to remove both fake medicine and package forgery
7458552 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to obtain that objective
7458553 the economy could hardly have remained immune from such severe financial disruptions
7458554 more explicit is certainly feasible and would be a useful step toward a more systemic orientation for financial regulation and supervision
7458555 given the corporations financing power and its planned expansion strategy further growth corresponding with the growth rates in the region can be expected
7458556 theyre trying to take advantage of what they perceive is value in a high quality european retail portfolio
7458557 liberty international has one of the best if not the best
7458558 the stake building should be taken seriously and underpins our view that u k property stocks own generally high quality assets with long term value creation prospects
7458559 will travel to israel and the palestinian territories on august 24
7458560 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress towards the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7458561 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travellers
7458562 in order to avoid a well publicized provocation in the middle of the sea
7458563 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7458564 the arrival of the two ships after this adventure represents a big breakthrough in the wall of the israeli siege imposed on gaza
7458565 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7458566 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7458567 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7458568 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected
7458569 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7458570 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7458571 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7458572 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7458573 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7458574 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7458575 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7458576 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7458577 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7458578 we have hoped that obama would have chosen another politician
7458579 obamas policy on iraq is ambiguous and the choice of this person leads us to be more worried
7458580 i think that obama chose him because he has wide knowledge and experience in the foreign issues and politics but regarding iraq biden has limited knowledge because of his proposal to divide iraq
7458581 i think that biden if he becomes vice president will not have a big influence regarding the map of iraq because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7458582 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7458583 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7458584 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7458585 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7458586 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7458587 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7458588 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7458589 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources
7458590 but the task is immense even with all the money in the world it would still take time
7458591 there is certainly a very fierce competition in the short term which is going to actually see the balance sheets bleed dish tv in the first quarter reported a loss of rs 125 crore we have sun tv in this dth play tata sky reliance has launched bharti and videocon are planning to come so the competition is going to be very fierce in the short term and it is going to see the company in the losses for a couple of more quarters
7458592 the total size of this industry the number of households having cable tv connectivity stands at about 8 crore households and the number having dth services is just about 75 lakh so 90 is in favor of cable tv and 10 is in the actual favor of dth the number of dth subscribers is going to double in the next 7 years and by 2015 we are expecting at least 15 crore households having either cable tv or dth dth will garner at least 50 of the household market by 2015 so here i am talking about a rs 7 5 crore being dth subscribers and the current size is just 75 lakh so its a 10 fold growth but over a seven year period so if one has a long term time frame in the mind then one is going to make decent amounts of profits by the investment but in the short term the stock could maybe go up to rs 45 or rs 50 and be in that range but if one has got a 3 5 year time frame i am looking at over rs 100 for this stock
7458593 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7458594 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7458595 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7458596 we must intensify our work to win membership in the european security system and strengthen the defence capabilities of our country
7458597 anyone who cares about ukraine must openly declare that entry into the euro atlantic security system is the only way to protect the lives and ensure the well being of our families children and grandchildren
7458598 ukraine will do everything to prevent any military escalation in our region
7458599 i share a deep empathy with all the suffering people of the indivisible georgian land your pain is in our hearts
7458600 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
7458601 few views are unwelcome on the pages of the tdn
7458602 the views expressed above are the authors own and do not reflect the views of the tdn
7458603 i have watched with interest your coverage of armenia and armenian turkish affairs
7458604 chris hoy thinks that the day chris hoy refers to chris hoy in the third person is the day that chris hoy disappears up his own arse
7458605 it is only natural that we have to maintain a delicate balance between our commitments to our nato allies and our neighbor
7458606 according to the figures of 2008 russia is now are biggest trade partner we cant ignore that
7458607 a show of solidarity with georgia through natos military means would have not help defuse the tension to the contrary it would have aggravated the situation
7458608 i have been told that there is an american who has set up a site for people visiting ithaca among other special attractions for a visitor he claims is that you can pick pieces from the palace of odysseus and take back to your country
7458609 if the culture ministry does not give money we will find the money if they do not expropriate the land we will buy it
7458610 there is over consumption in luxury in turkey but it will come back to its normal level
7458611 we have projects such as opening a fashion tv cafe similar to those in new york monte carlo and paris companies will introduce small fashion displays for the a plus consumers
7458612 we have been having water shortage for the past two years right now we drink water from the wells we dug but we dont know whether this water is safe or not
7458613 only people with donkeys can fetch their water but lots of families dont have donkeys they have to carry their water on their backs if the situation does not improve we will have to immigrate we will have to leave the land where we were born
7458614 we cannot take a bath we cannot clean our houses and neither can we wash clothes since we have to carry our water on our backs we cant sleep at night because of our back problems
7458615 there are environmentalists all around the world these people are engaged in such activities during their spare time
7458616 50 to 60 people demonstrate they get the media support and an image is created as if entire turkey is demonstrating
7458617 demonstrators were only 50 60 people what they say is not important at all because they are a marginal small group
7458618 respect to spain they were unbelievable we had a game plan and they countered with incredible plays the game was never over im watching the game all over again in my head it will go down in history as one of the greatest
7458619 ive always been able to step up and make big shots when the lights are brightest
7458620 i just needed to be put in the position to do it
7458621 everyone talks about arrogant nba players but what you saw was us facing adversity and bonding together
7458622 it was a strange moment after losing the game we had to put it in perspective and think we really didnt lose the gold medal we won the silver
7458623 in kenya we have many medals but im glad to have this one too
7458624 a gold medal in the olympics is a huge victory for us
7458625 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys got a good taste of whats important in life we were crushed by that
7458626 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7458627 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7458628 economic and social areas have been a lot affected while all these developments were happening however besides the changes when we take a look at many of the world countries at our country and the lives of our public we see that our needs problems and wishes did not changed in essence
7458629 the climate in marmaris is almost the same as beijing the conditions here are perfect and our players have gained the best performance they may have we invited the worlds number one wheelchair coach aad zwaan for our players and he gave us a lot he had very positive impacts on our two players and now they have a strong belief for the future
7458630 we want to represent our country in the best way getting a high level success will also depend on the draws
7458631 i work hard for international grades in the olympics and world championships all this is for being a good model for other disabled people in the future
7458632 turkey has failed to send any normal tennis players to the olympics this makes our wheelchair players success more important to everybody winning or losing in paralympics are not important for us being there is quite enough for the team now we have to promote wheelchair tennis in turkey and it is time for disabled to go to the courts
7458633 because of bureaucracy windmills could not be condemned and taken under protection until now we will change the deplorable situation of the windmills with our projects municipalities have also started working for condemnation
7458634 the windmills protected for 400 years by our grandfathers and ancestors and which make the flour and bread of the peninsula until 40 years ago are now in a deplorable situation our municipalities in bodrum urgently started working for condemnation endeavors
7458635 as soon as we solve the bureaucratic problems we will condemn the windmills at least the ones visited every day and bring them into cultural tourism again for the restoration of the historical windmills that have an important role in peoples lives since the establishment of antique bodrum city both as a foundation and through advocating with the municipalities we will provide each municipality to renovate at least three of them
7458636 we have applied to the treasury four years ago with our project for restoration preparation of a beautiful excursion spot place and a countryside coffee shop but we could not receive a response to our application yet we are also willing to provide the protection and safekeeping of our historical and cultural properties we are frequently trying to clean the windmills and keep them clean with the facilities of municipality
7458637 i have been coming to bodrum for 20 years and bringing and guiding wealthy and famous tourists i dont want to bring those tourists back without showing the eight historical windmills located in the place where you can see the best view of bodrum but i dont know what to say when i see the deplorable situation of the windmills
7458638 i dont understand why you dont protect your history and keep these areas clean this picture really doesnt fit to bodrum sometimes i change the tour route in order not to show tourists this unpleasant view
7458639 i wouldnt recommend buying sail at the current juncture or any other commodity stock i mean the steel stocks this companies arent likely to benefit because they arent likely to hike prices obviously because of the government intervention and elections likely to be held about 6 or 9 months from here i think these companies will not be in a position one can look at tata steel which has a exposure to international markets via corus but certainly not sail because the government wouldnt like these companies to hike prices especially with inflation at 12 5 in fact there are plenty of opportunities get into some debt free companies companies with huge cash or companies with mnc parent that is where the space one needs to look at rather than at this point of time in this metal space so one can certainly go in for those companies
7458640 help or else give up your vacation time or get a black mark in your work unit file
7458641 help or else give up your vacation time or get a black mark in your work unit file
7458642 i believe it is only a matter of time before papers will either reduce their circulation by eliminating areas where the cost exceeds the cover price or increase the cover price to match the costs
7458643 any number of papers in north america have done this already
7458644 look at the almost national post theyve been pulling out of high cost areas for years major metros in the u s have been doing the same canwest has quietly been increasing the home delivery rates outside their core markets to reflect the rising costs of fuel and labour
7458645 being among the hard working chinese people seeing the volunteers show up at the arena every day with big smiles on their faces that just made us want to go out and play even harder
7458646 it was the moment ive been dreaming about for four years now i already had bronze around my neck and i wanted gold to finally get it it feels great we hadnt won in eight years and had been doubted we showed its not about the names on the backs of our shirts but the three letters on the front
7458647 its more important and more special than any championship any of us will ever win
7458648 winning an nba championship cant compare to winning a gold medal for your country
7458649 being among the hard working chinese people seeing the volunteers show up at the arena every day with big smiles on their faces that just made us want to go out and play even harder
7458650 it was the moment ive been dreaming about for four years now i already had bronze around my neck and i wanted gold to finally get it it feels great we hadnt won in eight years and had been doubted we showed its not about the names on the backs of our shirts but the three letters on the front
7458651 its more important and more special than any championship any of us will ever win
7458652 winning an nba championship cant compare to winning a gold medal for your country
7458653 this is why i have to schedule out six hours to watch a ninety minute movie
7458654 oh it wasnt that great theres these astronauts or miners or whatever and they find this weird spaceship one of them gets this thing stuck on his face but then hes ok but then a monster explodes out of his chest during dinner and theyre trying to kill the monster and one of the astronauts turned out to be a robot it wasnt that great
7458655 mashhadani left al hussein medical centre on sunday night after treatment he was in good health
7458656 if parliament and iranian officials agree caspian projects could be done in the form of production sharing contracts because of their high costs

7458659 we need a financial mechanism to create incentives for countries to conserve their forests and natural resources
7458660 to give them an alternative to cutting down their forests
7458661 as far as i am concerned we have not benefited from the forest apart from employment opportunities for a few of our young men

7458668 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions coming out all at once i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am
7458669 it was mature and astute shes become her own person call it a coming of age
7458670 the french have been so dominant to stick half a second into them its amazing
7458671 our friendship has been so dominant in the last few years as part of a team you cant let anyone down
7458672 i havent won any international races before but we knew beforehand we could do it
7458673 coach jurgen grobler kept telling us no one could beat us but sometimes it was hard to believe him
7458674 we were on the ropes and we put together the best finish weve ever had
7458675 i had to play it safe i couldnt play silly beggars and go chasing world records
7458676 after the kilo was dropped there were parts of me thinking that it could be the end of my individual career but to come back to win a different event altogether is just fantastic it really is
7458677 our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
7458678 im in a bit of a daze national anthem flag its a dream come true
7458679 to me thats what sport is about its those pressure moments thats what i love about competing
7458680 everyone in sailing knows hes a legend hes so young still and he has yet to do more i wouldnt be surprised if he surpassed sir steve redgrave in my lifetime hes the most special sailor weve seen
7458681 i havent got the reaction that id imagined that id have
7458682 we were just rattling around it was so smooth it felt easy to be honest we knew it was fast but 3 53 314 we just cant believe it thats going to go down in history that time wont be broken in a long time were the best team in the world
7458683 i dont really care what people think or say they can say what they like i have come here and got what i wanted and im happy
7458684 shes level headed and surrounded by good people she will keep her feet on the ground she has had her trials and tribulations and she knows how to treat it
7458685 an inspiration to the british cycling team and an inspiration to british sport in general chris hoy for superman yes
7458686 chriss performances at the beijing olympics were simply outstanding and he deserves every recognition i can think of no better way of marking his historic success than by naming scotlands only world class track cycling facility after him
7458687 ive wanted this so badly id beaten everyone in the field so there was a lot pressure on me to win a medal im the golden girl of the track
7458688 im paid to win gold medals lets win em all
7458689 i felt good this morning i knew we could do it i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt its been a killer four years and it feels great to put it behind us
7458690 he was tough horrible and strong throughout the bout but im olympic champion its unbelievable
7458691 the team sprint was hard to watch the guys put in a phenomenal ride it was a shame i couldnt be part of team but im delighted today i cant put it into words
7458692 i believe if we did it again we could do it i want to go back to the start and try again we let it slip away at the end it was 100 from everyone but we didnt quite get it right
7458693 you turn up at the olympics and finish second and you think you know im really very good
7458694 we didnt talk at all out there were best friends we train together and we just kind of knew when to kick at the right time
7458695 im so excited the way he has jumped feels great the horse is really young and im really pleased with him as he has never seen anything like this before
7458696 it was very disappointing not to get the gold extremely disappointing not to get the silver but you never pass up an olympic medal im just delighted
7458697 i didnt come for bronze but im really happy physically i was more ready than i have ever been but mentally i was tired it has been good and the ups and downs are something to remember
7458698 it was not by luck that we survived we never used witchcraft we were vigilant and co ordinated in our security services and we also used to share intelligence
7458699 unbeknown to many a terror attack had been planned targeting the u s embassy in uganda in july of 2001 just two months before the september 11 attacks in america
7458700 four trucks filled with c 4 explosives had been brought to kampala in uganda and operatives there had begun casing the american embassy
7458701 we did serious analysis we had experienced personnel not like our colleagues kenya and tanzania who suffered the attacks uganda had had a long time with dealing with terrorism here for example the adf allied democratic forces the khartoum sponsored terrorists
7458702 the culprits were tried in military courts and some were imprisoned
7458703 had contacts with al qaeda and the allied democratic forces
7458704 uganda has effectively responded and has neutralised their plans and stopped them uganda remains prepared and vigilant to avert terrorism plans that may be hatched as to the target and details i am not in position at the moment to comment on that
7458705 jika kami keluar bn nanti kami tidak akan memperjuangkan satu kaum sahaja bahkan menjadi parti pelbagai kaum
7458706 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7458707 people want to catch up on events that they miss
7458708 is that they want to resee and revisit the major events they had seen on tv earlier
7458709 parece que va a durar a n por un tiempo considerable
7458710 tenemos los dedos cruzados de que las cosas mejorar n pero hay un reconocimiento de que todav a queda camino por recorrer
7458711 one must always take threats seriously both those made by israel and by mr nasrallah because this is a very inflammatory region
7458712 but honestly this time i dont take either side very seriously and i hope i am not mistaken
7458713 israel est dispuesto a hacer concesiones dolorosas para avanzar en las negociaciones de paz
7458714 es un d a de alegr a para todos los luchadores por la libertad y la independencia
7458715 es como un d a de boda para el pueblo palestino aunque nuestra alegr a no ser completa hasta la liberaci n de todos los presos palestinos
7458716 no es f cil liberar prisioneros especialmente aquellos que est n implicados directamente en actos terroristas contra civiles inocentes
7458717 helping people come to their own most logical conclusion which also happens to be one you share
7458718 we knew it was only a matter of time when there was going to be some drastic changes or cancellation
7458719 we all knew we benefited greatly from that charter and had to prepare ourselves for the time when things were to change
7458720 it humber direct air started off with just four or five of us but it grew from there because we wanted to get more people involved who represented different facets of the businesses that are around here
7458721 how we go about it well have to see we are still exploring different avenues with partnerships amongst ourselves and along with humber valley resort we thought its better to do it together than for one particular business to try and continue it themselves
7458722 that could be replicated many times if the tourists trip out to the rock can be maintained
7458723 as a couple we dont need convincing that newfoundland is a gem but easy access to it will bring benefits that will be felt locally by local people
7458724 as a group of business we may have some influence with the powers that be and we hope ultimately there will be some government participation for a short period of time
7458725 we feel that flight will be self sufficient eventually but it certainly needs help to get the product up and running
7458726 is that it was strange so out of character for pow wow and believe me we get a lot here
7458727 he wanted pictures from all the way around and always two pictures it was weird
7458728 are we talking a 300 million pullout to bring in 300 million
7458729 youre not going to hold a gun to our heads youre forgetting this is a minority parliament the people didnt give you a free pass
7458730 seg n la comisi n del mercado de las telecomunicaciones nuestro precio medio por minuto es un 11 m s bajo que el de la competencia
7458731 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
7458732 in the prince harry coverage for example there were all these people out there you never really saw them
7458733 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7458734 it probably did bring a lot of people to think about afghanistan who normally wouldnt ordinarily think about afghanistan if the prince harry story can bring more people to think about afghanistan then thats a good thing

7458877 kami tidak akan memberikan jawatan pemerintahan ini kepada orang yang memintanya dan berusaha untuk mendapatkannya
7458878 dan hendaklah kamu memutuskan perkara di antara mereka menurut apa yang diturunkan allah
7458879 maka demi tuhanmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim terhadap perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa dalam hati mereka sesuatu keberatan terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
7458880 allah subhanahu wa taala bersumpah dengan diri nya yang maha mulia bahawa seseorang tidak beriman sehingga dia berhukum kepada rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wa sallam dalam setiap urusan dan perkara

7458882 dan menyuruh kamu agar sentiasa apabila menetapkan hukum di antara manusia supaya kamu menetapkan dengan adil
7458883 sesungguhnya orang orang yang berlaku adil pada hari kiamat kelak ia berada di atas mimbar dari cahaya di sebelah kanan allah yang maha pengasih kedua tangan allah sebelah kanan mimbar tersebut diberikan untuk orang yang berlaku adil dalam hukum mereka keluarga mereka dan yang mereka kuasai
7458884 tidaklah seseorang lelaki memimpin sepuluh orang kecuali ia akan didatangkan dalam keadaan tangan yang terbelenggu pada hari kiamat keadilan yang ia lakukan akan melepaskannya dari ikatan atau kezalimannya akan menjadikannya celaka

7458893 ya allah bagi siapa yang menjadi penguasa umatku lalu dia menyulitkan mereka maka timpakanlah kesulitan kepadanya dan barang siapa yang menjadi penguasa umatku lalu ia menyayangi mereka maka sayangilah dia
7458894 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu dan mengerjakan amal amal yang soleh bahawa dia sungguh sungguh akan menjadikan mereka berkuasa di muka bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang sebelum mereka berkuasa dan sungguh dia akan meneguhkan bagi mereka agama yang telah diredhai nya untuk mereka dan dia benar benar akan menukar keadaan mereka sesudah mereka dalam ketakutan menjadi aman sentosa mereka tetap menyembah ku dengan tiada mempersekutukan sesuatu apa pun dengan aku dan barangsiapa yang tetap kafir sesudah janji itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang fasiq

7458903 dan jika kami hendak membinasakan suatu negeri maka kami perintahkan orang orang yang hidup mewah di negeri itu supaya mentaati allah tetapi mereka melakukan kefasikan kederhakaan dalam negeri itu maka sudah sewajarnya berlaku terhadap mereka perkataan ketentuan kami kemudian kami hancurkan negeri itu sehancur hancurnya
7458904 dan penduduk negeri itu telah kami binasakan ketika mereka berbuat kezaliman
7458905 dan demikian kami jadikan sebahagian orang orang yang zalim itu menguasai sebahagian yang lain disebabkan apa apa yang mereka masyarakat usahakan
7458906 wahai rakyatku bersikap adillah kepada kami bagaimana mungkin kalian mahukan dari diri kami sebagaimana yang dilaksanakan oleh abu bakar dan umar sedangkan kalian tidak pun mengerjakan sebagaimana apa yang mereka amalkan

7459182 what were finding is that there are quite a lot of countries which share very much the same kind of concerns new zealand has raised
7459183 were continuing to work those issues through with the others
7459184 we acknowledge that india does have a good track record of non proliferation but nevertheless it remains outside of the npt it has developed tested and possesses nuclear weapons
7459185 what we would like to see ideally are a range of conditions which would apply to india if the exemption is given
7459186 we dont think that anything we are asking for is unreasonable
7459187 were not trying to obstruct indias ability to receive supplies of material and technology for a civilian nuclear capacity and therefore should not be objectionable to either india or the us

7459208 definitively deprived the georgian leadership of the right to push for the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples dependence on their adventurist polices which have led to a humanitarian catastrophe
7459209 in view of the repeated requests from south ossetia and abkhazia to recognize their independence including those made on august 22 and 24 the federation council proposes that russia support their independence
7459210 i am asking russia to recognize south ossetia as an independent and sovereign state
7459211 what the georgian leadership has done in south ossetia can only be described as a caucasus stalingrad
7459212 it is hard to say what decision russias political leaders will make on our republics but i can say for certain that abkhazia and south ossetia will never be part of georgia
7459213 we are requesting that you overcome this barrier which has for a long time been a difficult thing to do and recognize our republics as independent states

7459228 nigeria have got very good players and they are a very disciplined team
7459229 we had seen the players on video a lot of times and we knew about their attacking strength
7459230 we studied them very carefully because we saw they had very dangerous players the number nine obinna nsofor and the number 14 osaze odemwingie were very fast and very skillful so we needed to play intelligently and move the ball around
7459231 i just loved it i enjoyed it 100 per cent lots of duels lots of energy
7459232 i signed two days ago trained once and today i played and didnt know their names during the game i learned their names learned how everyone plays
7459233 it was a lot of fun i wanted to play an intelligent game and try to do my best for the team i loved it in midfield but a job had to be done in defence
7459234 thats why the trainer hughes took me because he can count on me in different positions
7459235 everyone is delighted with the way that we have won this trophy and it is what makes this club great and it will long be remembered
7459236 scoring three goals with nine players will not happen very often we have shown determination and spirit and that has made me very proud of everything we are doing here
7459237 the players are natural born winners and they do not know how to lose it is not in their make up it is what makes madrid so great and we are so happy and proud
7459238 everyone has been great and showed great mentality as well as being physically strong now we have to take advantage of this and go for the other three trophies available this season
7459239 there is a feeling that this team cannot be stopped
7459240 i knew how good aiden was when i left but he has improved a hell of a lot
7459241 he has pretty much everything now the final delivery the shot or pass he has that end product to his game now
7459242 he scares the life out of defenders when he starts running at them if players make runs ahead of him then he will find them

7459367 dan janganlah salah seorang diantara kalian beristinja dengan mempergunakan kurang dari tiga batu
7459368 hindarilah tiga tempat yang terlaknan buang hajat ditempat aliran air dipinggir jalan dan ditempat berteduh
7459369 yaitu yang buang hajat dijalanan yang sering dilewatri kaum manusia dan ditempat mereka bernaung
7459370 yang dimaksud dengan dua sifat orang yang dilanat yaitu dua perkata yang sangat jelas menjadi sebab timbulnya laknat yang menjadikan dan mendorong kaum manusia untuk melaknat pelakunya
7459371 dan bisa jadi pula yang melaknat bermakna yang memperoleh laknat sedangkan tempat yang dilaknat adalah tempat tempat yang menjadi alasan adanya laknat
7459372 dan mereka yang menyakiti kaum mukminin laki laki dan perempuan bukan karena perbuatan yang telah mereka lakukan maka sesungguhnya mereka telah melakukan kedustaan dan perbuatan dosa yang jelas
7459373 dan yang buang hajat ditempat berlalu lalangnya kaum manusia dan ditempat bernaung mereka
7459374 dan tidaklahshahih penafsiran an nawawi hanya dengan buang hajat besar
7459375 dan anda telah mengatehui bahwa makan at takhalli adalah bersendiri untuk buang haja baik itu hajat besar ataupun hajat kecil dan anda telah mengetahui bahwa
7459376 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian buang hajat besar maka janganlah dia menghadap kekiblat dan janganlah dia mengarahkan punggungnya kekiblat akan tetapi menghadaplah kearah timur atau barat
7459377 janganlah kalian menghadap kearah kiblat dan janganlah kalian membelakanginya dengan kencing atau buang hajat besar akan tetapi menghadaplah kearah timur atau barat
7459378 sesungguhnya orang orang mengatakan apabila anda duduk menunaikan hajat anda maka janganlah anda menghadap kearah kiblat dan jangan pulakearah bait al maqdis
7459379 sungguh saya telah memanjat rumah kami dan saya melihat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berada pada dua batu sedang mengahdap kearah baitu al maqdis sedang menunaikan hajatnya al hadits
7459380 saya telah melihat ibnu umar radhiallahu anhuma menambatkan tungangannyamnghadap kearah kiblat lalu beliau duduk dankencing kearah tunggannya
7459381 dan tidak ada perbedaan dikalangan ulama bahwa apabila memungkinkan untuk menyelaraskan hadits hadits tersebut maka meninggalkan sebagian hadits hadits tersebut tidak dilakukan melainkan wajib untuk menyelaraskannya dan mengamalkan kesemua hadits hdist tersebut
7459382 sesungguhnya pohon pohon kurma yang menyemak ini adalah tempat hadirnya syaithan al hadits
7459383 qawaid syariyah telah menetapkan bahwa segala perbuatan yang mana anggota tubuh bagian kanan dan kiri bersamaan pengerjaannya maka bagian kanan didahulukan apabila perbuatan tersebut suatu yang mulia seperti wudhu mandi mendahulukan bagian kanan disaat bersiwak mencabut bulu ketiak memakai pakaian memakai sandal menyisir rambut masuk kedalam masjid dan rumah dan keluar dari tempat buang hajat dan lain sebagainya
7459384 apabila nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam keluar dari buang hajat mengucapkan
7459385 aku pernah bersafar bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan beliau berkata
7459386 fiqh hadits ini diantaranya sunnahnya menutupi diri sewaktu menunaikan hajat baik dengan dinding pohon kurma rimbunan pohon
7459387 barang siapa yang menceritakan kepada kalian bahwa rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah kencing berdiri maka janganlah kalian membenarkanyya tidaklah beliau kencing kecuali smabil duduk
7459388 dan saya telah melahat diriku dan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7459389 larangan menyentuh kemaluan dan ber istinja dengan tangan kanan karena dua makna
7459390 apabila salah seorang diantara kalian kencing maka janganlah dia memegang kemaluannya dengan tangan kanannya dan janganlah dia ber istinja dengan tangan kanannya dan janganlah dia menghembuskan nafas didalam bejana air
7459391 janganlah salah seorang diantara kalian memegang kemaluannya dengan tangan kanannya sewaktu kencing dan janganlah dia membasuh setelah buang hajat dengan tangan kanannya
7459392 adalah hadits yang dhaif tidak akan kuat untuk dipertenangkan dengan hadits hadits yang shahih yang menunjukkan bahwa barang siapa yang memegang kemaluannya maka wajib baginya untuk berwudhu
7459393 allah menghendaki bagi kalian kemudahan dan tidak menghendaki bagi kalian kesulitan
7459394 carikanlah aku beberapa batu untuk saya gunakan ber istinja 46 atau yang semisal kalimat tersebut dan janganlah engkau mendatangkan tulang atau kotoran hewan yang telah kering
7459395 al istinja dapat dengan mempergunakan air dan dapat pula dengan mempergunakan batu dan dapat pula dengan mempergunakan kedua duanya adapun yang pertama dan yang kedua telah ada beberapa atsar yang shahih menerangkannya sedangkan yang ketiga
7459396 carikanlah aku beberapa batu untuk membersihkan diri dengannya dan janganlah engkau datangkan tulang atau kotoran hewan yang telah kering
7459397 maka saya berkata ada apakah dengan tulang dan kotoran hewan beliau bersabda keduanya adalahmakanan jin dan sesungguhnya dia telah mendatangiku kelompok jin dalam dua kelompok dan sebaik baik jin mereka lalu mereka bertanya kepadaku tentang bekal makanan mereka maka saya berdoa kepada allah bagi mereka agar tidaklah mereka melintassebuah tulang atau kotoran hewan yang telah kering kecuali mereka mendapatkan makanan padanya
7459398 janganlah salah seorang diantara kalian ber istinja kurang dari tiga batu
7459399 sebagian kaum msuyrikin dan mereka mengejek dengan perkataan mereka sesungguhnya saya telah melihat bahwa kawan kalian telah mengajarkan kepada kalian hingga persoalan buang hajat salman berkata al hadits

7459414 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7459415 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7459416 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7459417 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7459418 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7459419 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news

7459430 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7459431 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7459432 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7459433 i was annoyed that is not sportsmanship when you pull on someones feet
7459434 the first few times when people hit your feet you feel like shouting at them but you have to look ahead keep swimming and try to ignore it
7459435 if you start reacting then you are taking the focus off the race i know exactly who it was i think the tv camera picked it up that i had words with her at the end
7459436 i was so annoyed because i would never do that to anyone i didnt get to savour that moment of looking up and seeing my name in the medals because i was so angry however ive got a medal and she hasnt she claimed she didnt see me i wont say anymore because i dont want to start a war
7459437 i just keeping looking at the medal around my neck and thinking is it mine ive dreamt about this moment for 16 years and i cant describe how it feels

7459458 well folks the opinion polls are still showing a commanding lead for the tories despite all our efforts so far
7459459 we are just going to have to do better much better
7459460 but we have tried everything we can sir short of breaking the law to an extent that could be proven in court
7459461 and weve stretched our degree of slant and partiality beyond even that and are barely getting away with it
7459462 well it hasnt worked what about the blogs and other opinion columns cant you people do more to help
7459463 weve passed the point where the law of diminishing returns cuts in boss no one takes any notice of us any more apart from a few die hard lefties they are overwhelmed by vast numbers of ordinary brits and ex pats in the comments sections
7459464 it cant be that bad surely what do i pay you for if you cant write stuff thatll shift public opinion our way
7459465 have you seen what has been happening to that pally with toyboy her recent columns have been slated by hundreds of negative comments many attacking her stance directly rosy princess is suffering from the same thing i know ive checked we can no longer win this battle whatever we do
7459466 that is just ridiculous we are the ones who write what millions of people read every day most of our competitors are essentially writing the same to a greater or lesser degree only the london evening standard has a significantly more balanced output than all of ours after all these years youd think we could handle just about any situation and between all of us here and in the other papers successfully push our agenda has none of you seen the james bond film tomorrow never dies
7459467 its the bloggers sir they have uncovered some rather unfortunate facts about certain mps and ministers
7459468 they can also compare news coverage from all over in a way that we cannot sensibly do and nor would we want to we can no longer easily hide or gloss over bad news on the government side and it is also becoming very difficult to have a go at the tories in particular we are still ignoring the libdems as much as we can
7459469 and when we do find something perhaps in last years archives that we can try to tarnish cameron or his buddies with by association or selective and out of context quoting the bloggers take it apart find out the truth and put it about
7459470 but their readership is but a fraction of ours how can they possibly have any real effect on public opinion
7459471 unlike our readership most of those who read such blogsites are keenly interested and prepared to be swayed worse they spread the facts at work in the pub or even over the breakfast table very few of our readers do that to anything like the same extent if at all
7459472 well even so we cant give up we have our own blogs after all
7459473 yes but were back to the adverse comments again we can delete those we dont like but that gets spotted as commenters keep records of their comments and report on the other blogs that we and our counterparts dont control ive seen it myself on several of those blogs most notably guido s i like to keep an eye on what the enemy is up to
7459474 i didnt do what i wanted but i think i did pretty good i came around better than when i started
7459475 hell tell you that as well he said that hes probably learned more in the time that hes been here than hes ever learned in his baseball career
7459476 hitting base running fielding throwing knowledge of the game all areas
7459477 i learned a lot of stuff hitting as well as fielding wise
7459478 it was actually harder than i thought it was going to be
7459479 i get the same ground balls as i was before
7459480 but i know more stuff now so i added the stuff i got taught this year with the stuff i already knew and im an all around better player
7459481 they show me a lot of support its like a high school stadium it just got you going it got your intensity up
7459482 i think thats what scares me the randomness of everything that the people who could be important to you might just pass you by or you pass them by how did you know should i turn around and talk to the mexican boy maybe he was lonely like me maybe he read denton welch
7459483 its great virginia tech is sort of like richlands theyre winning every season and were going to a bowl game for 15 straight years
7459484 its like richlands going to the playoffs however many straight years and going to the state championship game the last three years so it kind of the same
7459485 its great just coming out here being with these guys you see on tv and being a hokie fan growing up
7459486 its always been my dream i wasnt sure if it would really come true or not until i we finally started coming on and now im here so it is great
7459487 i would imagine they are going to redshirt me this year there are some good players in front of me
7459488 i dont mind its just an extra year of free education and just to get to be out here with all these guys its great just being out here
7459489 austin fuller wanted to play on defense and i really like this kid
7459490 i think he is going to be a good football player with the more experience that he gets hell be a really good player
7459491 even though i may have seemed smart in high school this is new
7459492 weve got about 10 different coverages and maybe more and we probably played about three in high school
7459493 its difficult its just getting used to the speed of the game everybody is flying around running 4 4s and 4 3s 4 6s its a lot different
7459494 its pretty much speed those guys can fly at receiver i figure i have a better chance of playing over on defense as long as i dont let them get behind me
7459495 i came in and i was still out of shape we were running suicides and 110s and i missed a couple of my times
7459496 it is hard but he got me in shape and now im finishing up in the top groups with everybody hes helped me a lot
7459497 now that ive figured out the coverages are kind of the same for the whip but it took me a while to figure that out
7459498 dylan mcgreevy has sort of taken me under his wing and helped me out a lot
7459499 cam cody they have helped me out a lot and coach cavanaugh just watching film every day and showing me what im doing wrong and ill tell you if youre doing something wrong hell tell you
7459500 coach mance was always yelling at me every second i would do anything wrong and coach cav is a little bit like that but not quite
7459501 i dont get to go home with him every night and get it when i get home
7459502 we watched film one or two days in a week at richlands
7459503 we watch film probably twice a day out here just watching the practice film we never filmed practice in high school we were just watching other teams so its a lot different
7459504 they got that field turf a little bit late the year after i leave they get the field turf and field house everything but thats all right
7459505 our class helped get it so that was a good deal
7459506 hopefully the classes coming up can continue that winning tradition im hoping to get down there for a couple of games and root for them on hopefully theyll do good
7459507 it is different here there are few more people here but richlands football there is nothing like it
7459508 i started in second grade and ive played every year since
7459509 its been a fun ride its been a lot of trying times in it but its been great and ive had a blast
7459510 right now is one of the years ive been waiting for my whole life and im really looking forward to this season a lot
7459511 it feels a little weird but right now im just focused on the season and not really worried about what is going to happen afterwards
7459512 im just focused on getting ready for villanova and helping the team out as much as possible and doing my job to the best of my ability
7459513 it feels good to have that year of experience under your belt it makes you a lot more confident but ive always got to work hard
7459514 youve got to keep pushing and keep working on everything every day and not getting relaxed and saying ive got the starting job handled or anything
7459515 i cant get like that ive got to be focused and work my butt off every day like i have for the last four years
7459516 i feel like i have gotten a lot better in a few areas
7459517 the speed of my snaps just continues to get better my accuracy is so much more consistent than its ever been everything just keeps improving every day
7459518 its definitely an attainable season of snapping every ball exactly where it needs to be and thats always a goal thats what i strive for
7459519 this season my personal goals are just to continue to get better and continue to do my job on this team and to continue to help this team as much as possible by doing my job right and not messing up any
7459520 when we come into the season we are expecting a big east championship and a national championship every year but for right now were focused on villanova
7459521 were just going to take it one game at a time and not look ahead to anybody because every team can jump up and bite you and knock you off so were focused on villanova right now
7459522 people see that all you do is practice against your teammates for the camp part but they forget about spring ball
7459523 youre playing against each other for a month so its really like seven straight weeks of just practicing against each other and you get tired of that real quick
7459524 i cant wait after last season im itching to get back out on the field im just itching to get out in front of all the fans and start playing against somebody else instead of playing against your own teammates
7459525 im really looking forward to villanova were expecting them to come in here and were expecting to take their best shot but were going to give them our best shot too
7459526 we do have a tough schedule this year but were not focused on anybody else but villanova right now
7459527 thats our main focus and after that we will focus on the next game
7459528 were really excited theres a lot of good things going on this year
7459529 weve got a good team senior leadership is just phenonomal this year i cant wait to get out there and play bluefield
7459530 we would like to have a first game but it just gets us more prepared
7459531 it will be our last chance to beat bluefield these seniors were really looking forward to that game
7459532 we won one game but were going to make that change this year
7459533 i think were going to be a better team than what we were last year
7459534 the enthuasium is there and the intensity is there so i think well have a good team
7459535 it is hard but it also gives us an extra week to get ready for bluefield and watch film against graham and just break down the plays and get ready
7459536 its really hard not having that first week but well make our changes
7459537 were putting in more of a wing this year instead of that spread so well see how it goes
7459538 this year is looking much better weve got a lot more experience this year
7459539 last year we were all young but this year everybody has pretty much had some varsity time
7459540 most of our linemen are coming back weve got a lot of guys coming back actually
7459541 we were all pretty much juniors last year but well be good because were switching some things up and making some changes that should help us win
7459542 its going to be great this is our senior year
7459543 weve come out and changed some things from last year all the seniors have stepped up and showed their leadership this year so it should be a good season
7459544 it was a rough season working and trying to get better every week and still just taking that beating
7459545 its a real tough conference but youve got to work hard and take it to them every week theyre really tough you have to come and play four quarters every friday night
7459546 ive been waiting a long time for this year im just real happy that i am a senior now
7459547 it goes by too quick i cant believe im already a senior its my last year
7459548 we do stuff together all the year we hang out and try to bond together and just show our leadership
7459549 we want to show that we can come together as a team and just lead this team hopefully to the playoffs and hopefully to the state
7459550 its been great i love it i love the coaches the facilities are awesome
7459551 weve all been together since middle school were real close were like brothers out here
7459552 ive been playing with most of them since my seventh grade year
7459553 its going to be tough leaving them after this year
7459554 weve just got to stay together as a team and play hard every friday night
7459555 i love it here i wouldnt do this with anyone else in the state
7459556 i just had to ask myself would he busch do that to me and i thought back to the nationwide race at bristol when he was going for the lead and pile drove me there were points there for us to take and we couldnt afford to let them get away
7459557 of course he edwards is going to say hes sorry he bumped me going into turn one and got by me if thats the way he wants to race then thats the way well race him from now on

7459570 un cambio de conducta entre los malague os y los visitantes
7459571 when you look at the figures on paper with two seniors and three juniors were a young team
7459572 but the caliber of players that we recruit at concord and have recruited for a few years time really allows us to step in and contend i believe that were able to contend every year i dont believe concord should ever be marked out of that
7459573 sometimes its really obvious who the starting 11 is going to be now its really not obvious its wide open its pushing us to work harder in practice because weve got to fight for our spots
7459574 its good that we have a lot of new faces in its fresh and its exciting
7459575 were just trying to figure out whos going to be the best group to go on the field and even if they dont make a starting spot were going to have a great group of girls ready to come in at any moment
7459576 overall the girls are as prepared as they can be for the start of the season
7459577 i think our level has definitely stepped up a lot were more competitive we push each other to work harder
7459578 a lot of peoples attitudes have changed and were working hard as a team
7459579 it gives you more options when were attacking but it also helps the defenders there are a lot of people on this team who can finish goal attempts and a lot of people who like getting forward
7459580 we changed our system to offer more offensive plays but by changing that we dont sacrifice our defense with a variety of midfield and attacking players it really gives us more of an opportunity to be an offensive threat this year
7459581 due to the strengths of the team that we have
7459582 it seems to be going well we have a lot of options with it so were hoping it can help us to score some goals
7459583 it left a sour taste in our mouth the way we finished it wasnt the prettiest of games we know we could all play better and work harder so that doesnt happen again
7459584 for all the returning players that game is going to make us all more hungry this season we cant take that game back so were just going to start fresh this year but in the back of our minds its kind of like pushing us
7459585 weve got two hard games at the beginning of the season as always it gives us the opportunity to put our focus and our goals high
7459586 i think itll be very interesting to see how everybody fares at the end of the season
7459587 the happiest soldiers i met were the ones who spend months at a time in bleak perilous conditions and who scorn the doughnuts and menus of their less exposed countrymen
7459588 our market segment is still intact as a matter of fact weve witnessed rapid growth over the past one year at the moment we are experiencing a double digit growth and this does not necessarily mean 10 per cent

7459592 you know somewhere up the food chain youre bound to run into a jew or two from new york the problem is they usually dont end up in a place like this answering a question like that
7459593 no no thats ok well have a little meeting tomorrow in sterling just me and you and anyone you want to bring to the meeting and well clear this up
7459594 lets go back gentlemen many many millions of years when the earth was forming into the place we know today the historical period im talking about which of course was very prehistoric had a name
7459595 its the act of absorbing sunlight to bring about an organic reaction thats what these trillions and trillions and trillions of amebae did there are still large bodies of similar amebae today photos taken from spacecraft and satellites show islands of amebae in todays oceans but in the jurassic period as today the amebae had a lifespan and when they died they sank to the oceans floor or often times it was the floor of a sea these amebae were joined by the carcases the remains of other sea creatures including dinosaurs and as all this decayed it became a black oily substance which smelled like
7459596 yes it smelled just like oil derrick how did you know that
7459597 because one year when my brother was playing up in new england on cape cod i went up to see him and i noticed that lots of the bogs had the same smell that you have around a drilling rig
7459598 thats the smell of advanced decay to make a long story short some of these bottom deposits and by the way the ocean at that depth has no oxygen some of these bottom deposits over millions of years were covered up with sediment of various kinds and in time the black ooze solidified and turned into a kind of slate now to understand what happens next you have to know what the core of the earth is like who can tell me whats under the outer crust of the earth
7459599 and the heat from this core changes the oil bearing slate you know if you see an outcropping of this kind of slate and there are outcroppings there are huge outcroppings along the southern coast of england you can take a piece of this slate and hold a butane lighter to it and it will start burning yes this rock will burn but im getting ahead of myself the heat of the earths core affects the buried slate if there is too much heat it vaporizes and turns into gas if theres too little heat it becomes gooey like tar but if the heat level is just right it turns into liquid and under the best of circumstances it turns into fine sweet crude i guess you can see where im heading but we wouldnt even be talking about this if it werent for the sperm whale now derrick youve been to cape cod tell me what the sperm whale has to do with this
7459600 you know until 1859 august of 1859 to be exact the basic source of mechanical lubricants and lantern lights was the rendered blubber of sperm whales if youre on cape cod and you go to woods hole youll see one of these rendering plants its a laboratory now whale oil is a very fine oil that is still in limited use you see we lived in a non lubricated world before 1859 but big changes were at hand factories and locomotives came into common use they required lubrication ill tell you a little statistic which i hope you dont find offensive but the greatest source of lubrication prior to this period of time was vaginal lubrication
7459601 but the problem in 1859 was the juxtaposition of a diminishing supply of whale oil and a bludgeoning need for something to lubricate all the new machines coming out of the industrial age
7459602 not a bunch of derricks like you but the other kind but what precipitated me looking up glenn was another juxtaposition of time and place as a broker i was constantly looking for a way to invest mutual fund money especially european mutual fund money a lot of it out of germany in other words ive got money to spend and im here glenn to spend it with you so make up your mind about all this i want to settle it today im going down town to the piggly wiggly and im going to have a cup of coffee and if you want to come and join me for lunch with your decision thats up to you
7459603 i thought lewis was a very wealthy man and that he wanted everything just so so
7459604 well he didnt care didnt make any difference to him hed tell you it didnt and so when he got through eating we moved in the living room and was talking i waited a while and then i got up and fixed something it was cake and ice cream and as i handed his to him i went around the back of him to go to glenn and it was his shirt collar turned down with holes all the way through the back and then i felt like i knew who he was

7459615 tackling malnutrition should be a top priority for all nhs trusts
7459616 its shocking that many older people still find themselves trapped within a postcode lottery of commitment to improve nutritional standards on hospital wards
7459617 we know that good nutrition is central to peoples good health and ability to recover from illness which is why in october 2007 we launched the nutrition action plan in conjunction with over 25 leading stakeholders
7459618 this aims to outline how nutritional care and hydration can be improved amongst vulnerable adults in all health and social care settings
7459619 the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future
7459620 after the military conflict with russia georgia cannot be marked on oil and gas maps as a safe transit route and no amount of support from nato can change this alteration
7459621 has always looked more like a diplomats pipe dream than a viable economic project
7459622 its promoters had not only failed to secure supply and transit agreements but also had yet to identify an oil company eager to champion the project and finance the pipeline
7459623 a mere demonstration of force apparently was enough to put tremendous psychological pressure on both suppliers and consumers
7459624 during the conflict russias black sea fleet patrolled georgias coast apparently indicating that the task to transport crude oil from ports to international markets could become a challenging objective
7459625 not a doable project because there is not enough gas to justify the investment
7459626 the only thing that can make it viable is by using iranian gas
7459627 want to have their cake and eat it too they want to keep europe from using russian gas and they want to keep iran in a corner too
7459628 we can forget about that project now russia has made that very clear russia did not invade kazakhstan but rather a small country that is a bottleneck between central asia and the west no one will want to take the risk of angering the russians again
7459629 accelerating the integration of countries between the eu and russia
7459630 a weakened georgia means that the eu will have a less effective partner in the south caucasus
7459631 wants to be an accepted member of the international community and worries what the world thinks of it
7459632 to play on russian sensitivities about its role and status in the world
7459633 the most the eu can do is make russia feel excluded
7459634 move beyond mediating duties because it has an interest in preventing war in countries on its eastern borders
7459635 europes best response lies in increasing its assistance to countries of eastern europe and in directing eu aid at projects that reduce the regions vulnerability to russian pressure
7459636 will neither end the hostilities in georgia nor help avoid another war in eastern europe
7459637 should the eu start making threats to russia moscow would match them and even up the ante
7459638 the eu should be willing to run the risk of annoying moscow when its own vital interests are at stake
7459639 complacency is enemy number one when it comes to preparing for another influenza pandemic
7459640 these stories told so eloquently by survivors family members and friends from past pandemics serve as a sobering reminder of the devastating impact that influenza can have and reading them is a must for anyone involved in public health preparedness
7459641 obtaining fast track designation for custirsen sodium while developing our phase 3 program for hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc and in advance of initiating our phase 3 study is very important and should help us move forward expeditiously on our pathway toward commercialization

7459657 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7459658 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7459659 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7459660 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity

7459725 the epa new england region is completely indifferent to state and local concerns as a passionate environmentalist with a 100 percent rating from the league of conservation voters i want high environmental standards at every level

7459766 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great middle east e gaming development business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
7459767 starting up any middle east e gaming development business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
7459768 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the middle east e gaming development product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
7459769 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
7459770 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your middle east e gaming development firm that you may not have thought of before
7459771 in the case of our middle east e gaming development marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
7459772 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts

7459774 the proceeds will be used to fund aluminas share of the additional investment in awacs projects in brazil and to strengthen the balance sheet so that we are capitalised for the needs of the business including for increased working capital
7459775 we are investing in additional capacity at a time of unprecedented global demand for alumina and aluminium investing in high quality long life assets is increasingly important to meet the continued growth in demand from our customers and enhance our competitive position the awac joint venture controls some of the worlds finest bauxite and alumina assets and has a proven history of strong cash flow distribution
7459776 the proceeds will be used to fund aluminas share of the additional investment in awacs projects in brazil as announced on 21 july 2008 and to strengthen the balance sheet so that we are capitalised for the needs of the business including for increased working capital
7459777 this will take place at the constituency locational sub locational and polling centre levels
7459778 first and foremost there is no mp who is a pnu member per se except for the president they are all sponsored by other political parties
7459779 it is shocking and surprising that there are still some individuals who continue to confuse the head of state that pnu will survive
7459780 if the registrar of societies does not take quick action to bar this then well consider further action including going to court
7459781 politics cannot be the order of the day from one general election to the other while kenyans have pressing needs that need to be fulfilled
7459782 we got the license but we have had to change our direction while other plans were shelved
7459783 as of now we will run cdma network which is different from our network in sudan so this cannot allow gemtel subscribers to be interconnected with i tel in terms of cross border network as the networks are not compatible
7459784 the object of this bill is to anchor the existence and functioning of the parliamentary opposition in a statute law
7459785 while it is universally acknowledged that the opposition is a central cog in the wheel of democracy whether established or emergent there has never been any attempt in kenya to clothe parliamentary opposition in fine linen
7459786 the result is that the opposition in kenya has since independence gone about in a state of virtual legal nudity precariously hinging on practice usages customs and momentary political benevolence
7459787 we are not attempting to re invent the wheel in the first earlier parts of the bill we are only seeking to clothe the official opposition which over the years has been left legally naked
7459788 we have a grand coalition of two main parties where part of the mps are in government and others on the back bench even under the political parties act mps of the same party cannot be in government and the opposition at the same time
7459789 how does the national assembly function in a scenario where all major political parties are joined in government answering this question through legislation is critical because the constitution the standing orders and established customs of the national assembly do not envisage a situation where parliament functions without a formally recognised opposition
7459790 however the focus on changing behavior as the main issue in controlling the epidemic has been ignored and is focusing on building more latrines than teaching people on how to use them the biggest issue is the need to build more latrines getting people to change behavior by using latrines requires a long term educational effort not short term crisis management
7459791 if nothing else weve got to match uniteds work rate thats what weve done every time weve got a good result against them and thats what we have to do again or we will be punished by their quality
7459792 t estimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding if the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct cross or redirect examination
7459793 is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarants attendance by process or other reasonable means
7459794 the central constitutional inquiry is whether or not the governments actions were reasonable given all the circumstances of a particular case
7459795 e ven where the absent witness is beyond the courts jurisdiction the government must show diligent effort on its part to secure the witness voluntary return to testify
7459796 supreme court has never extended the concept of unavailability to the point where the government seeks to extend it here that is to find a witness unavailable when the government itself shares some of the responsibility for its inability to produce the witness at trial
7459797 plain in matter of juridical reason that this right to introduce the deposition grows out of the great doctrine of necessity
7459798 the declarants inability to give live testimony is in no way the fault of the state
7459799 carols statements that she was feeling stressed and was afraid of appellant were relevant to prove her intent to end the marriage these statements were properly admitted as evidence under evid r 803 3 which permits hearsay evidence of a declarants then existing state of mind emotion sensation such as intent plan motive design mental feeling or pain to be sure testimony of state of mind witnesses that the victim was fearful and apprehensive is not inadmissible hearsay and is properly admitted in addition statements about carols plans to separate and end the marriage were also admissible under evid r 803 3
7459800 a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy
7459801 out of court statements by the party offering the statements and out of court statements by co conspirators of the party offering the statements when offered for their truth remain hearsay and are not admissible unless they fit within an exception to the hearsay rule
7459802 t he wealth of a defendant is directly relevant to the size of a punitive damages award which is meant to deter the defendant from repeating his misconduct as well as punish him for his past behavior
7459803 the amount of punitive damages which will have a deterrent effect on the defendant in light of the defendants financial condition
7459804 a punitive damages award is supposed to sting so as to deter a defendants reprehensible conduct and juries have traditionally been permitted to consider a defendants assets in determining an award that will carry the right degree of sting
7459805 an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis commonly though not necessarily an emotional one
7459806 u nfair prejudice means that the evidence not only has a significant impact on the defendants case
7459807 while the admissibility of evidence is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion
7459808 under the plain error standard an appellant must demonstrate that 1 there was an error 2 the error was plain and 3 the error affected substantial rights

7459810 we just hope that the surgery goes well on tuesday and that it is a full recovery and that he is even better than ever here shortly down the road
7459811 as for the rest of us we received this information this morning
7459812 i tried to talk to the coaches about it and i assured the coaches that we will have to be at our best because our team will know before they come in here tomorrow because of the media and we have to do a great job of getting our players refocused and our thoughts on going forward
7459813 you know what someone has already raised that today and i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything to be honest with you
7459814 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7459815 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners

7459819 you can define a net in one of two ways depending on your point of view normally you would say that it is a meshed instrument designed to catch fish but you could with no great injury to logic reverse the image and define the net as a jocular lexicographer once did he called it a collection of holes tied together with string
7459820 you can define a net in one of two ways depending on your point of view
7459821 the price of the crude in the world market has been reduced greatly but oil firms have responded with small rollbacks the arroyo government has also been playing deaf to reasonable call by workers and the country for a p125 legislated wage increase and the removal of vat on oil products and power
7459822 we were inconsistent its different when we dont have rj in the squad good thing gutilban stepped up for him
7459823 i have to check the mindset of our team its not a good character for a team that is aspiring something big
7459824 but i like our chances now still our target is the final four were not yet thinking about the twice to beat bonus
7459825 we made some adjustments especially with carl melegrito giving up his offense so he could focus on dysam
7459826 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7459827 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7459828 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognize the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7459829 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7459830 this is a multi year financial commitment to the children in the big brothers big sisters of greater miami program and their educational needs
7459831 with this generous gift we are now able to offer the young people in our program the financial support to further their education thereby motivating them to graduate high school what an incredible opportunity for them and for this community

7459835 we hope the enclosure will be built and the animals installed by the end of this year
7459836 these animals will be used for the bilby educational program in the short term but we hope that by taking on these animals we will later get female bilbies and also be included in a breeding program contributing to saving the bilby
7459837 the save the bilby fund supports the three main aims of the national recovery plan for bilbies which includes research into the biology and ecology of the species identifies the reasons of the population decline direct management efforts towards addressing threatening processes and looks at plans to re establish their populations

7459850 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7459851 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7459852 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7459853 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7459854 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7459855 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years

7459858 the policies meet monthly mortgage costs should an accident sickness or unemployment occur and the unemployment criterion is generally interpreted as being made unemployed by your employer however those opting to leave their job because of circumstances beyond their control ie caring are also covered
7459859 over two million people start caring every year and i fear a number of them may have mppi but do not realise they can claim on their policy as a result theyre missing out and suffering financial hardship
7459860 whilst this isnt a long term solution it does provide a temporary mortgage repayment financial safety net in that first year and will help people keep their homes and give them time to sort out their finances
7459861 this type of cover could make a huge difference so its vital people check their policies the state isnt always going to hand out money insurers need to be more socially responsible and help where they can

7459961 the dromin water supply from the river feale is 10 miles further downstream from the landslide and is much bigger so more dilution has occurred weve been able to take water from there and treat it there so that people can use it as normal
7459962 a cry for defense of womens orders in the high middle ages
7459963 argues that this ordo was established by jesus himself and not by the apostles specifically rejecting the teaching that only the male priesthood and diaconate were part of the original church further this ordo predates even the lord in the great jewish women of hebrew scripture and in anna and in elizabeth whom abelard dramatically described as prophets to the prophets
