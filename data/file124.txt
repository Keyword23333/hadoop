1240025 there were lots of dogs and they have left lots of things behind and nobody even tried to collect them
1240026 i have no idea how i can train in such conditions who would clean the discus after every throw
1240027 well son as you have not the time to build the antics website while at college ill just assume the position
1240028 and you can keep in touch with your lecturers through this thing
1240029 at computerworld i personally find the premise that logs help with breach notification mandates to be a perfect no brainer but it looks like some people consider it to be deep insight
1240030 logs are essential for compliance with breach notification laws because you know who exactly to notify proper log keeping will save massive amounts of money while complying with both the letter and the spirit of this law
1240031 takes the 2 spot after being live for only a few days yes we all like to point out other peoples problems especially when they are epically huge

1240033 five questions to ask before sending your data in the cloud
1240034 this is indeed a big deal well it will be soon and you will be hearing more about this
1240035 ten reasons you will be unhappy with your sim solution
1240036 from rebecca herold is a nice basic piece especially for those outside the circle of logging literati

1240038 our song is the best thing that has ever been done in terms of music
1240039 will a business still run if a sysadmin is hit by a bus
1240040 specifically upon outlining some problems with logging i will now forecast what will happen with them in 18 24 months
1240041 the complexity in security is not from any complexity in technology but the complexity in motivating people to truly care about security and act accordingly
1240042 les principales inqui tudes portent pour linstant sur des coupures de courant et des inondations dans les rues
1240043 collectively the fortune 500 is the worlds largest job board they have all the jobs they attract the most job candidates so it just makes sense for them to collaborate resources and help each other save money
1240044 continuous recruitment exchange that is always on bringing you opportunities while you stay anonymous
1240045 you dont have to search through any postings receive unwanted messages and alerts you will only be contacted when employers want to talk with you
1240046 there are many other mechanisms of accountability in an organization but logs are the one that pervades all it and if your it is not accountable your business is neither thus if you tend to not be serious about logs be aware that you are not serious about accountability is that the message your organization wants to be sending the presentation will cover how logs can be used organization wide to establish accountability of users power users other it as well as partners and others accessing systems and using your information how to you make sure your users are accountable for their actions how can you track their activities if needed how can auditors review the audit trails of various activities broad organization wide log collection and analysis is the way to solve these and other problems related to accountability
1240047 90 of all statistics can be made to say anything 50 of the time aka my thoughts on the verizon report
1240048 in 82 percent of cases our investigators noted that the victim possessed the ability to discover the breach had they had they been more diligent in monitoring and analyzing event related information ac i e logs available to them at the time of the incident
1240049 furthermore a crime scene devoid of any network and system logs a key resource for computer forensics is a disturbingly common occurrence
1240050 ah come on i am sure the journalists are just mis reporting it nobody is that dumb in their approach to system security
1240051 while i had always been prepared to hear that one of my sons died by way of a firefight or a roadside bomb i was dumbstruck to hear that my son was electrocuted while taking a shower in his living quarters
1240052 youre hired on at a new company placed in charge of securing their online business websites you know next to nothing about the technical details of the infrastructure other than they have no existing web software security program and a significant portion of the organizations revenues are generated through their websites what is the very first thing do on day 1
1240053 ive been asked to look into finding a replacement to our current log management auditing system
1240054 youre hired on at a new company placed in charge of taking control over the logs you know next to nothing about the technical details of the infrastructure other than they have no existing log management process and tools what is the very first thing do on day 1
1240055 both related to terry child case as well as a response to
1240056 what is anton up to isnt it kind of obvious that controls are for everybody
1240057 what rankles your readers is how blithely you imply this problem has a simple or effective solution it doesnt all the processes or tools you advocate can do is speed up the time it takes to detect the lock out but not actually prevent it i e they are ineffective at tackling the primary problem
1240058 we all know companies run without sane risk management all the time and are rarely held accountable in america
1240059 you seem to forget that sometimes the management just has to trust somebody
1240060 chuvakin youre a tool given the recent idiocy of the releasing of the vpn names and codes it obviously shows that any sort of detest that childs had against his superiors at the city were justified
1240061 this is not a private organization his superiors dont own the company and are not entitled to the data we are the taxpayers and as a california taxpayer i fully support someone with the paranoia and technical skill of terry childs over a group of bureaucrats who release secure information to the public
1240062 the guy was doing his job and doing it incredibly well and keeping it out of the hands of those who given their most recent choices would bring potential disaster to the city
1240063 anton chuvakin seems to think that all admins should be kept underneath managements boot at all times managers cant and dont understand what we do and thus eventually come to the conclusion that we cant be trusted with our own knowledge perhaps its human nature to fear what you dont know or understand and thats why management can develop a fear of their own employees
1240064 his blog leads the casual reader to infer that their businesses are in danger of being hijacked by disgruntled sys admins and that isnt the case
1240065 i despise people like terry childs but despise chicken littles like anton chuvakin even more
1240066 if your boss ignores insider risk management he is stupid and deserves his business to fail
1240067 if you think admins are above the law you have a good chance of turning rogue yourself and then ending in jail

1240096 there are safety procedures to follow when removing redundant track from beside the railway line which porretta did not follow
1240097 a piece of rail track could have struck a passing train and caused a serious rail incident fortunately this did not happen
1240098 we hope that it sends out a strong message that this type of crime will not be tolerated
1240099 the fact that this man has received a substantial prison sentence should serve as a warning to any thieves who steal from the railway infrastructure

1240111 quello di youdem sar innanzitutto un grande esperimento creativo le cui parole chiave saranno innovazione e sperimentazione

1240114 quella di mettere insieme tanti mezzi comunicativi che agiscano contemporaneamente il piano industriale della rai daltronde sottolinea dimostra che ormai il pubblico televisivo ha unet media di 57 anni
1240115 che avr costi compatibili con il bilancio del pd sostiene veltroni e che contribuir a fare ritrovare il profilo di innovazione al partito
1240116 sono due cose diverse che possono interagire tranquillamente non c una tv veltroniana e una dalemiana cos come non c uno scontro tra veltroni e dalema questo schema dei duellanti piace molto ai giornalisti ma non questo il problema del paese

1240132 in making it the bennett group is attempting to create a sideshow to obscure the core issue of the case that clay bennett and his partners were dishonest when they negotiated the deal
1240133 invoking their names in this case is merely an attempt by the bennett groups attorneys to resurrect a theme that served them well in the city case and to defocus attention from the main issue bcos is litigating fraudulent behavior by their clients
1240134 given the connection between the citys lawyers and this lawsuit it is not a stretch to conclude that the bifurcation proposal is primarily intended to ensure that if the team returns it does so only after the 2009 10 season

1240139 the idea that the team cant play in oklahoma city for one or two years is incorrect because the hornets did just that

1240153 the maintenance initiatives outlined by hwac include action that can be performed both by home owners or maintenance firms procured by them to periodically service key items of equipment
1240154 these are the most costly items in a home and the ones likely to require proper maintenance
1240155 to minimize potential service denials home owners with home warranty contracts are well advised to follow manufacturer recommended maintenance guidelines on respective home components in addition potential home warranty customers should ask about contract limitations on lack of maintenance and pre existing conditions all home warranty companies exclude known pre existing conditions however in some cases if the condition was not known by any parties and not detectable by visible inspection and simple mechanical test it may be considered covered by the terms of coverage

1240157 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1240158 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1240159 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1240160 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it

1240164 the technology behind anti virus today is highly inefficient when it comes to protecting against modernized threats
1240165 this is fueled by the fact that vendors simply cant keep up with all of the new malware surfacing each and every day the situation has created a breakdown in the quality and effectiveness of their underlying core technology
1240166 home buyers are starting to get off the fence and into the market drawn by drops in home prices in many areas and armed with greater access to affordable mortgages
1240167 todays buyer plans to stay in a home for 10 years a good strategy for building long term wealth
1240168 the large supply of homes on the market clearly favors buyers and it should take several months to draw the inventory down significantly stabilization in home prices can only occur with buyers returning to the market so we are encouraged by rising home sales particularly in distressed markets
1240169 the recently released s amp p case shiller house price indexes for april offer a few surprises

1240189 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1240190 we have not completed our process on these soil samples
1240191 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1240192 may have migrated from the spacecraft either into samples or into the instrumentation
1240193 when surprising results are found we want to review and assure our extensive pre launch contamination control processes covered this potential
1240194 the way the wet chemistry lab works is we measure in the solution anions and cations and thats what weve done
1240195 piecing them together and saying which goes with which is a tough job
1240196 and were just not prepared at this point to say what that is
1240197 there are some particularly interesting properties of magnesium perchlorate and im not suggesting in any way thats what we have but we are looking at the properties of all of these and the answer is we still dont know the things we can measure are magnesium potassium sodium and indirectly calicum and there may be others theyre all interesting and fascinating in their own right
1240198 there are some signatures that have not been interpreted yet
1240199 the soil is turning out to be different than what was expected its alkaline and has these salts in it so its a substance that were not familiar with and its different than what mers have found
1240200 there is a lot more work that needs to be done before we have any real conclusion about whats in the soil
1240201 sources say the new data do not indicate the discovery of existing or past life on mars rather the data relate to habitability the potential for mars to support life at the phoenix arctic landing site
1240202 ruled out the possibility of life on red planet at this point of time but it will brief the white house regarding potential of life on mars
1240203 the spacecraft has however found the presence of bacteria on the surface of red planet
1240204 it has really been a science experiment just learning how to interact with the icy soil on mars how it reacts with the scoop its stickiness whether its better to have it in the shade or the sunlight
1240205 hope to answer the question is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water over time and the materials that are the basic ingredients for life forms
1240206 it will be for future missions to find if anybodys home in this environment but we will be finding out if this is a place to search for life forms throughout next two months of approved mission
1240207 we have finished complete panorama in full color and in stereoscopic view so we actually have a topography now of the landscape around us
1240208 we are following the nasa guidelines of looking for water on mars we expected to find water at this landing site and thats why we came here mars odyssey discovered regional water supplies in 2006 but we are very pleased to see that we landed right on top of ice and the thrusters spread the soil away and revealed ice right underneath our lander this was not expected the water could have been all around us and not within reach we had no way of knowing on the local scale of how the ice is distributed
1240209 that witch saw her final demise by being pushed into an oven
1240210 we see these clay like components very small particles that have unexpected properties as we found when we tried to scoop some up and deliver to one of our prime instruments we just getting to point where we can apply another tool that takes resolution down by a factor of 40 over the microscopic pictures we have shown the atomic force microscope and well be using the extended mission to do that science
1240211 we expected summer period to be fairly calm and have not seen any major weather system pass by
1240212 we have not been seeing significant changes day to day apart from pressure
1240213 were seeing a slow daily decrease in pressure related to condensation of a significant part of co2 carbon dioxide on southern pole which is to be expected
1240214 the hydrogen peroxide or new oxidants that get produced from the electrical storms will be in the regolith but if there is any life below the surface it will not be affected by this antiseptic thats there
1240215 might it be possible for some microbial life to be up there
1240216 would finding life surprise me finding it would astonish me because it would not be easy to find even with the experiments were doing now
1240217 im not even sure if we took a sample of dirt from outside this building here in tucson wed find it
1240218 we could probably find some organics with tega but even that would not mean theres life most of the time if i took a sample of dry soil and put it in a microscope i probably wouldnt see things crawling around
1240219 the likelihood of life on mars is that its not sitting up there on the surface waiting for us to scoop it up thats probably not a hospitable habitat for life with all the ultraviolet radiation and the wild temperature swings at the surface
1240220 you can have some interesting speculation about where life might hide on mars
1240221 but i dont think its just out there waiting for to scoop it up and detect it
1240222 as we get to the part of the mission where we do the scientific analysis of the soil and contact with ice this does take some time and we still have not collected all our data
1240223 we are looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice had ever melted and through melting has created the liquid environment that modifies soils changes chemistry and the microscopic appearance of these soils were just getting the data back
1240224 vamos a volver a trabajar fundamentalmente en recomponer todas las alianzas vamos a hablar con todos y arrancaremos la semana que viene cuando terminen las vacaciones de invierno
1240225 de ninguna manera va a ser candidato a diputado o senador el a o pr ximo porque no hace falta

1240227 con actividades que tendr n como eje central el armado de las listas de cara al 2009
1240228 propuse volver a colocar la idea del gasoducto del sur creo que es momento de retomarlo
1240229 hemos coincidido en la necesidad de crear empresas estatales con capitales de los tres pa ses en sectores como el petroqu mico y el energ tico
1240230 los tres presidentes tuvieron la posibilidad de hablar de la situaci n regional y del unasur
1240231 somos tres pa ses que nos complementamos de manera espectacular es un eje que se est conformando el eje central del sur del cual va a depender la din mica de la estructuraci n
1240232 el plan imperialista de globalizar el mundo fracaso por eso estamos frente a una crisis alimentaria financiera y moral esta integraci n busca enfrentar esos dilemas

1240235 i can attest that passage of this legislation would not have been possible without representative loves support
1240236 the most important piece of legislation the north carolina general assembly has enacted in many years aimed toward the protection of our children from sexual predators
1240237 within the international ict industry we see increasing attention paid by the larger corporate and public sector organisations to their own carbon reduction and energy efficiency strategies we also see an increasing volume of individual supplier sponsored studies addressing the corporate ict user needs the time has now come to address the business user communitys needs from an expert independent impartial perspective
1240238 our members are spending over 13 billion each year on ict to enable and enhance their business processes and they see the use of ict as offering a solution through the carbon intent initiative we propose to draw together and share examples of current best practice from video conferencing to logistics and transport planning to home working the aim is to create industry wide guidelines and benchmarks that any ict professional anywhere can tap into for assistance working with the carbon trust has made this pilot stage possible
1240239 theres a line that doesnt even need to be there
1240240 yeah if we didnt work together we probably wouldnt even see each other
1240241 this investment is the result of successful trials with several large pharmaceutical companies and will be used to build our first rapid analysis machines the industry response has been strong because the technology can cut the costs of mandatory testing as well as reduce manufacturing lead time this is a superb example of how cutting edge science can provide direct solutions for key industrial problems
1240242 this is a very exciting time for us at stfc and litethru i am particularly pleased with the vibrant and stimulating environment at stfc enabling us to make effective use of new ideas and discoveries for the direct benefit of our society
1240243 as fortuny picked up his cat and settled into an eames style chair i asked whether trolling hurt people
1240244 im not going to sit here and say oh god please forgive me so someone can feel better
1240245 am i the bad guy am i the big horrible person who shattered someones life with some information no this is life welcome to life everyone goes through it ive been through horrible stuff too
1240246 he proceeded to demonstrate his personal cure for trolling the theory of the green hair
1240247 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
1240248 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
1240249 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
1240250 trolling will not end as soon as we all get over it any more than rape will end when women get over it or racism will end when black and brown people get over it
1240251 3 n o provocar e n o responder a provoca es de outros clans
1240252 with working memory youre just keeping it active until you use it
1240253 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol
1240254 rats treated with estradiol are definitely a lot more active and make a lot more lever presses
1240255 women take them thinking theyll be a safe alternative to hormone replacement therapy and they might help hot flashes
1240256 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
1240257 by the time they reach eight years old theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
1240258 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early
1240259 information on family history and the dietary and exercise habits in infancy
1240260 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend
1240261 in distressed and downtrodden neighborhoods homeownership is a catalyst for political participation and neighborhood revitalization
1240262 by engaging residents in local issues homeownership contributes to the re empowerment of urban communities
1240263 contextual factors moderating the relationship between homeownership and voting among low income households
1240264 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
1240265 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
1240266 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
1240267 it is possible that nano particles of precious metals are suitable candidates for catalysts in important reactions in the chemical industry
1240268 seven uncharged gold atoms form a triangle with an additional vertex
1240269 uncharged gold atoms probably prefer this structure as it is easier for the electrons to avoid each other
1240270 the clusters are rather unstable you cant just buy them as a powder
1240271 this means we have to repeat the experiment with around 200 different wavelengths of the infrared laser
1240272 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
1240273 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
1240274 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
1240275 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
1240276 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
1240277 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1240278 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1240279 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1240280 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1240281 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
1240282 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1240283 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1240284 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
1240285 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
1240286 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
1240287 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
1240288 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
1240289 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
1240290 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses
1240291 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
1240292 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
1240293 with creativity and political will the progress and individualized approach to antiretroviral therapy evident in the developed world can be adapted to the public health approach in the developing world where 90 percent of the worlds hiv infected population lives
1240294 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
1240295 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
1240296 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
1240297 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1240298 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1240299 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1240300 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1240301 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1240302 these results mean that the tevatron experiments are very much in the game for finding the higgs
1240303 in the past year alone the two experiments have produced 77 ph d s and 100 publications that advance the state of our knowledge across the span of particle physics at the energy frontier
1240304 the discovery of the higgs boson would answer one of the big questions in physics today
1240305 we have not heard the last from the tevatron experiments
1240306 college attendance is commonly associated with self improvement and upward mobility yet this research suggests that college may actually encourage rather than deter social deviance and risk taking
1240307 juvenile delinquency college attendance and the paradoxical role of higher education in crime and substance use
1240308 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
1240309 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
1240310 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
1240311 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
1240312 the discovery of reliable behavioral endpoints with predictive validity even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved can significantly improve intervention research
1240313 until september 1988 the secretariat headed the cpsus central apparatus and was solely responsible for the development and implementation of party policies the secretariat also carried political weight because many of its members sat on the politburo in 1989 eight members of the secretariat including the general secretary of the secretariat of the central committee of the cpsu served as full members of the politburo
1240314 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1240315 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1240316 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
1240317 pc unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the us economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
1240318 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
1240319 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1240320 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1gb of dram has declined by 43 during the past year while the price of 2gb of nand flash has declined by 61 in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150
1240321 the impact of advanced technology on energy efficiency is even more dramatic
1240322 a recent independent study showed that computers have become nearly 3 million percent more energy efficient over the past 30 years
1240323 a train of thought about human endeavor built on an outrageous groove

1240332 im not saying that there are not more addictive drugs
1240333 my defenition of addiction is that people do it all the time to their own detriment
1240334 compulsive need for and use of a habit forming substance
1240335 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
1240336 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
1240337 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1240338 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1240339 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1240340 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1240341 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life
1240342 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1240343 our information for this is that everything was working okay

1240350 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1240351 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1240352 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1240353 is that for women they should become more jealous if there is some sign that their partner is becoming emotionally involved with another woman
1240354 this other woman gets an opportunity to display her caring skills and her caretaking skills
1240355 and there is maybe some danger that her husband will develop an emotional attachment to that other woman
1240356 there for a reason you have to watch out for being hypersensitive which can stop being functional and start to become a self fulfilling prophecy

1240361 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1240362 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1240363 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1240364 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1240365 the city has some of the worst congestion in china we were worried there would be traffic difficulties and also that the crowds would be too large
1240366 in the next round its different because you can say youve got the uefa cup but that doesnt make it any better if you dont get there
1240367 its like everything else youve just got to win your games and make sure you do enough to get through
1240368 we didnt do enough in the first leg we werent bright enough and weve got to be in the second leg we know what we have to do and i dont think you can approach the game with any great fear
1240369 we can approach it with confidence because if we play well enough we know we can go through
1240370 it gets to you just after the season finishes when you realise youre going to have to face the qualifiers before youre really up and running and thats the worst part of it but it happens and youve just got to get on with it and you have to be ready for it
1240371 our players have had a realisation of what they have had to do in games but as i keep saying to you last seasons part of it doesnt count
1240372 the knowledge that they gained and the confidence they gained from playing last year can have an effect plus if we start to play at the same level as we did last year
1240373 well have to do that to get through this game well have to play at a really good level to get through and thats up to us to ensure we do that
1240374 i dont know whether thats as good as kaunas can play i just know that we can play better than we did in that game and thats what well have to do concentrate on our own performance and thats what well do
1240375 never mind whats happened before it is an awkward place to come and play theyre in their season were not
1240376 all of that is there weve got to overcome any problems were having at the present moment if were going to go through
1240377 i havent had a chance to speak to craig myself i was made aware of it after the game as i was in the players tunnel
1240378 an official from ipswich made me aware something had happened

1240392 thank you you have been a stalwart youve done an awesome job you have educated so many people
1240393 if we dont take action now we settle for nothing later well settle for nothing now and well settle for nothing later
1240394 give a damn about the world you live in give a damn about what you and i both know is one of the most shameful and destructive periods in american history if so do something about it you can start by reading
1240395 dave berman has been candid and confrontational in challenging all of us to be
1240396 dave bermans work is quietly brilliant and powerfully utilitarian his voter confidence resolution provides a fine flexible tool whereby any community can reclaim and affirm a right relation to its franchise as a community of voters
1240397 whats special about this book and it fits because theres nothing more fundamental to democracy than our vote is the raising of consciousness someone recognizing they have no basis for trusting elections may well ask what else is being taken for granted

1240425 the israeli government is waging war against the palestinian economy the aim of the siege is to destroy what remains of the palestinian agricultural sector in order to increase the dependence of the gaza strip on israeli products
1240426 the permission to allow the export of limited quantities of strawberries was a smoke screen at best we exported less than 9 of our produce and part of this allowed export expired at the karm abu salem crossing due to the prolonged wait of the produce directly under the sun our lives have been poisoned we farm the land then we destroy the crop or sell it dirt cheap i do not know if i will farm my land again i own 50 dunums of land planted with potatoes most probably i wont be able to spray it with insecticides that are not available insects and disease will undoubtedly destroy the crop

1240453 sags negotiators have not discussed with us any plan to reach an agreement and the only meeting the parties are attempting to schedule is one to resolve some outstanding grievance claims no meetings formal or informal regarding these negotiations have taken place since the sidebar sag requested on july 16 and no meetings are pending

1240465 estamos impuls ndolo el contenido de la reforma constitucional por la v a de las leyes
1240466 el gobierno porque le dio la gana sac estas 26 leyes y las meti de contrabando y en la noche aspectos a los que ya el pueblo venezolano de manera clara dijo que no
1240467 por encima del tribunal supremo de justicia hay un tribunal que no tiene ninguna falla que es el tribunal del pueblo venezolano y ese tribunal del pueblo ya dijo que no a todos estos conceptos trueque propiedad colectiva propiedad directa propiedad indirecta y estoy hablando solamente de una de las leyes
1240468 ya veremos lo que vaya saliendo de las otras leyes que tienen que ver con lo que est sucediendo en la administraci n p blica con los bancos con todo lo que tiene que ver con la econom a del pa s
1240469 el gobierno debe m s bien generar confianza generar reglas del juego claras que permita que se genere empleo en el pa s esto lo que hace es que el pueblo venezolano sufra porque en la medida en la que se siga destruyendo la econom a se sigue destruyendo el empleo y la oportunidad de todos los venezolanos
1240470 lo m s importante ahorita es conocer lo que esta ac en este contrabando que el pa s lo conozca que el pa s sepa que todo lo que esta aqu planteado ya lo rechaz el 2 de diciembre de 2007
1240471 el pa s tiene que saber que as como echamos para atr s
1240472 la constituci n establece que todas las leyes que se hagan por ley habilitante tienen que ser consultadas por el gobierno al pueblo y la nica consulta que se hizo al respecto el pueblo fue claro y dijo no no queremos esta reforma y mucho menos la queremos de contrabando
1240473 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
1240474 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
1240475 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
1240476 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
1240477 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
1240478 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
1240479 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
1240480 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
1240481 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1240482 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1240483 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit
1240484 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
1240485 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
1240486 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
1240487 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1240488 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices
1240489 there is little to nothing that freddie mac could have done to prevent the losses that it is now incurring
1240490 had i not put my foot down had i just gone along with it and not said regulations were being violated im sure id still be there
1240491 it appears to me that weve struck the right balance consistent with the wishes of the family
1240492 the policy has not changed and i understand the practice hasnt either
1240493 please change your title from public affairs director to public affairs officer
1240494 mr metzler changed his mind i will continue as your supervisor
1240495 than to lose the weight like you did and to look in the mirror and say four words
1240496 that the biggest side effect is im hardly stressed over anything
1240497 im not 268 pounds anymore and im still not a jock but i am fit
1240498 im still waiting to get picked for the congressional basketball team
1240499 apparently he wants to spend more time spying on his family
1240500 i could recite a number of examples of where the former attorney general made me very proud of the decisions he made or some of the things that he said
1240501 i also mr ashcroft mr attorney general want to commend you for your willingness to appear before this committee
1240502 i think it says a lot about you in a positive way
1240503 i think you are probably the most formidable witness i have experienced
1240504 there is no room in the justice department for an assumption that its work is perfect
1240505 there is no exception that i know of that allows people to violate the law
1240506 i dont think i could under oath say that ive never had a second thought about it
1240507 were very proud to welcome him back again to the house judiciary committee
1240508 general ashcroft is we know a man of the law who is willing to stand up and take tough and courageous positions
1240509 overly simplistic approaches that say everything were doing is right really as a matter of fact theyre dangerous
1240510 you know im just right now next to standing up and singing the national anthem
1240511 i think admiral cosgriff who made that statement is making an accurate statement
1240512 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically
1240513 i have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically
1240514 i think the iranians have to believe that we will use force if necessary and im concerned because you had statements for a period of time there from people like the commander in centcom who has since been relieved suggesting that force was off the table
1240515 everything we can to dispel this idea that somehow we dont have the capacity militarily to take action
1240516 despite what you may be hearing from congress despite what you may be hearing from others in the administration who might be saying force isnt on the table that were serious
1240517 i certainly dont think that we should do anything but support them
1240518 mercer countys growth spurt report population swells in several townships but not in trenton
1240519 we all should do our homework and wise up not either dems or republicans
1240520 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1240521 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1240522 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1240523 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1240524 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1240525 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1240526 this average man in the street this man in the textile mill the steelworker the beautician the barber the policeman on the beat
1240527 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1240528 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1240529 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1240530 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1240531 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1240532 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1240533 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1240534 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1240535 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1240536 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1240537 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1240538 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1240539 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1240540 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1240541 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1240542 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1240543 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1240544 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1240545 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1240546 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1240547 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1240548 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1240549 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1240550 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1240551 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1240552 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1240553 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1240554 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1240555 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
1240556 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1240557 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1240558 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1240559 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1240560 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1240561 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1240562 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1240563 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1240564 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1240565 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1240566 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1240567 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1240568 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1240569 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1240570 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1240571 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1240572 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1240573 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
1240574 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
1240575 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
1240576 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
1240577 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
1240578 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
1240579 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
1240580 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
1240581 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
1240582 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
1240583 durch die einf hrung selbstausl schender zigaretten lassen sich in der eu pro jahr mindestens 2000 menschenleben retten
1240584 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1240585 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1240586 es ist einfach seine unertr gliche arroganz sein auftreten als graf rotz die ihm nun zum verh ngnis wurde
1240587 dass irgendwann einigen nicht mehr klar ist dass es um das ringen um positionen geht und nicht um innerparteiliche streitereien und dass es im zweifelsfall um das ringen mit dem politischen gegner geht und nicht mit dem politischen freund
1240588 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1240589 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1240590 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1240591 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1240592 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1240593 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1240594 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1240595 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1240596 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1240597 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1240598 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1240599 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1240600 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1240601 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1240602 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1240603 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1240604 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
1240605 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
1240606 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
1240607 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
1240608 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
1240609 presents a vivid alarming profile of americas current financial status
1240610 the story of americas four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
1240611 suggestions for how best to recreate a fiscally sound nation for future generations
1240612 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1240613 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1240614 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
1240615 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
1240616 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
1240617 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1240618 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1240619 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1240620 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1240621 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1240622 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1240623 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1240624 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1240625 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1240626 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1240627 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1240628 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1240629 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1240630 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1240631 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1240632 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1240633 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1240634 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1240635 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1240636 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1240637 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1240638 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1240639 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1240640 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1240641 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1240642 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1240643 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1240644 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1240645 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1240646 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1240647 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1240648 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1240649 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1240650 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1240651 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1240652 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1240653 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
1240654 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1240655 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1240656 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1240657 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1240658 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1240659 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1240660 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1240661 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1240662 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1240663 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
1240664 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
1240665 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
1240666 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
1240667 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
1240668 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1240669 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
1240670 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1240671 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
1240672 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1240673 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1240674 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1240675 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1240676 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1240677 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1240678 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1240679 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1240680 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1240681 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1240682 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1240683 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1240684 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1240685 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1240686 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1240687 i really feel that the highest and best use of whatever talents i have in my life
1240688 im devoting my life trying to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines that supports the massive policy changes we need to have
1240689 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd as to not warrant a reply
1240690 we ought to make a commitment as a country to get 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy sources
1240691 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1240692 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1240693 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1240694 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1240695 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1240696 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1240697 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1240698 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1240699 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1240700 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1240701 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1240702 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1240703 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1240704 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1240705 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1240706 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1240707 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1240708 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1240709 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1240710 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1240711 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1240712 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1240713 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1240714 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1240715 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1240716 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1240717 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1240718 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1240719 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1240720 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1240721 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1240722 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1240723 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1240724 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and keep the pressure on this enemy and bring em to justice so they dont hurt the american citizen again
1240725 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1240726 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1240727 that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1240728 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1240729 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1240730 at john mccains campaign you cant spit without hitting a big money lobbyist who is raising money for or staffing his campaign mccainslobbyists com shows just how much mccain is embedded in and wedded to the old web of corruption in washington dc
1240731 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1240732 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1240733 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1240734 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1240735 inflation is intensifying and that is the main source of weakness in consumer spending
1240736 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1240737 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1240738 unlike obama in illinois sen hillary clinton voted to support the 2002 federal bill
1240739 in fact the bill passed the senate 98 to 0 with pro abortion senators like boxer d ca and reid d nv supporting it
1240740 deal hudson has been one of the leading proponents of this language thats very corrosive
1240741 his rhetoric has been corrosive for catholic values with these broadside attacks that are disingenuous and unethical the parallel would be to say mccain wants children to die of infectious diseases because he voted against s chip
1240742 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
1240743 the congress doing nothing decided to go on a five week recess said mccain
1240744 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1240745 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1240746 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1240747 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1240748 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1240749 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
1240750 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
1240751 we will not back down we will not slow down we are in this for the long haul
1240752 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd
1240753 i salute him for that challenge it is absolutely possible to do so
1240754 i think nuclear will play a role i dont think it will be a large increase
1240755 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1240756 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1240757 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1240758 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1240759 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1240760 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1240761 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1240762 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
1240763 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1240764 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
1240765 you know its not about you its about your country
1240766 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1240767 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1240768 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1240769 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1240770 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1240771 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1240772 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1240773 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1240774 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1240775 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1240776 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1240777 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1240778 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1240779 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1240780 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1240781 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1240782 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1240783 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1240784 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1240785 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1240786 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1240787 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1240788 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1240789 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1240790 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1240791 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1240792 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1240793 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1240794 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1240795 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1240796 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1240797 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1240798 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1240799 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1240800 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1240801 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1240802 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1240803 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1240804 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1240805 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1240806 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1240807 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1240808 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1240809 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1240810 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1240811 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1240812 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1240813 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1240814 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1240815 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1240816 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
1240817 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
1240818 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
1240819 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
1240820 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
1240821 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
1240822 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
1240823 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1240824 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place

1240828 that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1240829 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1240830 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1240831 at john mccains campaign you cant spit without hitting a big money lobbyist who is raising money for or staffing his campaign mccainslobbyists com shows just how much mccain is embedded in and wedded to the old web of corruption in washington dc

1240847 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
1240848 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue

1240856 if you look at it as an entrance to the community of squirrel hill it would be nice if it was a building that is aesthetically pleasing
1240857 did you know that your government has increased aid to the palestinian authority
1240858 it wasnt so long ago jewish labor supporters were arguing there was no difference between liberal and labor policy towards israel and jews who attended private dinners with kevin rudd were led to believe labor would continue to support israel
1240859 this letter writer will be watching for the next arab muslim backed un anti israel resolution to see if rudd stands by his commitment to the jewish community
1240860 we have seen no sign of any subtle let alone significant shift of australian policy on the middle east and the daley article offers no new evidence that any such change is occurring we are satisfied that the australian government maintains a strong positive commitment to a secure israel and to the pursuit of a viable and lasting two state peace

1240907 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1240908 ill stand out there in the rainstorm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you have to get the fans out of there we have to be out there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will
1240909 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1240910 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1240911 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1240912 this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
1240913 i dont really want to be here at midnight but thats our job thats what you do when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game

1240919 i think i would like your nose first no i have plenty of nose myself i have been following you ever since you killed my husband toes perhaps i do love cutting off the odd toe you see i was rather fond of my husband and i took it rather personally when you killed him i know what you have that i dont a penis can i have that off with scissors perhaps i have been following you for months admiring your work
1240920 what about if we start big like say with your leg im impressed you see with your facility at killing people swiftly
1240921 but i would dearly like to start small with a smaller appendage so that you feel it more
1240922 there were various reports of funnel clouds within the city limits but there were no confirmed tornadoes in chicago
1240923 crews from our bureaus of forestry and electricity are out as a precaution but storm damage will be slow to roll in until people emerge from their homes to spot damage
1240924 in some places power outages will make it difficult for people to see if there has been damage in their immediate vicinity

1240999 if there is no meaning to our lives then there is no meaning to the universe and if everything is meaningless then thats justification fr doing anything you want murder included because it doesnt matter right
1241000 so what would point to a creator to you if there was no disease crime suffering or poverty would god need to speak to you directly

1241008 gods gonna getcha if you dont believe this circular argument
1241009 why would god create creatures to worship him and if we dont were punished
1241010 so do you believe what you read in science journals history books the newspaper wikipedia it seems you are biased against the evidence for reasons other than the fact that it is written by men

1241105 they came to us and told us later that didak was in the car we are going to have a little bit of time to work through things and reconsider the situation
1241106 we have tried our best to be as honest as we can with everybody with the information that we had in front of us
1241107 and now that we have new evidence in front of us we will consider that in the cool light of day and make a decision
1241108 the situation i think was that they were looking after alan after your paper slaughtered him last year

1241115 tour de france runner up cadel evans could miss beijing summer olympics after he pulled out on thursday after injuring his knee when he slipped on a wet floor at a team dinner in paris
1241116 nobody has a better poker face than him i know it pisses you reporters off but i respect him so much and his ability just to stay the same all the time
1241117 hes not too high hes not too low i think when youre like that when youre up and down and all over the place and ive been with guys like that players read through that and if youre panicking and youre pressing they see that thats going to make them panic and press so its business as usual for us
1241118 i actually dont read the papers or watch the news and stuff like that but i hear it still were out there and were going to play hard every play do what we always do and play football
1241119 i dont think its any different than its been in the past
1241120 we all have the same common goal weve had here every year that coach willingham has been here and thats to win games that hasnt changed and that never will
1241121 theres a whole new attitude new defensive coordinator ed donatell brought in he just installed in all of us that were just going to have fun
1241122 i think were getting close its going to be interesting in camp to see how some of the speed and explosiveness that we have starts to fit together to see how the confidence builds and how they feed off each other
1241123 all of that is external and we cant focus on the external factors
1241124 in house its business as usual you cant ignore the questions but we love willingham and we want to fight for him

1241129 they were asking for a middle linebacker and nobody else stepped up i always felt i could play there why not showcase more of my talents at a camp where all the coaches were watching i stepped into that role and just ran with it
1241130 i lead by example so when im not able to do what i feel im best at mentally it really got to me
1241131 im not going to lie i got a little selfish and started thinking about me me me i think i let some of my teammates and coaches down i wasnt being my normal self
1241132 thats why this summer i definitely took it upon myself to say this is about the team lets get it done and im back guys
1241133 donalds a really assertive funny type dude hes easy to get along with and keeps guys in check when he needs to he really pushed us all to work hard this summer i know for me hes really helped me become the player i am now
1241134 obviously donald will be a tremendous factor in our defense
1241135 i think everybody knows this is the year where we need to produce lets put it that way

1241159 its hard to comment but it worked for us and i think if you asked steve johnson it worked for him
1241160 its that and dealing with not only the embarrassment of the public but i think the hardest thing is standing in front of your team mates and telling them youve let them down
1241161 as far as the practice i thought it was really good for our guys getting to go against somebody else
1241162 we picked up the tempo and the intensity it was a really clean day and we look forward to coming back again this afternoon and getting after it again
1241163 it is interesting to see our individual guys respond and be competitive in different environments
1241164 that is what we push for every day for our guys to compete the way they do regardless of who they are going against
1241165 it was nice to see a different color jersey standing across from you it was good to ease up on our own teammates and go against other guys

1241351 i didnt want to be a physician it didnt attract me
1241352 im not retiring im only starting working on all kinds of projects we have our own company maimonidex in tel aviv that makes antibodies against rheumatoid arthritis and i continue to teach
1241353 tumors are like any other tissue but unfortunately the immune systems reaction to cancer is weaker than to bacteria or other pathogens and often cant be seen as i see it cancer cells know how to deal with the immune system as they divide faster and release toxic materials that act against the immune system which doesnt know how to counterattack our challenge is to understand why the immune reaction to cancer is so weak knowing the answer will be a great advance
1241354 since if only it were possible to induce an autoimmune reaction against cancer cells we could eliminate cancer
1241355 each involves a different antigen so i think there has to be a separate treatment for each just as cancer is a collection of diseases with different treatments depending on the affected organ
1241356 great contributions in the development of antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer
1241357 there is a genetic component but its not 100 if a parent has an autoimmune disease it increases the risk of it being contracted by the child but this is far from inevitable
1241358 we all have several lines of defense if one breaks down and other factors are present autoimmune disease can appear at any time although it happens more frequently as people age
1241359 if a psychiatric manifestation is caused by an autoimmune disease could it be that other psychiatric conditions whose cause we dont yet know are also due to autoimmune diseases
1241360 then we injected the anti depressant fluoxetine prozac into the depressed mice and they swam
1241361 we found that in many psychiatric conditions patients lose their sense of smell opening up the possibility that aromatherapy with certain odors can relieve the condition we tried exposing depressed rats to lemon and citrus fragrances this helped more than antidepressants and the mice started to swim aromatherapy has already been tested in elderly japanese perhaps we will be able to repair depression with good smells
1241362 a sniffing test may even predict who will develop alzheimers we have neglected smell in the treatment of central nervous system disorders
1241363 there is a revolution with biological drugs for autoimmune diseases and the discoveries are also occurring in israel
1241364 as they may afflict not only the elderly but also young people as with multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis treating them has a major economic as well as personal impact successful new medications can help go back to work

1241377 the australian reinvigoration of the industry has not really been successful weve been trying to re mine old deposits
1241378 this industry is dependent on new discoveries and new mines coming on stream and at the moment its not happening
1241379 its very very tough in places like south africa and australia to bring costs down because youre fighting a losing battle given the maturity of the belt that youre mining
1241380 without wanting to just preach our story i think youve got to go to new jurisdictions
1241381 and thats challenging as well because youve got to find those jurisdictions that have geological potential and manageable political risk

1241393 the banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below three per cent during 2010
1241394 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1241395 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1241396 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1241397 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1241398 at the same time high prices of oil and a range of other commodities have added to global inflationary risks
1241399 they are also dampening growth in a number of countries
1241400 given the opposing forces at work considerable uncertainty has surrounded the outlook for demand and inflation
1241401 inflation is likely to remain relatively high in the short term with the cpi affected by high global oil prices
1241402 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate

1241406 he generally supported the maximum wish list of the environmental movement but now his position on drilling is sticking out like a sore thumb
1241407 republicans are getting traction on drilling and it could hurt democrats in the general election
1241408 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1241409 i believe anyone who says we can achieve energy independence without more nuclear power more offshore drilling more clean coal either doesnt have the experience to understand the problem we are faced with or isnt being straightforward with the american people
1241410 if he does really get behind this new compromise in congress i think that would be a huge mistake
1241411 he still doesnt think drilling is the answer and if he was latching onto that rhetoric id be more concerned
1241412 we are disappointed to see that sen obama has expressed openness to compromise on offshore drilling and the health of our beaches when oil savings from his proposals for more efficient vehicles would better serve our needs save consumers money and enhance the economy
1241413 obama said he would be receptive to drilling but not as a solution only as part of a compromise
1241414 they both agree that the long term solution lies not in oil drilling but in development of alternatives
1241415 hes obviously following the leader which is sen mccain in my view hes the one who came there first but kudos to sen obama for that its important to face facts and realize whats going on and try to help people
1241416 while i still dont believe thats a meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan

1241535 they are trying to show that they are taking the leadership of the designers and they are looking to innovate in the areas where there is still room for innovation
1241536 it has been a very static area there is not a lot more that you can do in terms of the functionality but there is always something that can be done about the look and feel of the browser and thats where the public is always happy to see changes

1241543 religion is nothing more than a self developed psychological delusion invented only to explain things in which a weak mind has no desire to figure out on its own and to instill fear into those individuals who may deviate from the societal definition of a moral life
1241544 telebranchen har generelt det problem at det totale marked slet ikke vokser og mobilmarkedet kun langsomt der er tilmed prispres p tale delen s de leder desperat efter nye v kstomr der
1241545 mobilt bredb nd er den helt store v kstmotor i branchen i jeblikket hvis man ser p hvor mange penge selskaberne bruger p reklame for det mobile bredb nd er det tydeligt at det er det omr de de s tter deres lid til fremover
1241546 det bliver interessant at se om mobilt bredb nd faktisk begynder at kannibalisere p fastnetbredb nd vi har jo set der er flere og flere der v lger at droppe deres fastnettelefon for at g over til mobiltelefon
1241547 langt om l nge er 3 ved at v re rigtig gode og vokser men man skal ogs huske p at de jo har haft et naturligt forspring i forhold til deres konkurrenter der f rst kom med p vognen senere

1241549 its always rewarding to witness students experiencing everything our program has to offer not only do we provide an accelerated program with a broad range of musical offerings but we also have the ability to give our kids direct contact with incredibly talented artists like brad delson
1241550 the dim brilliance of the fragment criticizes the sharpness of the form
1241551 so youre the guy that ive talked to a couple times

1241554 three innocent people have suffered enormously and it seems to me a sentence involving home detention is simply inadequate to cover what you have done
1241555 but by no means sees that as the end of his obligations
1241556 clearly indicative of your attitude to driving at the time although it isnt now
1241557 you showed your willingness to flout the rules and run risks
1241558 grossly excessive speed and the showing off that is exactly what you were doing
1241559 you were simply another in a long line of people who appear before this court on this kind of case
1241560 despite all the advertising we see somehow the message doesnt seem to be getting through that bad driving and alcohol results in injury and death
1241561 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1241562 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1241563 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1241564 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1241565 if only every jury in this country reacted to racism or bigotry the way this jury did we would have a much better jury system
1241566 stubborn rude stingy are thieves and have stolen other persons ideas
1241567 the author also claims that the bush administration had information from a top iraqi intelligence official
1241568 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1241569 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1241570 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1241571 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1241572 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1241573 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1241574 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1241575 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1241576 you also need help from the rest of the side

1241578 theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1241579 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1241580 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist

1241595 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1241596 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1241597 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1241598 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1241599 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1241600 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1241601 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1241602 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1241603 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1241604 a huge dump of worn out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves
1241605 meritorious or as unjustly closed out from the ranks of the meritorious
1241606 these vulnerable constituencies did not need too much political coaxing to bite the hand that had slapped them in the face
1241607 we need to rebuild our positions in cuba and other countries
1241608 you either need to come up with a better story or find a girlfriend who wont leave your dumbass stranded in the city every single day
1241609 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1241610 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1241611 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1241612 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1241613 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1241614 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1241615 conservatives still think highly of him and are enthusiastic supporters whenever he speaks
1241616 for a campaign that has largely failed in reaching out to conservatives reaching out to cheney wouldnt be a bad idea
1241617 screw the lot of yas while i take my retirement in dubai
1241618 it is deeply satisfying to believe that we are not locked into our original statements that we might start and stop erase use the delete key in life and be saved from the roughness of our earlier drafts

1241623 with the tro there will be no signing and when there is no signing there is no need to postpone the elections
1241624 the premise of the government in pushing for the postponement of elections is no longer there aside from the fact that it is too late
1241625 right now that is how confident we are that we are ready for the elections
1241626 it is all systems go come hell or high water

1241628 presently the qcpd continues to monitor study and draw assessment from previously identified carnapping activities and possible root causes as references to current developments
1241629 some carnapping suspects who were arrested by qcpd in the past have posted bail and are back in the nefarious business of carnapping under concealed identities and or merely forming another syndicated carnapping group
1241630 i started using drugs at the age of 16 my drug of choice really was alcohol then it progressed more into marijuana and then eventually i started using other serious drugs like crack cocaine hallucinogenics
1241631 i began my criminal career at the age of 17 unfortunately it ranged from theft to residential burglaries to substantial battery with a weapon to a marijuana charge then the creme de la creme as i would call it of all my crimes possession with the intent to deliver and battery to an inmate
1241632 i was really deep into it because i felt that was the only family that i had i felt a since of belonging you know being a part of that
1241633 the cgip program has enabled me to really tunnel down in the recesses of my mind to really dig deep within myself to realize that i did things by impulse instead of really stopping to think about okay if i do this what would happen
1241634 i recently just did julius caesar i played the character of marc antony oh mighty caesar thus thou lie so low are all thy conquest glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well
1241635 im going to give you guys the opportunity to kind of come up with some of your own beliefs
1241636 were teaching the men to intervene in their self talk and in particular with this population intervening in the self talk that led to them coming here
1241637 where not telling them what to think were saying take a look at how youre thinking versus you must change they have the choice
1241638 do you think this time when you get out itll be different
1241639 maybe if i change my old beliefs things will be different instead of using those same beliefs to justify me committing crimes maybe i can change those and be more patient and maybe things will work out
1241640 dnr forestry staff field staff went to a private property to assess trees that were of concern biological samples of the insect was taken an adult and larvae and pupae were taken and then submitted through the appropriate channels through the department of agriculture and then finally to the smithsonian and ultimately late friday afternoon on the 1st we received confirmation that this was indeed emerald ash borer
1241641 it bores into the bark lays eggs and subsequently the larvae are what feed on the inside of the bark in the growing tissue the movement of water is stopped basically or moisture within the tree and ultimately the tree has no ability to have needed moisture for growing
1241642 firewood in particular is a significant area of concern that is the primary means that emerald ash borer spreads by so firewood is the real valve were trying to cut off in spreading this critter nurseries have been paying attention to emerald ash borer coming along to the point and know that the future of ash is something they need to be thinking about as theyre working with their nursery stock communities that are moving brush from one community to a brush location they take it to that kind of stuff ash materials just cannot be moved out of that quarantine area
1241643 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1241644 it is at least possible though its not certain that itll affect their vote
1241645 to develop innovative products industry relies on the same experts
1241646 well we have to add this to my 37 cents
1241647 its sexual attraction almost everything thats why we hire good looking people in our stores because good looking people attract other good looking people and we want to market to cool good looking people we dont market to anyone other than that
1241648 an explanation of the topic or purpose of a research paper
1241649 that this holy objective the reconciliation of all christians in the unity of the one and only church of christ transcends human powers and gifts

1241651 jesus heal all divisions and bring all believers together we long for the day when gods people are gathered around your table in complete unity and love
1241652 genuine ecumenism is not about convincing non catholics to become catholic or pretending that were not catholic rather it is a quest for mutual respect and understanding a quest for members of different traditions and denominations to honor everything that unites them even as they discuss respectfully the things that divide them
1241653 before philip called you when you were under the fig tree i saw you

1241661 we in our country share this hope for a new age of religious freedom in the soviet union we share the hope that this monastery is a symbol of a new policy of religious tolerance that will extend to all peoples of all faiths
1241662 when we introduced the one minute monk to catholic radio in late may we were unsure of the response
1241663 nearly 70 of catholic radio stations have already agreed to air the show with more telling us they will likely work it into their fall rotation we just recorded the second dozen episodes covering everything from prayer to anger to joy and so much more i myself didnt realize how a short booklet written to order monastic life in the 6 th century could apply to our modern life outside a religious community
1241664 when i moved down here two years ago to join the college
1241665 i lived for two months as a guest in the monastery i was given a copy of the rule and observed firsthand how the monks lived according to it in discussions with them i began to realize how it is a guide to daily growth in holiness that can aid us all whether within monastery walls or without a benedictine monastery is a family and the rule is truly a guide to family life well god puts us all into families of one kind or another so it actually makes a lot of sense to introduce the modern stressed out maxed out on the go catholic to the wisdom of 1500 years ago whats more when our holy father chooses benedict as his name it suggests that he thinks the original benedict had something important to say to us today
1241666 its been the hard word of the people who stepped up energetically to execute it which has made this a success story and not just another interesting idea
1241667 the challenge is to retain that richness that elegance that permeated the written english of educated men a hundred or even fifty years ago
1241668 temper ing the archaic tone that turns away too many readers
1241669 the strong to have something to strive for and the weak nothing to run from
1241670 said the priest speaking at trinity united church of christ in chicago
1241671 youre supposed to be a messenger youre supposed to be the person who brings people the good news
1241672 but instead of being the mediator you can end up putting the focus on yourself you can become the message and before you know it people can start basing their faith on you instead of god
1241673 crazy persons but they do have problems of their own
1241674 they are the problems of the preacher i know there are few moments to compare with the affection and approval of parishioners after mass especially if you have been helpful in strengthening their faith but the most distressing moment for me was the one homily i gave that evoked applause of course it was gratifying but it was disturbing what was the applause for
1241675 whether you are preaching to liberals or conservatives its hard to tell people truths that they dont want to hear
1241676 its hard to tell people to love their enemies its hard to tell people to repent of their sins and to forgive others if your people are smiling and applauding all of the time all of the time thats when warning flags need to go up
1241677 there were finger paints outside remember the time we let them paint with their feet on the deck and then slide into the baby pool and make the water all colored remember how my house always smelled of fresh baked bread and murphys oil soap
1241678 that you wore the finish off the floor because you were addicted to that smell
1241679 you have eight times the children and youre going in a million different directions trying to meet the needs of absolutely every stage of child development
1241680 i dont think its possible to live a recollected life and be plugged in
1241681 everything is black or white plugged in or unplugged no middle ground
1241682 heres the problem youre hearing with your young mom correspondent and youre seeing in yourself you reach a point in your day when you want a bit of time alone
1241683 but now you think youre spending time alone but youre really connecting with all these different people in all these different places youre getting tons of input and sensory stimulation and then you think youre nurturing relationships but really its very rare that a true friendship uses a keyboard as a medium i just dont think people are created that way in the end the place you go when youre feeling depleted the place you look for shoring up ends up sucking the last little bit of energy from you
1241684 i just want to bake bread and wash the floor
1241685 you are allergic to wheat and christian washes the floor now
1241686 were very strict were probably the strictest among the web sites we dont encourage racy bikini content on our web site

1241692 as part of our 401 k retirement assets we are receiving monthly income from a ginnie mae fund although there has been a great deal of press as to the vulnerability of freddie and fannie i have not seen a mention of ginnie perhaps some of your readers would appreciate a better understanding of the differences
1241693 the bank collects mortgage payments from borrowers and passes payments to ginnie mae which passes them through to investors
1241694 if the bank cant make all or part of the pass through payment ginnie mae makes sure that bondholders continue to get their promised payments
1241695 you dont have to worry about credit risk with ginnie maes
1241696 they are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government just like a treasury bond thats not the case with fannie and freddie although recent steps suggest that if they dont have the full faith and credit theyre pretty close
1241697 i ask myself did they connect with this piece does it resonate what i should do with this paragraph or that paragraph isnt an issue to me
1241698 identity who we are where we come from what we are is difficult to maintain in exile

1241700 an interesting story that someone told me once is that in belfast by what street someone lives on you can tell not only their religion but tell how much money theyre making literally by which side of the road they live on because the further up the hill the more expensive the houses become you can almost tell what the people are earning by the name of the street they live on and what side ot that street they live on that said something to me and so i started writing about a place where the streets have no name
1241701 yeah lets start at 2 p m so thatll give you

1241706 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily non religious messages of military service death and sacrifice
1241707 this is a wonderful victory not only for the families of majors martino and bloomfield who can have some comfort knowing that the memories of their loved ones are preserved under the cross but for all americans who care about our young men and women who have sacrificed their lives in defense of our country sadly i fully expect the aclu attorneys to appeal this decision to the ninth circuit court of appeals so this fight is not over
1241708 mount soledad becomes a place to reflect on our past be inspired by true patriots and offer war veterans our heartfelt gratitude for the freedom we all enjoy today

1241756 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1241757 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1241758 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1241759 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday

1241782 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1241783 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data

1241788 the dollar rupee has strong support at 42 35 however the stocks are going to be key if markets go up then we may see it break this level and go to 42 20 25 and if they are negative then the rupee may depreciate to about 42 43 42 45

1241791 i know i got a a bunch of messages and comments
1241792 ladies free before 12 and dj scratch n sniff is on the 1s and 2s i read about it the 1st three times
1241793 although countrywide had technology in place to disable flash drives on employee computers rebollo was able to circumvent the safeguard by making use of a pc that didnt have it installed
1241794 ma che cacchio sto facendo lascio la mia famiglia i miei amici e tutto questo per cosa per un tuffo nel buio
1241795 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
1241796 a favorite son candidate is not the same thing as a real candidate if you enter the primary as a favorite son the major candidates wont enter the race so well avoid a disastrous primary fight as governor youll win the primary but that only means youll head the delegation to the convention
1241797 ill do that ill enter my name as a favorite son but thats all and only on one condition that our delegation be representative of all sides in this split not just one group
1241798 women more so than men use kissing as an assessment device
1241799 men however would forgo kissing as long as they can have sex
1241800 the first kiss is a deal breaker in terms of determining how the relationship will play out a woman feels a kiss can predict how good of a lover a guy will be a bad kiss will deter her from getting involved with him
1241801 if a man is conscientious and intuitive enough to kiss me in a way that makes me feel special and cared about then that tells me hes the kind of man id like to be in a relationship with
1241802 kissing requires good breath and moist non crusty or chapped lips
1241803 these things show a guy takes care of himself a crucial sign he can care for others good breath and moist lips may also indicate that he was considerate enough to freshen up after the garlic bread appetizer
1241804 the white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqs former intel director habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1241805 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1241806 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1241807 its always nice when wilson comes in and has a good clean inning
1241808 ive been part of some of his losses and ive seen some
1241809 its been heartbreaking you probably could flip eight or nine of those into wins
1241810 well see i havent been going at it as well as id like lately ive had some great at bats and hit the ball well and ill think all right its a step in the right direction then my next four at bats will be terrible its a day to day thing time will tell
1241811 we invited all the outfielders who played a certain number of games he definitely was invited we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of this organization
1241812 were still getting response we dont have a final list
1241813 we dont know if hes going to come or not we always send letters and make follow up phone calls he was treated like everyone else
1241814 thats what well decide if we need to give him a break skip a start or shut him down
1241815 if we need to do that we will just like we did with timmy lincecum during the season a guy has two or three starts when he doesnt have his best stuff usually you work your way out of it were confident he will
1241816 like i always said if things are important to you you will fight about it
1241817 we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work
1241818 it was intense but it wasnt like we were trying to kill guys
1241819 i let a guy knock the ball out of my hands
1241820 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do
1241821 if i was hurt id be in the training room somewhere or be out working with the trainers but i feel fine i feel good
1241822 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out there like everybody else
1241823 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1241824 its just like racing horses you cant run them every day and expect them go out there on race day and perform at their best
1241825 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats what im going through right now
1241826 it projects still lack alignment with business objectives at many organisations and as a result they are unable to realise business benefits
1241827 the survey shows that 81 percent of the 1 600 respondents who named information security management as a number 3 concern said that security risks are not fully known or are only partially assessed using technology
1241828 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1241829 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1241830 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1241831 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1241832 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1241833 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1241834 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1241835 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1241836 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him
1241837 so how is yous sinuses been since i sawed you
1241838 i believe that medical services are quick to hand out antidepressants to members of the military community because they assume we are all teetering on the edge of losing our minds from grief sadness or stress without really addressing the real needs of the patients sitting right in front of them
1241839 as an offensive lineman you understand that youre going to play injured but you want to go into a season fresh
1241840 starting off with some pretty serious injuries makes me nervous im confident but im nervous
1241841 ill be able to start against michigan state on aug 30
1241842 i dont know if ill be at 100 but ill definitely be able to push 245 pound defensive ends off me
1241843 nyan seems to be hungrier and seems to have fit in really well
1241844 i think he came here with the idea that he was from florida and he was something different than these guys but hes found his place and has been accepted he can just focus on what he needs to do instead of putting on any show to prove what hes about
1241845 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process
1241846 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1241847 i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other
1241848 ive just got to go out and do my part if it happens it happens if it dont it dont
1241849 theres just so many different things and you hear something new every day
1241850 i still know a lot of people over there so i follow them its the craziest situation youve ever seen
1241851 but ive never met a parent who is perfect 100 percent of the time we all can improve our batting average
1241852 i was reading probably for the 10th time harvey penicks little red golf book
1241853 it is built around a series of very short essays that cover very basic principles
1241854 as i was reading it i was thinking that this might be a good way to teach people how to be better parents
1241855 tell yourself that every day how you treat and respond to your child should come from a knowledgeable deliberate sense of what you want to accomplish always ask yourself what effect will my decision have on my child
1241856 when it comes to genuine expressions of warmth and affection you cannot love your child too much it is simply not possible to spoil a child with love what we often think of as the product of spoiling a child is never the result of showing a child too much love it is usually the consequence of giving a child things in place of love things like leniency lowered expectations or material possessions
1241857 being an involved parent takes time and is hard work and it often means rethinking and rearranging your priorities it frequently means sacrificing what you want to do for what your child needs you to do be there mentally as well as physically
1241858 make sure your parenting keeps pace with your childs development you may wish you could slow down or freeze frame your childs life but this is the last thing he wants you may be fighting getting older but all he wants is to grow up the same drive for independence that is making your three year old say no all the time is whats motivating him to be toilet trained the same intellectual growth spurt that is making your 13 year old curious and inquisitive in the classroom also is making her argumentative at the dinner table
1241859 if you dont manage your childs behavior when he is young he will have a hard time learning how to manage himself when he is older and you arent around any time of the day or night you should always be able to answer these three questions where is my child who is with my child what is my child doing the rules your child has learned from you are going to shape the rules he applies to himself
1241860 setting limits helps your child develop a sense of self control encouraging independence helps her develop a sense of self direction to be successful in life shes going to need both accepting that it is normal for children to push for autonomy is absolutely key to effective parenting many parents mistakenly equate their childs independence with rebelliousness or disobedience children push for independence because it is part of human nature to want to feel in control rather than to feel controlled by someone else
1241861 if your rules vary from day to day in an unpredictable fashion or if you enforce them only intermittently your childs misbehavior is your fault not his your most important disciplinary tool is consistency identify your non negotiables the more your authority is based on wisdom and not on power the less your child will challenge it
1241862 of all the forms of punishment that parents use the one with the worst side effects is physical punishment children who are spanked hit or slapped are more prone to fighting with other children they are more likely to be bullies and more likely to use aggression to solve disputes with others
1241863 good parents have expectations they want their child to live up to generally parents overexplain to young children and underexplain to adolescents what is obvious to you may not be evident to a 12 year old he doesnt have the priorities judgment or experience that you have
1241864 the best way to get respectful treatment from your child is to treat him respectfully you should give your child the same courtesies you would give to anyone else speak to him politely respect his opinion pay attention when he is speaking to you treat him kindly try to please him when you can children treat others the way their parents treat them your relationship with your child is the foundation for her relationships with others
1241865 raising children is not something we think of as especially scientific
1241866 but parenting is one of the most well researched areas in the entire field of social science it has been studied for 75 years and the findings have remained remarkably consistent over time
1241867 the advice in the book is based on what scientists who study parenting have learned from decades of systematic research involving hundreds of thousands of families what ive done is to synthesize and communicate what the experts have learned in a language that non experts can understand
1241868 parenting that fosters psychological adjustment elements like honesty empathy self reliance kindness cooperation self control and cheerfulness
1241869 good parenting is parenting that helps children succeed in school
1241870 it promotes the development of intellectual curiosity motivation to learn and desire to achieve it deters children from anti social behavior delinquency and drug and alcohol use and good parenting is parenting that helps protect children against the development of anxiety depression eating disorders and other types of psychological distress

1241878 le foto del murales che ritrae il volto del boss latitante matteo messina denaro dipinto sul muro di cinta dietro la cattedrale di palermo sono apparse su un blog il 23 gennaio scorso inserite da uno studente universitario di 27 anni walter giann

1241883 in any situation affecting the public valero prides itself on working closely with the community to make sure residents are informed and aware of what is happening at the plant
1241884 its just a personal situation ive got some personal things going on in dallas that need attending to
1241885 i think he felt that he had never worked at a place where it was so hard to get things done
1241886 he had to work a whole year to get three vet techs hired
1241887 barc has made improvements and hiring kent was one of those improvements
1241888 weve come pretty close to turning around the culture how the bureau operates
1241889 kent was good about working with volunteers and increasing adoptions he had the right agenda he just didnt have the resources
1241890 were sorry to see him go we thought he was making some great progress
1241891 ill be honest with you that could be very crucial on a decision of whether that district is still an independent school district in the 09 10 school year
1241892 were asking the board to give the community the opportunity to choose what they want to do with their schools
1241893 i dont see how they could exist the agency cannot continue to work with them if they are not going to make an effort to pay back the debt
1241894 they should find some other way to get the money this community is all basically single parents and elderly on fixed incomes i dont agree with that at all
1241895 a lot of people are just disappointed with the school district and a lot of folks are saying they are not in support of a tax increase
1241896 to penalize us the community i dont think its fair but by the same token the deficit is what it is
1241897 if they dont pay the tax dollars here theyre going to pay them anyway
1241898 we could be in a world of trouble in five years when this plays out
1241899 unfortunately poor minority and low achieving students are far more likely to be taught by an under qualified teacher than their more affluent white and high achieving peers
1241900 the students most in need of the most qualified teachers are the least likely to be taught by them
1241901 otherwise we will continue to have the inequity its not going to go away
1241902 its been shown that the most important factor in closing the achievement gaps is the work of an effective teacher we need to get as many as we can in the right places
1241903 how to make your teachers quit they would look at what the state of texas does
1241904 we place brand new teachers in very hard to teach schools we dont have strong mentoring programs and they get very frustrated
1241905 where they have a fighting chance that at least three quarters of the student body will pass the test
1241906 you have a great fear when that happens thats why its good to have the training because the training takes over
1241907 basically when someones having a seizure theres not much you can do for them except keep them from injuring themselves but then the situation deteriorated and he stopped breathing and didnt have any pulse
1241908 obviously we were very concerned there for a few minutes but if this had to happen to this young man it was probably good that it happened right there with a lot of trained people
1241909 we have a six week conditioning camp during the summer that he attended
1241910 he shouldve been in very good shape so it was just a complete shock to us and i dont think it had anything to do with heat or anything like that this was something else
1241911 the first thing the emt said to me when i got to the emergency room was your staff performed heroically
1241912 dallasblog has learned that texas railroad commissioner elizabeth ames jones definitely will run for the u s senate seat being vacated by sen kay bailey hutchison in 2010 or earlier
1241913 we dont know what senator hutchison is going to do

1241951 like i said i dont really know i just met him and he seemed cool and hes watching my stuff until i get back hes working inside some sort of high security office carries a gun but hes like a guard i guess apparently he sits behind bullet proof glass all day and reads the paper maybe its a check cashing place or something i didnt see any sign though i dont know he could probably stand to get high seems like a boring job
1241952 yeah i guess its weird but some might say drinking a beer at what
1241953 if you wake up at seven or eight the night before
1241954 youre totally right there except i didnt wake up until about three and a half hours ago and you guys were still asleep when i left
1241955 i guess the point is that its all relative to something else so there really is no right or wrong time to drink a beer relatively
1241956 i hate to see you go jim well when do you think you might be back around
1241957 in the bottom drawer jim here thinks its weird to drink this early though
1241958 no i didnt say that i said it was relatively weird
1241959 i would have to say its pretty fucking straight in relation to fisting a donkey but thats not what i meant i meant its only weird relative say when the person who is drinking it woke up so the act itself isnt inherently weird at all
1241960 you meant you wish your relatives all drank so you wouldnt feel so weird some times
1241961 i dont feel weird around my relatives and most of them dont drink so subjectively of course its pretty weird for me to drink at times in relation to when they sleep
1241962 eventually ill see my folks yeah i sort of have to do that every once in a while
1241963 i wish i could hang out more really but the rest of my stuff is with that guy and its already been like almost five hours since i left
1241964 you dont think hed go through your shit do you
1241965 nah theres nothing of interest in there anyway just rocks and socks ha
1241966 hey we need to go get groceries anyway why dont we drive you
1241967 you sure this guy is cool hes not going to rob you or something is he
1241968 thats ok im wearing my bulletproof jacket also im a ninja
1241969 oh so youre just going to give me six hundred dollars
1241970 no no thanks hey it was nice meeting all of you im out of here
1241971 how could this steal all these feelings how could they lie to the world a picture away from your smile one heart replaced feelings displaced invade our space
1241972 what the song shows is that paul just feels sorry for her he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life
1241973 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life
1241974 we did some rehearsals but then i found out it was six days a week for a couple of months
1241975 i was flattered but with my schedule there was no way i could fit it in
1241976 i really wanna have a sit down dinner with madonna im waiting for that invitation i wanna ask her how shes made it through all of this and still continues
1241977 if she would just give me a little advice i really wanna pick her brain
1241978 we cant confirm who weve been talking to about the estate
1241979 there has been a lot of interest but we cannot disclose the names of any potential purchaser
1241980 it the esc would remind bbc management of the need to ensure that every effort is made to make certain that facts are thoroughly checked so as not to mislead the audience and to meet the bbcs obligation on impartiality
1241981 im actually more terrified when he takes me on a drive especially through the canyons in l a wow hes at one with his car lets just say that
1241982 donny has a huge fanbase and everyone loves him he has the potential to win
1241983 tiene que ver con el orgullo nacional se convierte en la primera medalla dorada de los juegos
1241984 en cada olimp ada existe esa sensaci n de que estamos presentando el pa s al mundo y eso en realidad probablemente sea as desde 1980 cuando este evento se convirti en un gran negocio televisivo
1241985 todo tipo de demostraci n o propaganda pol tica religiosa o racial en cualquier sitio instalaci n u otras reas vinculadas con los juegos ol mpicos
1241986 el prop sito de organizar este evento es demostrarle al pueblo chino que el resto del mundo reconoce al partido comunista como un l der leg timo
1241987 es por eso que si aparecen algunos mandatarios como el presidente
1241988 read the best books first or you may not have a chance to read them all
1241989 while remaining conscious its as if your bodys faintin but youre not
1241990 its hard for me to understand sen mccains argument he was telling me i was supposed to take this trip he suggested it thought it was a good idea
1241991 john mccain has visited every one of these countries post primary that i have he has given speeches in canada in colombia mexico
1241992 so it doesnt strike me that weve done anything different than the mccain campaign has done which is to recognize that part of the job of the next president and commander in chief is to forge effective relationships with our allies
1241993 el veh culo se sali de la carretera y dio varias vueltas
1241994 fact is every presidential candidate since george h w bush has promised to be the education president and each has expanded the federal governments role in public schools how would barack obama or john mccain distinguish themselves as education presidents
1241995 both bushes at least were interested in the topic mccain is not obama is if education policy is your big issue at the polls in november its important to know that only one candidate is actually paying attention
1241996 quis combinar os sons da m sica tradicional chinesa com instrumentos modernos
1241997 okay nice for a short story but not enough for a novel
1241998 i really appreciate the work the medical guys have done and i cant wait to get back into it
1241999 its been difficult at times working my way back from the operation but everyone has been helping me
1242000 its a huge game for us as a club taking on the broncos it always is when you play them and im really looking forward to being out there with the boys again
1242001 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
1242002 i think its more what he hasnt said than what he has said
1242003 each candidate gives their obligatory two speeches on foreign policy in this campaign ive lost count
1242004 i dont think obama has got a chapter if you would in his book that addresses what needs to be done in afghanistan
1242005 to the extent people are paying attention its the middle east and oil prices
1242006 the trip was not designed to be his only opportunity to discuss national security
1242007 he has a policy toward the future that is designed to undo mistakes of the past because we shouldnt have gone into iraq we shouldnt be there now because we didnt do enough for afghanistan then we should do more now
1242008 how to more effectively deal with the front in the war on terrorism the threat from al qaeda and the taliban originating from the pakistan tribal areas

1242024 i would love to see all open source innovation happen on top of windows
1242025 it was all pretty dramatic the girls were due up on stage in three minutes time when he ran up to them hed clearly had too much to drink
1242026 somehow he had got backstage within yards of the group luckily their security team intercepted him before he was able to do anything untoward but it took three burly guys to bring him down as he was getting really aggressive once they were safely onstage the decision was made to call the police
1242027 to add another animal to his herd and another and another but this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons therein is the tragedy
1242028 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1242029 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1242030 the way i play is by gut instinct i like to do things spontaneously i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game although you have to be accountable for the things you do and be responsible for the decisions you make
1242031 i dont think i would be sitting here today if i wasnt 100 per cent confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine peter likes to challenge players but the crux of the meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1242032 we have said we want to be parents one day but lara is 21 and i am 27 we have a lot in front of us and i think that stuff will come all in good time
1242033 we honestly havent set a date for the wedding because the next 12 months cricket wise is ridiculous

1242035 the magician and his apprentice are believers in the deep and narrow art of closeup card magic a few nights earlier they had gone with a dozen or so other people on a rare late night tour of the illusionist david copperfields warehouse which contains the worlds greatest collection of magic paraphernalia
1242036 a woman caused uproar in court when she pulled two fingers from her handbag claiming they had belonged to one of her six children remi fakorede who was convicted of a 925 000 tax credit fraud told londons snaresbrook crown court they had fallen off following a curse she said the same voodoo curse had caused her to participate in the fraud the 46 year old from hackney was convicted of fraud committed between 1 august 2002 and 26 june 2007 although it is understood one of her children had lost part of her hand after suffering renal problems and developing gangrene dna test results are now awaited to determine who the body parts belonged to
1242037 because it would make it a lot easier on me if it were
1242038 its the best job in the ioc because you have the honour to represent the voice of the athlete
1242039 we still dont even know what suit hell be wearing
1242040 nike is his sponsor theyve given him a generic speedo suit but they dont quite fit
1242041 the camps protected by the army a lot of sporting teams are there its good it has got everything
1242042 it was quite sickening to watch my wife almost threw up and had to lie down afterward
1242043 its in the reports you can read about it in the media reports
1242044 the dispute over the ownership of the wahaha brand which lasted more than one year was finally settled and it was affirmed that wahaha brand belongs to wahaha
1242045 danone will continue to pursue all legal options to protect its contractual rights and financial interests
1242046 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
1242047 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
1242048 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction
1242049 thats why this wasnt easy but well put this to our advantage
1242050 although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return general manager ted thompson and coach mike mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place
1242051 its not rainers fault he played very well at wimbledon
1242052 he did play the semis even if it was after the olympic deadline
1242053 i guess the olympic committee thought he had better chances than me ive not spoken to rainer but there is no point to complain
1242054 ive been training for two weeks the hard court season is very important for me i cannot call the atp or itf every two days asking about the situation
1242055 i will be happy to play davis cup for germany
1242056 its not the fault of the german tennis federation but the olympic committee
1242057 i have episode one of season three here were going to watch it right now
1242058 will it completely stop them from coming across of course not
1242059 rest assured there will eventually be holes in parts of the wall made by people trying to get in but it buys us valuable time
1242060 the great wall of china did not stop the mongols and the berlin wall didnt stop people escaping to freedom why do they think this will be any different
1242061 is a political initiative meant to satisfy conservatives in congress who have played to fears about all immigrants being terrorists criminals and living off the dole
1242062 we have no idea to what extent we can enforce our own laws
1242063 the consequences of an open border are smuggling of drugs and human beings into this country
1242064 intensified and mixed anti immigrant racist views with a law enforcement only approach towards immigration
1242065 the main immigration flow has not stopped coming it just shifted
1242066 in other words the same number or more people are crossing the border
1242067 the wall is symptomatic of the fact that the us is not responsive to a rational immigration policy
1242068 yes ill eat my food and your food and your food and whatever else you leave out on the counter
1242069 its either a massive stroke or a brain tumor and given her age her breed your account and her symptoms i think its a brain tumor if you want you can do a ct scan to confirm but theres nothing we can do about her health if you want to take her home and keep her there i can prescribe some stronger pain meds but she will be incontinent and bed ridden and i cannot guarantee how long she will live or you can euthanize her
1242070 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1242071 breaking our oil addiction will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1242072 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1242073 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long
1242074 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1242075 says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1242076 had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them

1242079 questa tv ha spiegato veltroni non vuole essere un canale televisivo in pi ma una struttura aperta come vuole essere il pd che parte dallesperienza di web 2 0 cio democratica tv e punta a coinvolgere i contributi di cittadini e utenti perch il nostro riferimento il linguaggio dentro la rete e non la vecchia tv
1242080 al quale ha assicurato il capo dei democratici dovremo presentarci accelerando quel profilo di innovazione del partito ai primi mesi della sua nascita
1242081 il problema si sfoga veltroni che voi prima di noi siete inchiodati a questa idea dei duellanti questa la tv del partito e non dei veltroniani anche perch se ci fossero i veltroniani io non ci apparterrei e non capisco perch se italianieuropei o altri fanno iniziative del genere dovremmo impedire che accada

1242098 we have seen coverage from the security community of a worm on popular social networking sites that is using social engineering lures to get users to install a piece of malware according to the reports the worm posts comments on these sites that include links to a fake site if the link is followed users are told they need to update their flash player the installer posted on a malicious site of course installs malware instead of flash player wed like to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of validating installers and updates before installing them first off do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com you can find the link for downloading flash player here this goes for any piece of software reader windows media player quicktime etc if you get a notice to update its not a bad idea to go directly to the site of the software vendor and download the update directly from the source if the download is from an unfamiliar url or an ip address you should be suspicious
1242099 i want to see whats going on the whole scenario how they got to this point
1242100 i just want to make sure they have enough stuff on this guy it sounds pretty solid but i want to see them face to face to see whats going on i just need some closure
1242101 i have no questions for them i expect no real answers from them
1242102 im not going to ask any question im just going to listen and glean the facts
1242103 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs
1242104 it is just because it is so close to the olympics
1242105 but dont worry this doesnt affect ordinary people like you and me
1242106 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1242107 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1242108 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1242109 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs
1242110 the general mood is fear official intimidation a police state fear
1242111 win a comprehensive victory in the security battle for the olympics and to protect the harmony and stability of tibetan society

1242119 maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible over southeastern texas
1242120 he doesnt get a lot of headlines but he is one of the key players at qualcomm
1242121 hes a great operations guy and qualcomm is a great training ground
1242122 but im surprised they did not pick someone with more imagination in devices im not sure whether a semiconductor guy does the trick can he green light the next five great devices consumers want
1242123 but i would not have taken this job if i did not believe in the organization
1242124 he sees things for what they are and changes things that need to be changed
1242125 i am optimistic that we will be good partners so collectively we make better decisions
1242126 at this point it appears he will not be our candidate
1242127 there are other factors involved here its more for the third party and independent movement in general
1242128 while that is not directly related to the lp we have some concerns in that regard
1242129 he was here when i first joined the club in the winter of 77 he helped me a lot conversations helping me find my way around the city he was a good friend of everybodys

1242246 you have a large number of employers and a transient workforce and multiple job sites and a project by project dynamic so the jobs are here today and then theyre done and an industry that is fiercely competitive
1242247 theres no question that during peak demand you find more favorable circumstances for organizing as the industry slows down workers have less leverage and feel more insecure and are more difficult to organize

1242368 theres not much out here in california i had been training in new england before this year and there were races every weekend out here weve only gone to two races so i think boston and philadelphia are definitley the hot spots for rowing
1242369 well i think a lot of it is the opportunity to get into it at a young age
1242370 its high school college and for all i know even elementary school and above you have the charles river and many people are exposed to it they think its really cool the more people that try it they want to do it and succeed
1242371 the secret is new england has a very strong rowing backgound
1242372 the ivy league is very strong theres a lot of rowing clubs popping up you have the charles river right there i just enjoy the scenery when youre on the race course its not inside a gym you embrace everything it defintely is growing more so on the womens side
1242373 i think that a lot of it has to do with the tradition of rowing in the new england area and specifically on the charles river
1242374 for me the charles river was amazing because not only was the rowing top notch but also i like how the river is a fabric of the boston culture and overall fabric of the city its definitely a city where its fun to be a rower on the river you can see the boston museum of science the

1242385 ultimately were realizing the impact this has had on our community knowing that weve got a lot of issues out there perceptions of the police department and how it works and were challenged to work on that
1242386 the message i got out of all this is that its ok for police to go and kill in a drug raid
1242387 we tried to explain why joe used deadly force that night
1242388 its another example that theres very low value on black lives in this community

1242408 uneducated in the fundamentals of a given art or branch of learning lacking knowledge of a specific field
1242409 the students have mostly positive feelings about having their writing on the wiki and although some have concerns for who is reading the writing they see the benefits from improving overshadow their anxiety
1242410 sometimes its hard to take criticism but being able to be anonymous on the web logs helps students to write what is really on their mind its gives them a freedom that doesnt always exist in the classroom
1242411 many of the freshman students and my junior peers for that matter are shy about critiquing the work of others and are embarrassed to allow others to see their own work by blogging anonymously it allows everyone to get their writing reviewed and analyzed
1242412 i miss the old days when i could write up a paper in my notebook and hand it in its more personal more concrete and permanent and it eliminated a lot of this confusion and frustration i am feeling in this class
1242413 however in an intensive writing class like this i think that maybe we should focus a little more on the actual act of writing rather than spending entire class periods learning how to get around the umasswiki website
1242414 the anonymity of the feedback provides constructive criticism which we can obviously benefit from but it is not reflective of the real world
1242415 bukankah tata tertib dibuat sendiri oleh dpr tapi mengapa diperdebatkan
1242416 dpr selalu memperdebatkan hal hal yang bersifat prosedural dan tidak memperhatikan substansi padahal masih banyak masalah yang harus ditangani dpr

1242433 i have also heard from some in the corporate world that they know that patent searches done in india are crap but they are so cheap that if they get a bad search they just pay to get another search done from scratch obviously this is alarming if what you are trying to do is actually find prior art how can you know simply by looking at search results if everything meaningful has been found certainly we can identify crap when we see it but can quality be identified and results really ever relied upon

1242461 fast when you see the crescent if it is obscured to you then complete thirty days of shabaan and break your fast when you see the crescent if it is obscured to you then fast thirty days
1242462 if two just muslims testify that they saw it then fast or break your fast
1242463 people were looking for the crescent of ramadaan i informed the prophet that i saw it so he fasted on the following day and ordered the people to fast
1242464 thus ibn umar used to end his fasting with the rest of the people without relying on these computations
1242465 beware of exaggeration in religion indeed those before you were destroyed because of their exaggeration in religion
1242466 many people think that once the new moon rises in the skies regardless of whether the people see it or not that night would be the first of the month
1242467 we went to the minor pilgrimage and saw the crescent of ramadaan at dhaatu irq
1242468 allaah has set crescent sighting as an indication of ramadaan thus ramadaan starts on the night that you see it if it is obscured then complete the count
1242469 true fasting starts on the day that you start fasting true fitr that is eed is on the day that you end your fasting true adhaa that is eed is on the day that you offer your sacrifice

1242471 basketball is chinas biggest sport and the nike zhanqilai secret stage tournament is both a celebration of the olympics and an experiential marketing campaign designed to inspire chinas youth
1242472 having four of the worlds biggest basketball stars at the culmination of this campaign is an incredible coup its a sign of solidarity and will galvanise a generation around their favourite sport zhanqilai should make chinese youth feel they can take on the world
1242473 creating zhanqilai is the culmination of months of organisation and guanxi dmg leveraged its significant government relationships to gain permission to run such a high profile event during chinas most sensitive time in its modern history
1242474 outsourcing has be going on in the open in the patent area for at least 5 or 6 years without anyone raising any issues for a long time i have thought that all of this violated the ear but no one seemed to agree with me i personally think strict interpretation of the ear is going to prevent the exporting of not only the preparation of patent applications but also the outsourcing of patent illustrations and patent searches this is because the ear specifically prevents the sending abroad of any information relating to technology that has been developed in the us the way i read the ear there is no patent application exception that would save outsourcing there is a patent application exception but it relates to the sending of information from the us outside the us for purposes of obtaining a signature by an inventor not located in the us there are other patent application exceptions but these apply to published applications if you look at the ear the primary exceptions relate to publicly available information and scientific information that is normally shared within the scientific community given that patent applications by their nature need to apply to inventions that are not known to exist previously and because the outsourcing would occur before filing i e well before the information would be publicly available and or published in almost all situations there would be a prohibition against sending information related to proprietary information overseas thus killing patent related outsourcing

1242480 this is like having a personal assistant for your memory our daily routines are overflowing with situations where we gain new information through meetings advertisements conferences events surfing the web or even window shopping instead of going home and using a general web search to find that information pensieve helps the brain recall those everyday things you might normally forget
1242481 this is where the real power of collaboration kicks in you can recall the name of the person you met right before you entered a meeting by traversing a timeline of your experiences or share a business trip with colleagues by creating a mash up that shows a map with an animation of your trail and the pictures you took in every location

1242530 when i hurt it i saw it happen in the mirror but i was in denial i didnt want to believe it was that bad i just kept training and hoping it would get better i was able to train and do cardio it just felt weird some times so i just iced it and didnt do my routine
1242531 about 6 hours after the mri the doctor called and asked me if i was sitting down he told me my acl was completely torn and he was amazed i was still able to do all the things i had been doing he told me then i would need surgery and that there was no way i would be able to do the ifbb olympia this year i was devastated this is what i love to do and its my bread and butter i cant believe i wont be competing in the ifbb olympia this year
1242532 i am alright sometime and other times not i have been competing every year since 1997 without a break i wont have competed at all in 2008 and i love to compete i am very sad about this but then i think that i am lucky because i will recover from this and i can still walk and do many things other people have it much worse than i do i just get upset sometimes when i think about it i want so badly to be able to jump up in the air and do my routine but i cant its just motivating me to train harder on other things
1242533 there was no way i would have the time or experience to promote the event on my own so i got in touch with npc texas state chairman lee thompson who offered to work with me and try our best to make the show happen
1242534 the first big problem was the venue where john had it the first two years was too small and the stage was not adequate he had reserved the convention center which was huge but there were a lot of legal issues surrounding the deposit organ had made on the venue so we had to find another place it was almost impossible to find a suitable venue and once we did it was too late for potential sponsors to come up with the dollars required to make the show a success much to our disappointment as each week passed it became more and more obvious that it was going to be impossible to promote the event this year
1242535 we all wanted to do this show in tribute to john he was very well liked by all who knew him and he always put on a great show for the competitors and fans the competitors also looked forward to that show each year being in palm beach florida as well as being right after the ifbb olympia the girls could try to qualify for the following years ifbb olympia taking all the pressure off to qualify the next year it was more than a daunting task at the outset but lee jumped in to help right away and we both did all we could to save the show this year and mr manion was supporting those efforts fully as he wanted the athletes to have that show on the schedule especially for fitness athletes who have a limited number of shows to compete in each year as it is
1242536 we may try to make it work in 2009 at least we have the time now to try and make that happen
1242537 overall i think its a balanced but tough schedule and we have a very very young team
1242538 i think we ended up with the kind of schedule we were looking for
1242539 we learned something from last year in preparing for conference with a challenging non conference schedule obviously the utep and new mexico games provide us with that in addition with usc out of the pac 10 and kansas out of the big 12 they give us two high caliber teams to use as a gage before conference play begins we also have solid road games at long beach state and north texas

1242578 sales is undergoing a sea change with customers increasingly demanding a focus on partnership understanding and the highest levels of ongoing service
1242579 the stereotype of the brash salesperson is being consigned to history replaced by those that demonstrate a collaborative customer focussed approach to selling companies need to take a look at their sales organisations to ensure that they have the right skills in their sales staff if they want to prosper the sales function should be a companys lifeblood but it needs to become as professional as the rest of 21st century business if it is to retain it importance
1242580 vendors still do not sell the way we want to buy
1242581 the superstar salespeople of the future will have dramatically different demands than today
1242582 rather than just looking for high salaries they will also want a combination of professional support and career progression to enable them to deliver on their promise and rise up in the organisation by providing the right structures companies can nurture the ceos of tomorrow within their sales teams the changing face of sales mean that todays graduates should consider sales as a key route to the top in uk organisations
1242583 we will be disappointed if there is no response to the e3 proposals by tomorrow we will have no choice but to ask the un to proceed with further sanctions

1242589 for the week i have sales data for 7 28 8 3 ed ive made about 16 000
1242590 i cant imagine that this sales rate will continue for very long

1242594 but in your hearts set apart christ as lord always be prepared to give an answer apologia to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have but do this with gentleness and respect
1242595 if there is only one way how is it that there are few in all of creation who qualify
1242596 out of the few who actually qualify why are even fewer living it out

1242611 everyone was having a good time everything worked out pretty well
1242612 we sold about 100 pounds of turtle 22 pounds of bologna and more than 150 corn dogs
1242613 what was really nice is that we had a lot more people just sitting and visiting thats what the day is all about
1242614 we had at least 100 people in the church at any given time people would come in and listen for a while and then go do something else and then another group would come in
1242615 people have really enjoyed seeing pictures of their relatives and finding some they maybe didnt know they had
1242616 we had about 24 runners which is pretty good considering there were several well established races that day too

1242625 generally everything that jack tretton laid out in the sony press conference with only two exceptions pertains exactly to the pal markets
1242626 this is symptomatic of the fact that our company is getting more global and more consistent the exceptions are the video download service and some of the specifics of the psp and ps2 promotions
1242627 ps3 80gb we will introduce this in the pal markets on august 27 it will be a simultaneous release it will come in at eur 399 gbp 299 and we will be doing promotional bundles from the middle of september to the end of december at various prices the 80gb replaces the 40gb
1242628 we will launch platinum for ps3 on august 1 so thats the same time frame as north america the suggested retail price will be eur 29 99 and gbp 19 99
1242629 i was suprised to hear that square soft has a game in development for the revolution
1242630 the consensus among these learned types is that the two systems have comparable gpus despite using different companies ati and nvidia but that the cpus are a completely different story word from the geek is that the ps3s cpu is about three times faster than the xbox 360s cpu while this seems like a clear cut victory for sony it does little to end the constant debate about which system will be able to provide better games the problem with sonys super fast cpu is that not all of its power may actually be usable in games bottom line there could be a lot of extraneous horsepower under the ps3s hood thats mainly for show not actual gaming

1242647 i really want to have a new start i just want people to know ive worked really hard
1242648 we are grateful that the cbbf subjected julie coram to a prompt fair and reliable drug test
1242649 the results were not at all surprising to us she tested absolutely clean she had no traces whatsoever of any banned substances in her sample julie has been exonerated
1242650 it has no bearing on the test we did at the time of the show it came back positive
1242651 some of these substances stay in the system a long time others dont
1242652 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1242653 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1242654 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1242655 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1242656 i enjoy training more than competing what i really enjoy is the act of training i like the results i see training in the gym gives me immediate gratification and the pain i feel from the training is what i can embrace and is a form of gratification itself being on stage makes me very nervous and i realize its a necessary evil i just hope ill lose some of the nervousness as i compete more often
1242657 i didnt really feel i was ready for that contest
1242658 and when i saw lenda i pretty much knew the show was over she was amazing i really didnt have a problem losing to her because she already looked like a pro
1242659 im trying to look at it not as competing against other women but competing against myself with other women on stage its only natural to compare yourself to other people but youll go crazy if you do you can only govern how hard you work to look your best you cant govern how good someone else is going to look im pleased with my progress and feel ive gotten better with each show but you can only go so far so quickly
1242660 i guess it was a combination of things made me decide to get on with life i really got caught up in the desire to win and it can be intoxicating so when i didnt win i got discouraged and depressed while i was competing i liked the idea of being recognized on the street and i definitely enjoyed my 15 minutes of fame and all the attention but i had been very tunnel focused during that time and i just decided i didnt want to chase that dream anymore the dedication i had as a bodybuilder had run its course and at that point i was satisfied to watch chris duffy continue his competitive career
1242661 i was still very close to the bodybuilding scene after i stopped competing
1242662 chris was actively competing at the time and i went to all the shows he entered in cluding the masters mr olympia by 1991 i was divorced from vinnie and chris and i moved back to florida together and weve been here ever since
1242663 and it was really stupid it has a lot to do with the crowd you find yourself hanging out with and i ended up going along for the ride i was glad i matured beyond that part of my life before i did permanent damage to myself
1242664 i can lift those 130 pound bull mastiffs up to the table for their grooming and trim and most groomers cant do that its a great career and i love it i love animals and caring for them is very fulfilling
1242665 people are always asking me if im going to compete its flattering but i only weigh 110 pounds now which is only five pounds less than when she entered her first contest in 1987 and thats a long way from when i weighed 130 as a heavyweight at the north americans im still lean and the vascularity is nuts i have genetically muscular legs that will never go away so when people tell me im in great shape i take it as a compliment especially since i dont train seriously at all
1242666 when he introduces me to new people he still calls me
1242667 my biggest worry with pietersen is that he gets a bit far above himself and doesnt keep his feet on the ground hes got to remember who his friends are if he keeps that in mind he will be all right he has as much talent as anyone that has ever played the game
1242668 i had seen this variation some time back black needs to be very careful and very well prepared it is hard to find the right defense with limited time on the clock
1242669 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in
1242670 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1242671 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1242672 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1242673 five more long weeks of higher than necessary prices at the pump
1242674 like george bush and dick cheney before him sees more drilling as the answer to all of our problems
1242675 the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain
1242676 so when sen mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis
1242677 its important to remember that hes been part of that failure
1242678 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1242679 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1242680 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups

1242685 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1242686 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1242687 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1242688 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1242689 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1242690 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1242691 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1242692 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism

1242700 youre trading a future stream of revenue for cash right now once the cash is spent its gone
1242701 you wouldnt find yourself in this fix if you had a revenue system that could deliver an adequate amount of revenue every year to make the investments you need and provide services
1242702 it will be an important step at a very critical time for us in terms of the systems overall needs
1242703 as the marketplace becomes more complex does the state evolve in order to maximize our returns or do we operate more traditionally
1242704 i think we have to look at it on a case by case basis
1242705 it happens in the private sector and corporate sector so there is a structure in place
1242706 the timing seems right the markets seem appropriate and it makes sense to move forward at this time
1242707 thats fair comment and its good to see that nothing has changed in the game that it comes down to that most often
1242708 we got stuck into them australia and thats what counts in the game when its all said and done we have a responsibility now to use that as a yard stick for the rest of our matches the next challenge for us to lay the same sort of platform and show the same sort of passion
1242709 we are trying to bring through a lot of young players and if you can bring them through in that sort of environment when you can lay it out like that its got to be good for new zealand rugby and the future
1242710 the coaches drove home to us all week that our attitude wasnt up to par last week we had to set our intentions straight from the get go in this match our message was to be aggressive with the ball in hand and it would keep them out of the game
1242711 two or three months ago these developments would have prompted a buying frenzy
1242712 however relatively minor supply side events can be easily absorbed within an environment of surplus product supplies and declining demand
1242713 it seems like a combination of people discounting the threat and how quickly it looks like its going to disappear
1242714 currently there are no plans to shut down the refinery
1242715 if its only a couple of days well be ok
1242716 if we start going to five or six days well be impacted
1242717 now i am describing what its like to practice the trend
1242718 though in a slightly different way perhaps being from a different geographic area or socioeconomic group
1242719 i may have an answer to the counter trend arguments
1242720 chiefly i have wry conflicted feelings about following trends generally but neither am i willing to abandon my allegiance to the trend purely because i have been identified as part of the trend
1242721 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1242722 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1242723 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward there can be no breakup of sanzar absolutely not sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying

1242730 these standards are very bad which is why the nut will not accept that it is reasonable and fair on our children to allow such things to happen
1242731 nobody should be allowed to teach in classrooms without appropriate training and qualifications
1242732 our policy is that every class and every lesson should be taught by a qualified teacher assisted by a properly trained and qualified teaching assistant
1242733 they are being exploited once they are there you can ask them to do other duties a teacher needs to do and that is clearly not fair
1242734 childrens education is definitely suffering because an instructor has to learn how to teach on the job unless they are taken away for a few weeks on a course kids will get a second rate education
1242735 all school staff employed to have regular responsibility for a class in a school will need to satisfy the headteacher that they can provide a suitably stimulating and rigorous experience for their pupils suffolk homes

1242746 its good to work in with the community to try and solve these sorts of problems and in particular the wellington city council working alongside them has been fantastic
1242747 its an issue that we have been supporting and certainly the proactivity of the council has been appreciated by retailers and others
1242748 weve been monitoring it to make sure its well managed and isnt unduly expensive and it doesnt seem to be so were pretty positive about it and its achieved quite a lot in some areas of the city

1242783 your cousins gone it couldve been you it couldve been any of these boys
1242784 it is imperative that bill deweese resign as majority leader
1242785 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign
1242786 i am saddened that josh would take this public shot at me
1242787 technically hes not a part of leadership but he is the symbolic head of the reform movement so his comments carry weight
1242788 will be a terrible distraction for democrats in the fall when we have serious issues to deal with such as health care transportation and the poor economy mr yudichak said
1242789 it would have been more appropriate for josh to request or if he feels that strongly demand for leaders to bring the caucus together on this issue in private
1242790 people who take on a mountain like k 2 have to be prepared to write themselves off and im not
1242791 you have to be very comfortable with the chance you wont come back but thats part of the allure the risk
1242792 its high hard requires every skill and is more difficult than you can imagine
1242793 the reason ive chosen not to climb it is because i have a family
1242794 or theyre mamas boys and their mamas wont let them climb it
1242795 but ultimately it was an avalanche that killed them an ice fall is impossible to predict this was an absolute tragedy when the ice broke loose and tore out the ropes
1242796 the department store segment is not going to get better
1242797 theyve got to get the back to school merchandise on track fast
1242798 boscovs to its credit was a very solidly run company
1242799 were just hoping the developer has some funding to help us with relocation
1242800 if you look at it as an entrance to the community of squirrel hill it would be nice if it was a building that is aesthetically pleasing
1242801 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
1242802 its just as easy to offer to give things away we would love to have free health care for everyone in allegheny county and im sure a ballot measure for that would pass but youve got to pay for things so we have to be realistic
1242803 its unfortunate that fact was required to devote so much time and effort to collect so many signatures
1242804 but it is heartening that tens of thousands of voters were eager to put their name on the dotted line and express their opposition
1242805 he has been working very hard to re establish his relationship with the kids
1242806 she said it was a very simple argument something she didnt think would be blown out of proportion
1242807 when he turned around she ran he was alive when she left
1242808 if youre married and you cant get along you should separate because this is what can happen
1242809 dannys family want desperately to find out where his body is and what happened to him
1242810 i can cut open a body but i dont mess with bugs
1242811 the population of environmental health sciences is unpredictable and this program is a chance to create a pipeline to future health sciences careers
1242812 were going to run out of good people if we dont reach down
1242813 all of these kids are very bright we need this kind of pathway to connect to these sorts of jobs many dont have a good idea of the opportunities in public health
1242814 i want to do something in science or the medical fields but im not sure what exactly this gives me the experience to make a decision
1242815 before i didnt realize all that researchers did this has opened my eyes to a lot of opportunities
1242816 im running tests on different drugs to see if they can relax the blood vessels of mice
1242817 this course shows me whats available in the medical field
1242818 this is a new experience on the river and its good to learn that the rivers are cleaner and healthier but also whats in the water
1242819 ive been able to learn how research is actually done the procedures and that has inspired me to keep going on i like the hands on experience
1242820 oh this one isnt working any longer god give me strength
1242821 well i have to give you back your deposit rental of 15 00
1242822 yes you have to make another 15 00 rental for your dvr exchange it is company policy
1242823 despite its somber themes claudia millss newest novel sparkles like a glass of ginger ale peppery and sweet
1242824 i havent heard that yet so im still in the same mind set im at the bottom of the totem pole
1242825 but thats why we have these preseason games so i can show them
1242826 i just have to show them how i play against full contact
1242827 just be consistent no mental errors and run all the plays right with no mistakes hold on to the ball and make positive plays
1242828 martys not a real vocal guy but he leads pretty much by example
1242829 guys can go to him and hes not one of those guys who isnt going to give the guys the time that they need he knows a few little tricks of the trade as far as it relates to getting open and hes constantly sharing those things with those guys
1242830 sometimes thats real important because as a coach you tell a guy something over and over again but im not out there playing
1242831 sometimes a guy thats out there can give them a little bit more insight or confirm some of the things that ive been telling them
1242832 we play this game because we like sundays but we have to put in that hard work it starts in training camp so yeah im happy to be out here
1242833 because to be honest i cant see how you can be so into mouse clicking
1242834 i think it might look different because its 3d but a game can still look the same while upgrading the graphics

1242850 we will make efforts both on the production and consumption sides to ensure this trend
1242851 the city has some of the worst congestion in china we were worried there would be traffic difficulties and also that the crowds would be too large
1242852 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1242853 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1242854 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1242855 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1242856 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1242857 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1242858 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1242859 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1242860 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip

1242862 kljub bolj im rezultatom na podro ju zatiranja gospodarske kriminalitete se v policiji zavedamo da je mogo e na tem podro ju narediti e ve
1242863 slednje je posledica tudi ve je prisotnosti policije na terenu
1242864 i have never visited yasukuni on august 15 and i will maintain that stance
1242865 not something i do as a person holding a public position
1242866 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen we agree and are totally confident these checks will confirm the integrity of our engineering and maintenance operations and our commitment to safety
1242867 the dispute over the ownership of the wahaha brand which lasted more than one year was finally settled and it was affirmed that wahaha brand belongs to wahaha
1242868 danone will continue to pursue all legal options to protect its contractual rights and financial interests
1242869 we would never give up solving the issue through talks but it has to be based on mutual respect we definitely cannot accept danones valuation
1242870 we applied with the games organisers to order an extra long bed after the good luck beijing test events in april
1242871 back then all the clinical beds here were just 2 1 metres long and were very uncomfortable for the patients
1242872 of course we hope no one gets injured and all the athletes play well at the games
1242873 in declining markets we see more demand for products which reduce the operational costs of a business
1242874 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1242875 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1242876 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1242877 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1242878 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1242879 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1242880 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1242881 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1242882 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
1242883 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
1242884 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
1242885 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
1242886 this is a set back which should be overcome soon
1242887 the memorandum of agreement which was supposed to be signed today is within the constitutional authority and within the legal authority
1242888 we stand by that that is why we are confident our supreme court will find this to be resolved
1242889 hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there
1242890 its in the deltoid below my shoulder strength is fine velocity is fine
1242891 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1242892 i am delighted that lyxor has chosen the london stock exchange to launch the worlds first etf focused on kuwait this launch is great news for investors as it provides them with the opportunity to access to kuwaits fast growing banking telecom and it sectors while benefiting from the low cost instant diversification offered by etfs
1242893 the results for the second quarter 2008 are further proof of the earnings power of deutsche b rse group despite weaker business activity in some areas of the group due to the general uncertainty in financial markets we were able to increase our earnings in the second quarter also without the additional contribution of ise the record results for the first half of the year confirm our expectation for earnings growth in 2008 against the previous year
1242894 deutsche b rse group continued to be well on track in the first half of 2008 we work efficiently and successfully in current unfavorable market conditions thus we make an important contribution to stabilize the financial system
1242895 we would like to inform you that the company is always considering and exploring various options of expansion of its capacity in india as well as overseas
1242896 the company has firmed up its plans to increase its market penetration from its overseas operations in uae and china into east african markets which includes south africa madagascar tanzania further to this no new international subsidiary has been planned
1242897 this pricing structure incentivises participants to retain order flow in new zealand many of these nzx dual listed issuers have a large number of new zealand based shareholders to date trading activity has been largely directed to australia the aim of this pricing change is retain activity and grow liquidity on nzx markets offering a cost effective model for those trading in these stocks
1242898 in the current economic environment an increasing number of short term interest rate instruments are linked to the overnight fed funds rate
1242899 our new contract will be a welcome means of hedging ois linked risk exposure combining the new 3 month ois contract with our benchmark eurodollar futures will enable efficient trading of the fed funds libor spread which has grown increasingly volatile creating substantial risk for money market participants the contract will also provide a direct way to take a view on fomc policy moves further out the yield curve than is possible with our existing 30 day fed funds contracts
1242900 we are delighted to receive this recognition from the dfsa and to be able to offer the full range of our listed derivatives products in all asset classes to the fast growing difc community
1242901 we look forward to working with the dfsa to continue providing cme group s world leading products and services within the difc for both local and global customers
1242902 building on a record first quarter we continued to experience strong customer demand across our core businesses and to execute well against our corporate strategy
1242903 our results reflect the strength and earnings potential of our highly diverse business model and our ability to post gains even in the most challenging times while maintaining our focus on expense management we have strengthened our trading infrastructure and competitive position with investments in new technology we have also made strategic investments to extend our global footprint including the 25 stake in qatar s doha securities market and have laid the groundwork for our u s futures businesses
1242904 nyse euronext remains on track to achieve technology and non technology savings targets related to the nyse euronext merger and we expect to realize future synergy opportunities from the pending aems and american stock exchange transactions
1242905 beyond the cost saves we are also committed to investing in growth which includes broadening our product and service portfolio in both core businesses and new ventures our capital allocation will be appropriately balanced between investing in our future and returning capital to our shareholders as evidenced by our 1 billion stock repurchase program
1242906 this is not mayor daleys debt this is the people of the city of chicago
1242907 now they dont want their taxes to go up 48 million do they no we just say just pay your debt
1242908 if youre struggling with poverty and all that we have programs you can work on we have all these programs that you can work on you come in and say im on welfare im doing this and that we can put you on a program
1242909 i would think that three tickets now seems to be working all right and with the economic conditions that our constituents are facing i dont think adding this additional burden to their already beleaguered economic existence is a good idea
1242910 it is going too far in terms of our approach of collecting revenue from scofflaws because there are a lot of people with two tickets who are willing to pay their tickets who feel they didnt have adequate notice
1242911 government has to be fair to all our citizens especially if we are going to take property and booting a car is taking property
1242912 its not surprising that the amount generated continues to grow because parking and traffic enforcement has been a point of emphasis of the city
1242913 we strongly encourage the city to go after to the fullest extent possible any violators as long as the city affords due process and fair hearings
1242914 it seems they are just taking it to the next level
1242915 even when you are parking legally you just cant park downtown i am going to have to rent a space at a garage because im afraid to park anywhere
1242916 there are areas that are more congested than others and areas where people are more likely to park on the street because they dont have garages or other off street parking
1242917 that is why all these cameras are being installed the reality is that people blow through these intersections and they are going to be caught and they are going to be fined it has become a big revenue source absolutely
1242918 have decided it is a lot smarter making their money on volume and keeping the price low
1242919 if they stick to that pattern they can generate a lot of money with very little political flak
1242920 he said there used to be a sign on that pole and it hasnt been there for two years my logical question was how can you write a ticket and he told me he doesnt want to but his boss tells him he has to go out every day and write tickets
1242921 i just think of all the suburbanites coming here for cubs games
1242922 they dont know how to contest a ticket they just pay it
1242923 yes it is a significant source of revenue but our responsibility is to collect in an equitable manner
1242924 people are given an opportunity to exercise their rights to dispute the ticket that doesnt mean mistakes arent made if they are made we work to resolve the issue to the best of our ability
1242925 those numbers have been consistent for 10 years and the numbers dont lie
1242926 most people who contest a parking ticket prevail and if people do not agree with the decision of the administrative law officer they have the ability to appeal to the circuit court
1242927 kids stop i dropped the keys we need to go back
1242928 even with all that horse power they didnt talk about network traffic running all exchange 2007 roles on the same box i wonder how long one of these boxes takes to vmotion also id like to know the details on how they setup the luns and if they used vmdk files

1242932 removing computers medicine and money and using a steel cylinder battering ram to get into the upstairs bedrooms
1242933 trash counters strewn with open and empty glass jars piles of receipts thrown on the ground upturned couch cushions bits of marijuana on the edges of counters and an atm with its doors torn open and emptied an outdoor vegetable garden had plants uprooted along with marijuana plants removed by the agents
1242934 zo krampachtig tegenover deelname van militairen staat terwijl staatssecretaris van der knaap van defensie vorig jaar nog samen met vele militairen deelnam aan roze maandag en het zomercarnaval in rotterdam
1242935 ik heb altijd graag naar madrid gewild want ik heb iets met spanje
1242936 toen kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions leaguewedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze
1242937 ik heb uitvoerig met ruud gesproken en wil en kan niet anders dan zijn besluit respecteren
1242938 uiteraard ga je bij dit soort beslissingen niet over n nacht ijs ik heb met oranje een heel fijn europees kampioenschap achter de rug en kijk daar met een goed gevoel op terug
1242939 wir wollten zeigen wie vielf ltig die anwendungsgebiete von beschichtungen sind und diese vielf ltigkeit m glichst vielen unternehmen die sich f r oberfl chentechnik beschichtungen sowie deren herstellungs und untersuchungsmethoden interessieren verst ndlich machen
1242940 nat rlich gibt es auch auf diesem gebiet gen gend fachliteratur aber nur wenige m glichkeiten um sich als am thema interessierter laie einen berblick zu verschaffen
1242941 wij gaan goed aan de slag met de enschedese formule want er zijn elders in het land soms nog grote knelpunten
1242942 ik ben blij met deze aanpak en zal deze succesformule elders in het land uitdragen
1242943 the procedures for a pardon are open to any and all citizens convicted of one or another crime including khodorkovsky
1242944 this is not a request for absolution or amnesty it is something all prisoners who have served their sentences apply for and the majority receive a conditional release
1242945 for my own part let me add they are falsifying the evidence and all this is encouraged by the courts failure to intervene
1242946 theft through embezzlement and the legalisation of the money acquired as a result of a large scale crime
1242947 being manoeuvred by the powers that be with the intention of reining in the class of rich oligarchs and sidelining potential or declared political adversaries
1242948 we will provide tangible solutions to the 21st century challenges of urbanisation mature economies ageing populations and how to safeguard and improve the environment
1242949 we will be very happy if we can possibly deliver a model for the mega cities which wish to host mega events
1242950 two recent independent surveys show that 70 percent of japanese close to 100 million people already support our bid and this figure is rising all the time
1242951 the 2016 games will be a catalyst for our greatest ever drive for sports participation especially at both ends of the age spectrum and result in the worlds greatest metropolitan makeover
1242952 the games coming to china is a remarkable step in the history of the olympic movement
1242953 we firmly believe tokyo in 2016 would allow the olympics to make another step forward
1242954 there will be no signing tomorrow i got a call from the supreme court
1242955 do not build a berlin wall among the people in mindanao
1242956 reasonably well albeit with less momentum than in the recent past
1242957 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1242958 never give anyone advice for the second it does not work you are going to become the target of their anger
1242959 this person does not know the complete story has not been through what i have and what they are suggesting is a book answer that applies to people with one disorder and not someone with four concurrent disorders
1242960 between ketu and palmgrove bus stop i paid n200 for an okada ride of less than 10 minutes the brt which could have alleviated our problems were nowhere to be found because most of them could not turn up at various points
1242961 i have been here as early as 7 30am and i have not boarded my bus it is really pathetic to most of us who are leaving far
1242962 if the yaba oyingbo and other link roads were put in order people would spend less hours in traffic
1242963 many of the roads are riddled with potholes worsening the traffic situation we have spent more than three hours from ikorodu to yaba a journey that is less than 30 minutes
1242964 i thought that by today we will not be able to move but i am surprised that i spent the same two hours i normally spend from ajah to cms
1242965 unlike saturday there has been no problem no casualty and no incidents today
1242966 we thank the public for keeping simple laws and with their help the magic promised is really working
1242967 we are not saying that the roads are completely free of traffic jams but we will ensure that it is free flowing
1242968 there will be no commercial motorcyclists no walking and no hawking on the bridge to avoid casualty as we lost three commercial motorcyclists on saturday who rode against traffic
1242969 politians came around with well oiled speeches on local issues especially concerning water but despite requests put in to the sde we still dont have any water lines
1242970 the early birds are luckiest they can get water for the whole day
1242971 i get disturbed all hours of the night by women who want me to check the water faucet and since at midday the water gets cut off they have to turn to the wells for water for cooking
1242972 well water should be treated but theres no alternative we dont even have faucets and plumbing in the house
1242973 the water here is something special sometimes you turn on the faucet and nothing comes or its red and tastes really bad but we deal with it
1242974 there have been increases in production costs since 2003 yet the price of water has stayed the same
1242975 e isso mudou toda a minha vida nunca sonhei em participar de uma olimp ada e agora estou aqui
1242976 estava perto de fazer 30 anos me recuperava de duas les es e n o tinha um parceiro de dupla estava pensando em trabalhar com os neg cios da minha fam lia nunca imaginei que isto aconteceria

1242984 os atletas devem atualizar estas informa es quantas vezes for necess rio para que estejam sempre em dia
1242985 mr solana will be in touch with the authorities of china france germany russia the united kingdom and the united states
1242986 during the phone conversation the freeze for freeze issue will not be discussed like the last talks in geneva they will only discuss the common points of the two packages
1242987 all of our rooms were renovated earlier this year just before spring festival if you come by to see them im sure youll be satisfied
1242988 only about one tenth of the domestic tourists who are planning on coming to beijing over the games have made reservations in advance
1242989 mr owens letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands
1242990 they have only agreed a list of questions to be discussed in order for a ceasefire to be agreed

1243003 de effectiviteit van deze stenen is echter vele malen groter omdat deze zich veel dichter bij de bron van de vervuiling bevinden
1243004 dakpannen bevinden zich op een aantal meters hoogte de stikstofoxide waait weg waardoor er een veel beperkter deel wordt gezuiverd bovendien bestrijk je met een hele straat een veel groter oppervlak
1243005 je kunt dan als samenleving twee dingen doen of je beperkt het autogebruik door bijvoorbeeld alleen wagens met even kentekens te laten rijden of je gaat als wetenschap op zoek naar oplossingen dat laatste proberen wij te doen
1243006 de luchtzuiverende straatstenen hoeven in ieder geval niet eerder vervangen te worden dan gewoon materiaal
1243007 in open asfalt in de poreuze ruimten is het misschien denkbaar maar het effect de opbrenst is nihil en eigenlijk te verwaarlozen
1243008 het is niet zo dat mensen het straks kunnen ruiken of zo

1243016 all men profess honesty as long as they can to believe all men honest would be folly to believe none so is something worse
1243017 courage and perseverance have a magical talisman before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air
1243018 if your actions inspire others to dream more learn more do more and become more you are a leader
1243019 why do you always have to try to do something about things
1243020 to see a wrong and not to expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance
1243021 men in general are quick to believe that which they wish to be true
1243022 it is difficult for the common good to prevail against the intense concentration of those who have a special interest especially if the decisions are made behind locked doors
1243023 i sometimes wish that people would put a little more emphasis upon the observance of the law than they do upon its enforcement
1243024 the world is a dangerous place not because of those who do evil but because of those who look on and do nothing
1243025 dont join the book burners do not think you are going to conceal thoughts by concealing evidence that they ever existed
1243026 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1243027 the truth will set you free but first it will make you miserable
1243028 an error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation nor does truth become error because nobody sees it
1243029 there is nothing more corrupting nothing more destructive of the noblest and finest feelings of our nature than the exercise of unlimited power
1243030 the unrestricted competition so commonly advocated does not leave us the survival of the fittest the unscrupulous succeed best in accumulating wealth
1243031 honor is not the exclusive property of any political party
1243032 it is just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business
1243033 you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you mad
1243034 any man worth his salt will stick up for what he believes right but it takes a slightly better man to acknowledge instantly and without reservation that he is in error
1243035 i weep for the liberty of my country when i see at this early day of its successful experiment that corruption has been imputed to many members of the house of representatives and the rights of the people have been bartered for promises of office
1243036 it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their own selfish purposes
1243037 the duty of government is to leave commerce to its own capital and credit as well as all other branches of business protecting all in their legal pursuits granting exclusive privileges to none
1243038 nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude
1243039 timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty
1243040 when angry count to ten before you speak if very angry count to one hundred
1243041 do you want to know who you are dont ask act action will delineate and define you
1243042 merchants have no country the mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains
1243043 outside of the constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizens and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us this broad principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects
1243044 change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future
1243045 efforts and courage are not enough without purpose and direction
1243046 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1243047 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
1243048 to stand in silence when they should be protesting makes cowards out of men
1243049 stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong
1243050 few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense the thought that the state has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable and so the evidence has to be internally denied
1243051 the great mass of people will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one
1243052 the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1243053 it becomes more necessary to see the truth as it is if you realize that the only vehicle for change are these people who have lost their personality
1243054 change means movement movement means friction only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict
1243055 we must believe that it is the darkest before the dawn of a beautiful new world we will see it when we believe it
1243056 cautious careful people always casting about to preserve their reputations can never effect a reform
1243057 no man or woman who tries to pursue an ideal in his or her own way is without enemies
1243058 the last struggle for our rights the battle for our civilization is entirely with ourselves
1243059 we draw our strength from the very despair in which we have been forced to live we shall endure
1243060 you are never strong enough that you dont need help
1243061 censorship is never over for those who have experienced it it is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it forever
1243062 do something if it doesnt work do something else no idea is too crazy
1243063 if you do not speak up when it matters when would it matter that you speak the opposite of courage is conformity even a dead fish can go with the flow
1243064 so now is the time more than ever for those who truly value all the principles of democracy especially including dissent to be the most forceful in speaking up standing up and speaking out
1243065 the corporations dont have to lobby the government anymore they are the government
1243066 treat all men alike give them the same law give them an even chance to live and grow
1243067 expedience not justice is the rule of contemporary american law
1243068 i believe that no man who holds a leaders position should ever accept favors from either side he is then committed to show favors a leader must stand alone
1243069 pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living
1243070 the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict
1243071 its the little things citizens do thats what will make the difference my little thing is planting trees
1243072 all i was doing was trying to get home from work
1243073 truth often suffers more by the heat of its defenders than the arguments of its opposers
1243074 justice is never given it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final fact but a continuing evolving process to higher and higher levels of human social economic political and religious relationship
1243075 you may have to fight a battle more than once to win it
1243076 dont let it end like this tell them i said something

1243114 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1243115 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1243116 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1243117 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1243118 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure
1243119 it was a shocking and brutal murder one can only imagine the pain and suffering her family has gone through
1243120 after seven years investigators have still been receiving new information about this crime which gives everyone renewed hope that the answers are out there
1243121 the coroner has covered all aspects of the investigation and made appropriate recommendations which we will take on board
1243122 eighty one million tonnes of co2 abatement each year by 2020 is around 20 per cent of australias total carbon abatement targets

1243130 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1243131 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1243132 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz

1243134 rm has sold more investment quality ferraris than any other auction house in history
1243135 our clients have entrusted us over the years in acquiring the finest examples of the legendary ferrari marque for their collections

1243139 there are incentives that will pay up to 50 depending on income a lot of people will qualify for at least 10 in state subsidies
1243140 you cant do the same old thing thats not going to save you that much
1243141 the majority of houses were going into are saving 30 40 sometimes 50 on utilities
1243142 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1243143 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1243144 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1243145 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1243146 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1243147 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1243148 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1243149 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth

1243155 the police investigation in the early period following ms childs death unfortunately did not capture some items of evidence which are no longer available to the current investigating police
1243156 to avoid a similar situation occurring it is recommended that the nsw police force conducts a review of its procedures regarding the notification to the homicide unit of suspicious deaths and the subsequent investigation of such matters

1243164 i thought you said you wanted to rest up today
1243165 well what the hell why not just plug the phone cord in and splice the wires on
1243166 the odds probably show you that its not likely hell play in nhl next year
1243167 if it doesnt work out at the nhl he goes down and hes going to be playing a ton down in hartford
1243168 for once in a lifetime a man has a moment
1243169 well have tests just so we can rule out everything it kind of grabbed and it was a little bit tighter in the fifth inning
1243170 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1243171 i knew it was gone right when it came off the bat he threw a fastball and i put a good swing on it
1243172 it was big because of the way that we did it against the team we did it against factoring in the circumstances
1243173 it doesnt hurt in the wrong places to be concerned
1243174 im not really concerned that hes going to be shut down for a while but theres a chance that hes going to have to miss a start
1243175 you wait for the test see what that reveals and you deal with the situation
1243176 joba has been throwing the ball well for us well have to see what comes of this
1243177 he could be an ace going to the postseason for us so hopefully its nothing major
1243178 but before we can even think about the postseason we need to start winning these ballgames right now this was a missed opportunity
1243179 just focusing back on what i need to do as far as going out there and having a really good year thats why i just want to put the rest of the stuff out of my mind for right now just really concentrate on football and let the business side take care of the business side
1243180 i just wanted to be able to come in with a clear mind
1243181 it was something that i hoped could be a possibility like i said i let them worry about the rest of it and i am just focusing on my end of it i have to hold my end up
1243182 chris brings a style to our offense where he can not only block but he can run and catch the football
1243183 one thing he has worked on over the years is his route running being crisper in his routs having a higher tempo really gotten better at that become a complete tight end i am looking forward to him getting in the swing of things to see what he can help us with
1243184 they are all intelligent guys and they are all guys that can do different things

1243218 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never known neither victory nor defeat

1243305 these hanging merlot grapes at in bridgehampton ny are picking up the light from the sunday morning sun the remnants of rain from the night before slowly evaporate or drip down to the soil below

1243307 unlike other vineyards along neighboring finger lakes we protect our vines from the cold after the fall harvest one by one we carefully remove them from the trellises and bury them in the rich earth to insulate the sensitive primary buds which eventually become the fruit

1243317 all vodkas retain some character notes of the original raw material that they are made from potato vodka will taste different then vodkas made from grains other vodkas can be characterized with an ethanol smelling nose and heavy burn on the finish we are actually using the traditional european style method which is a more complex coupled with a more expensive raw material for making vodka then other comparable vodkas
1243318 yes and as you can imagine we will be focused on using local crops that are available
1243319 2007 was a very ripe year so composing these rieslings from different lots was almost like a gamble

1243394 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1243395 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists
1243396 the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

1243428 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
1243429 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
1243430 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
1243431 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
1243432 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
1243433 we have solid data to show that the situation is far more severe than we imagined

1243439 i guarantee it will never effect to anyones skin at all
1243440 my face is getting better after i first use only ten days
1243441 you should have left that monster when you were given the choice
1243442 i assure you my movements from the moment of your contact have been quite carefully planned indeed it would be foolish not to return the threat of death if you work alone this shall be ended
1243443 to bring what is between me and god into the worship session
1243444 to draw near to god to praise and worship him
1243445 to be in a posture of prayer and to intercede
1243446 to exalt gods agenda and not to hinder people from meeting god
1243447 for people to have the freedom to dialogue with god that they might be released deeper into gods will
1243448 that it might be exhibited that we are worshiping a god who is alive
1243449 holy holy holy is the lord almighty the whole earth is full of his glory

1243451 see this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for
1243452 whom shall i send and who will go for us
1243453 let us go into a time of silence and allow god to speak to our hearts
1243454 to indicate the flow of the worship and of the holy spirit

1243459 for the first time ive seen iraqi security forces that can plan prepare and execute first class offensive operations
1243460 ive also seen a high level of trust and respect by the people of rashid for their own army and police forces
1243461 together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
1243462 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
1243463 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1243464 emplaced by special group criminals who operate as part of the illegal militias in baghdad
1243465 i think they want to undermine the government and theyre using the neighborhoods of rashid as a battlefield
1243466 there seemed to be a wedge that was placed between the people and the insurgents and we tried to exploit that
1243467 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminals and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district
1243468 we have captured more than 170 special group criminals associated with the jaysh al mahdi militia
1243469 seizing on the improved security conditions we are pursuing reconstruction projects to improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1243470 weve also proposed an additional 117 projects valued at more than 26 million
1243471 each project is coordinated with the rashid district council leadership to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the people
1243472 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
1243473 we have been calling continually for greater transparency in the energy futures markets and anything short of full disclosure to the general public fails to meet the definition of transparency
1243474 we understand the need for cftc to process the data it is collecting but it is imperative to share that data with the american public with the utmost speed
1243475 the agency has always been and continues to be committed to market integrity and to market transparency
1243476 include recommendations for improved practices and controls should they be required
1243477 senior administration officials including but not limited to the secretary of treasury and the secretary of energy have already opined in recent weeks and months that speculators are not having an impact on the record rise in crude oil prices
1243478 im not surprised therefore that the staff who work for them and who comprise the staff of the task force have not contradicted their superiors in this study
1243479 the timing for obamas pick is not nearly as big an issue as it is for mccain

1243481 one stop resource for organizing non partisan information on the 2008 presidential elections

1243484 berdasarkan keputusan rapat itu dprd menilai ada permasalahan di sisi hulunya yakni jober pertamina pangkallalang
1243485 keterangan ini mengindikasikan masalah distribusi bbm berawal dari sisi hulunya jober
1243486 setidaknya jober harus terbuka mengungkapkan kondisi tangki penampung kendala alur sungai yang membatasi kapasitas kapal angkutan dan sebagainya kalau dilihat dari selisih 1 hari waktu tempuh ini menunjukkan jober tidak mengantisipasi stok
1243487 ada terkesan pak kasmadi takut menjalankan kewenangannya sebagai pelaksana tugas harian secara operasional dia mendistribusikan bbm tetapi datanya tidak bisa di berikan didistribusikan

1243493 lucas who left the practice field at wofford college on friday with ice over his left eye has a broken nose fox said smith was kicked out of practice and sent back to charlotte
1243494 the suspension will cost smith more than 205 000 a fraction of his base salary fox also seemed to issue a stern warning toward smith and his future actions

1243568 five senses are not only means of knowledge amp that a fragment of reality sometimes reaches the intelligence in other ways because a fact is rare is no reason that it doesnt exists because a study is difficult is that the reason for not understanding it the amazing truths that we will discover are even now around us staring at us in the eye so to speak amp yet we do not see them but it is not enough to say that we do not see them we do not wish to see them for as soon as an unexpected or unfamiliar fact appears we try to fit it into the framework of the common places of acquired knowledge and we are indignant that any one should dare experiment it

1243610 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there at least not right away
1243611 ive never played a game before where i was fearful of my life
1243612 growing up in texas you see those kind of storms all the time and you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with ill stand out there in a rain storm all day long but if its thundering and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you got to get the fans out of there
1243613 that last lightning was real close when i was hitting and saw that lightning i said im done i couldnt concentrate it was crazy
1243614 even with the fans in the stand thats a dangerous situation im just glad we got through it ive never experienced that before we probably stayed out there an inning longer than we should have
1243615 ive never played a game before where i was fearful for my life
1243616 it actually looked like somebody stood above the the stadium with a zip loc bag and opened it up
1243617 the lightning in my opinion even though it lit up the skies it was deep and away from the ballpark
1243618 i had talked to the groundskeeper several times about the weather and he said there were possible storms coming in
1243619 i was concerned about the lightning when that last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1243620 i commend also the umpire crew wally bell of giving it the best effort to finish a ballgame and hanging with a 2 hour and 45 minute delay completely understanding the importance of games and races and try not to have them be five inning ballgames
1243621 it stinks because we were on the losing end of hit
1243622 you wait around all night theres really no other alternative its like a wasted day at work

1243627 four boys in a repressive environment who find freedom through this play
1243628 students 1 2 3 and 4 are characters outside of the shakespearean characters
1243629 its their story i get a buzz when i see what happens when you look at things through a different lens
1243630 it needs muscularity a pack of teenage boys generates an energy violence is always possible something happens with an all male environment there is a kind of mob mentality a different energy when there are no women around
1243631 forget about gender and sexuality its much more exciting if the characters are swept into something monumental and dangerous that was not in their minds to have the play itself push them to emotional abandon
1243632 my job as a director is to cast well and then to paraphrase british director richard eyre give the actors a comfortable loving environment and ask them to soar
1243633 what saddens me the most about our society is that for boys any behavior that shows intimacy is labeled and shamed dont cry dont be a sissy while girls are allowed to have best friends have sleepovers hold hands r amp j addresses that
1243634 a huge percentage of people have read romeo and juliet in high school and r amp j is a sexy story four good looking charismatic guys its a new way to enjoy a classic piece

1243636 i am in the final three and paul is not here i love this game
1243637 as of late we actually came to an understanding and so even though i spent you know 90 percent of the game hating paul now it is like oh ok it is not as big of a victory as i thought it would be
1243638 i think that a lot of things fell my way and i feel very fortunate for that um but i am here and thats an amazing feeling
1243639 i feel great about making it to the final three but i am worried i am not going to sit here and lie and say oh yeah ive known who it has been all along if it is nicole craig knows if it is craig nicole knows i dont think either one has targeted me
1243640 when i find out i have to run i know marks going to run full speed there should be no more running sweating squatting jumping trudging dangling nothing

1243817 with internet sports betting sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
1243818 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our sports betting company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
1243819 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
1243820 after starting an internet sports betting sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
1243821 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time

1243827 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way

1243834 i am very pleased by the senates bipartisan vote today to confirm general david petraeus as the next commander of u s central command and general raymond odierno to become the commander of multi national forces iraq
1243835 there is no doubt in my mind that general petraeus and general odierno are the two best men to assume these two critically important commands
1243836 general petraeus has won the admiration and respect of the entire country over the past eighteen months
1243837 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there

1243865 some people may want to keep paper books that they have emotional ties to just as some people still have vinyl records but we envision new generations will soon be reading digitally exclusively
1243866 were happy to sit down with them and get them started
1243867 theyre much cozier but people who are into electronic devices really like these
1243868 if youre a fast reader you could keep your fingers pretty busy
1243869 those who enjoy reading an actual book may not find this as pleasing because its an electronic device it doesnt have the same feel
1243870 in my opinion i dont believe its a threat to books
1243871 not at all the hand held book will always be the method of choice for the majority of readers
1243872 but in my opinion in these tough economic times its unlikely these devices will take libraries by storm

1243904 he prime minister nur hassein has replaced three ministers who resigned saturday two of them spoke to the media and expressed their disappointment with the prime ministers dismissal of the mayor of mogadishu he also appointed three other ministers for positions that were vacant the prime minister is saying that he did not seek an official resignation from seven other ministries who were said to have resigned so he is not ready to replace them for the time being
1243905 the bottom line of this political crisis was the dismissal of the mayor of mogadishu who is a key ally of the president well there are a number of key allies in the government in the military in the police and in the security services that are close to the president and it is sad to say the president perhaps felt that the prime minister would be going after these individuals so he is trying to show that he does not want his loyal supporters within the transitional federal government the police and the security to be released from their positions because they have fought with him they have been very trusted allies of him for so long
1243906 of course the prime ministers responsibility is to propose who he wants to be in his government and who he wants to dismiss but ultimately the president would have to sign and as long as the president does not approve the prime ministers whishes the game stays in favor of the president
1243907 well we have tension now political tension between the president and the prime minister there is also a very strong movement lobbying in parliament some parliamentarians who are allied with the prime minister are talking of motion of impeachment of the president some other parliamentarians are campaigning for a vote of no confidence for the prime ministers government in the parliament so the tension is rising

1243923 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1243924 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1243925 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1243926 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd

1244058 baba kishore kumar was like an ocean his life has so many things that people will be really interested to know i think this will be a good attempt to remember the singer actor as well as take him close to his fans it will have all the negative and positive aspects of his life
1244059 this film is the first bio epic to be made on a bollywood personality and perhaps second one after gandhi to be made on any indian personality
1244060 it was his sircars idea to make the film and he has done all the research
1244061 i brought shoojit home to discuss the idea with mummy and bhaiya amit kumar they liked the idea and he went forward with it
1244062 making a film on a real life character is very difficult i am happy that the company and shoojit have taken such a step to pay tribute to the great artist who has entertained the masses for decades
1244063 if it plans for any change they will have to take permission from us though we will not be in front the camera but will be constantly involved in the project from behind
1244064 the idea of quitting cropped up during a 17 hour flight
1244065 so if i can do without smoking in flight i am sure i can do without it on land too
1244066 im doing a period film after my next film whats your rashee but it is a little too early to talk about its details
1244067 i had put a disclaimer in jodhaa akbar still a controversy happened so i guess i will have to take more care as far as dealing with facts is concerned
1244068 i took harman much before his love story 2050 was released i think he is a good actor and not only that he is also a wonderful dancer and his comic timing is very good besides harman and priyanka look good together it doesnt matter if his film hasnt worked
1244069 i think bollywood has lost touch with literature we need to revive that practice we still have some lovely old classics that have not come to screen yet its just that we need to explore them rather than making remakes or sequels of other films
1244070 when i created my original stories for lagaan and swades i had to do a lot of research for jodhaa akbar i had to research on the facts of history with whats your rashee i have a ready story but the tough part is doing comedy
1244071 i havent done comedy ever it is difficult and the fact that i have based my story out of a book doesnt make it any easier for me in fact it has made it tougher for me
1244072 a film should not be known by the number of awards it gets i would rather have my film known by what it stands for the amount of critical acclaim it gets and the number of film festivals it goes to
1244073 i would never want to colour my mind with the anticipation of an award i only believe that the story should be well told
1244074 the producer would be the best person to answer why my voice was dubbed i dont want to create any issues id rather talk about my trip to los angeles where ive been invited to serve as grand marshal at the independence day parade on august 10
1244075 i believe bipasha basu and other bollywood queens got the honour earlier so im quite delighted
1244076 he never personally came down to look at my place i gave him design specifications on email and he instructed his assistants in mumbai to do the needful but its turned out beautifully
1244077 in fact upen and camilla have hardly had time together since they got involved they did get attracted to each other but after that she has been busy in italy and he in mumbai in fact she has been down in mumbai only once
1244078 even now upen plans to return from la in august via london to visit his family but he has no plans of meeting camilla in italy
1244079 we are pleased to welcome kevin everett as the grand marshal of the zippo 200
1244080 his story has inspired people all across the country especially those of us in this area who followed it so closely to have him here to start the race is a testament to his courage and determination and a real honor for us
1244081 supports the body against the internal causes of acne hormones diet and stress
1244082 diet has not been demonstrated to be of benefit in the treatment of acne
1244083 few well designed trials of its safety and efficacy exist
1244084 i was always told that diet has nothing to do with my acne i put acid on my face now theyre saying the science behind those opinions was bad
1244085 epidemiological studies of non western cultures have shown that people eating traditional low sugar diets have virtually no acne
1244086 when these people start eating a western diet they develop acne substantial peer reviewed research now clearly demonstrates the link between acne and nutrition dr loren cordain dr perricone dr murad and many other medical scientists have been on the cutting edge of some of that research
1244087 and most people know the idea that chocolate causes acne is a myth our message turns that negative association on its head in fact we now know that natural dark chocolate has 300 times the antioxidant capacity of blueberries
1244088 frutels chocolates for acne work because theyre sugar free and contain a nutritional formula that supports your body against the internal causes of acne
1244089 we all know that acne starts inside your body with hormones diet and stress and its obvious that the cleansers and creams on the market dont solve those problems
1244090 baba kishore kumar was like an ocean his life has so many things that people will be really interested to know i think this will be a good attempt to remember the singer actor as well as take him close to his fans it will have all the negative and positive aspects of his life

1244095 if it plans for any change they will have to take permission from us though we will not be in front the camera but will be constantly involved in the project from behind
1244096 i think that in 20 years chocolate will be like caviar
1244097 it will become so rare and so expensive that the average joe just wont be able to afford it
1244098 im afraid by the time we wake up to that fact it will be too late ive worked in ghana for 25 years and i can show you huge areas that can no longer support a crop
1244099 we needed someone with grace dignity charm class and a sound educational background to play the role rahul was our first choice thankfully he said yes
1244100 depends on how you define sizeable his role is pivotal to the plot and cannot be measured in terms of footage for the film to be effective it is important for rahul to be effective
1244101 ive met rahul just a few times over the years he seems to be great fun charming and intelligent
1244102 karan has known rahul and akshaye since childhood for long he has been looking for a place to accommodate rahul the ranbir konkona film allows him that space
1244103 the producer would be the best person to answer why my voice was dubbed i dont want to create any issues id rather talk about my trip to los angeles where ive been invited to serve as grand marshal at the independence day parade on august 10

1244185 el d a de hoy en unos momentos m s all de manera formal en el mero frente del issste estaremos haciendo la declaratoria final del plant n nacional 451 d as casi 16 meses y hoy lo que hemos discutido con los contingentes con las organizaciones sociales y populares del pa s es la necesidad de dar un paso cualitativo
1244186 vamos a un evento grande el 28 y 29 en la c mara de diputados a una gran convenci n nacional sobre seguridad social y levantar el plant n nos llama tambi n por el tema pemex por el tema laboral por el tema de la militarizaci n del pa s y de preparar en todos los estados el paro nacional el primero de septiembre
1244187 el comit esta en la elaboraci n de un documento que presentar la pr xima semana a los gobernadores de los estados y congresos locales donde vamos a sustentar de manera legal y jur dica que es totalmente improcedente la firma con elba esther gordillo
1244188 hoy estamos dando un paso cualitativo en la lucha contra la nefasta ley del issste y contra la aplicaci n del pacto firmado por elba esther gordillo y felipe calder n la alianza por la calidad de la educaci n y creemos que ha llegado el momento de aplicar nuevas estrategias y no frenar los mecanismos que nos garanticen la abrogaci n total de la ley y de la alianza
1244189 concretamos un paso m s para enfrentar la avanzada privatizadora sobre pemex y la creciente militarizaci n del pa s lo que demanda la preparaci n de un paro nacional tarea a la que regresaremos en todas las regiones donde hay presencia de la cnte
1244190 se analiz levantar el plantonissste para dar paso a nuevas estrategias que nos permitan dar pasos cualitativos sin dejar de tener como eje central la abrogaci n total de su criminal ley pero al mismo tiempo ser capaces de enfrentar otro atentado como el que pretenden aplicar con su alianza
1244191 nunca en los 65 a os de existencia del snte hab a sido tan denigrante el papel de gente como elba esther gordillo quien pretende atribuirse el derecho exclusivo de definir el final del mismo gremio y la desaparici n total de los derechos de los trabajadores
1244192 no ha sido ratificada como presidenta del snte y que est violando los propios estatutos que aprob en complicidad con el gobierno federal por lo que se encuentra fuera de cualquier norma estatutaria vigente y no cuenta con la representatividad del magisterio
1244193 rechazan su nefasta ley del issste su alianza perversa y la privatizaci n de pemex vamos con todo a preparar la huelga nacional para frenar cualquier intento de lesionar los derechos del pueblo de m xico

1244201 no hemos consolidado a plenitud los esquemas de transparencia y rendici n de cuentas en todos los componentes del sector educativo
1244202 me parece que ella ha tra do siempre el di logo y el acuerdo en t rminos institucionales y respetuosos cualquier acuerdo que se construya en el marco institucional legal de cara a los ciudadanos debe ser un acuerdo que promueva como es en su caso calidad y equidad
1244203 creo que en la medida que avancemos en este proceso podremos no solamente dentro de las instituciones sino en toda la agenda educativa rendir mejores cuentas sobre todo del uso del dinero de los ciudadanos
1244204 es el primer paso de una agenda a la que regresa el m rito de la transparencia y el esfuerzo
1244205 es un proceso que debe perfeccionarse y no debe dar marcha atr s garantiza que el m rito regrese a las aulas y que sea el nico par metro para que los maestros puedan obtener su ascenso

1244218 were trying to create a sense of value thats greater than the sum of its parts like a carrol shelby mustang
1244219 this is something that we think could grow in value over time were going to limit the signature series to a maximum 500 trucks the first year all owners will receive a numbered plaque in their trucks and access to an owners registry online
1244220 we didnt design the truck to jump and its not designed as a race truck

1244242 somewhere down the line were going to try to replace him it wont be easy
1244243 i think theres a lot of mistrust because of a lack of communication
1244244 thats great that we have a full time police chief but for them to say that it couldnt be done for the past 21 2 years and now all of a sudden we need it right now

1244264 my biggest worry with pietersen is that he gets a bit far above himself and doesnt keep his feet on the ground
1244265 hes got to remember who his friends are if he keeps that in mind he will be all right he has as much talent as anyone that has ever played the game
1244266 we got nobody out in the bullpen just terrible pitches balls flying around everywhere
1244267 we have to have someone step up and make pitches not very much fun

1244271 the discovery of lake deposits with perfectly preserved fossils of mosses diatoms and minute crustacea called ostracods is particularly exciting
1244272 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since they were discovered during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1244273 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1244274 if we can understand how we got into this relatively cold climate phase then that can help predict how global warming might push us back out of this phase

1244289 theres a little bit of that let me show you but its balanced by the fact those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
1244290 anybody whos gone through that been beaten up a little bit theres going to be a confidence factor
1244291 not playing last year was probably one of the hardest things i ever had to go through period
1244292 while last year sucked and going through that was tough i dont feel like they were unfair to me if i look at it like an adult they gave me a fair shake
1244293 to be honest with you i wanted a fresh start somewhere else
1244294 i wanted to get out of this market and start all over
1244295 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging
1244296 you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of look at yourself in the mirror
1244297 in terms of going out there and feeling like i can get the job done i feel i can do that
1244298 in arkansas we had four or five pass protections the whole time i was there
1244299 i come out here you have 10 or 12 if youre a split second late youre going to miss him
1244300 i was just asking gore not to punch me in the face you know how it is we dont fight anymore we sue
1244301 thats how we want him to be at every practice not just because were going to play somebody else
1244302 im not into the whole well when the lights go on they play well thats not my deal
1244303 obviously i wanted to ask him what do you think of the young guy
1244304 and he brought up some good points about his evaluation of practice
1244305 hes got a lot of talent and a lot going through his mind if they just keep it simple he seems to have a real good feel for it i think hes going to do good things
1244306 you can tell from offseason training until now hes getting comfortable with the offense
1244307 jamarcus has this presence when he comes in there its something that you cant teach a swagger its exciting to watch him you can just tell
1244308 i remember coming off the field and our head coach lou saban saying son youre going to get a helluva education tonight and theres not a damn thing i can do about it now

1244330 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1244331 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous
1244332 dont believe that winning is really everything its more important to stand for something if you dont stand for something what do you win
1244333 he is beyond being a motivational speaker but rather spiritual knowledgeable and an action oriented presenter
1244334 will have the page edited and corrected as soon as possible
1244335 this guy pitching tonight milwaukee left hander manny parra is tough on left handers hes tough period hes a good little pitcher a good young pitcher
1244336 bruce is going to bat third most of the time and against some lefties but i thought it would be better to put edwin encarnacion there today especially the way eddie hits left handers
1244337 it depends on how he handles it and i think he can handle it big time
1244338 whether it is now or later you have to find out sometime but we will protect him against some left handers like parra
1244339 mentally its tough to watch tough to sit and not play and not help out
1244340 thats pretty much my speech since ive been getting hurt it hasnt changed
1244341 what they took out of my knee was pretty nasty but they snipped that out and now i have to get the hamstring strengthened and in reasonable shape
1244342 my goal is to come back in about three weeks but in two weeks they will make a decision on whether i will be able to do that
1244343 well see how he comes out of this the next day is always the telling day but i was surprised to hear that he didnt walk anybody and didnt give up any runs while striking six
1244344 tampa bay has couches milwaukee has couches the chicago cubs have a room full of lounger chairs
1244345 does that mean you have to be in first place to have couches if youre in last place you cant have couches
1244346 i didnt ask for it but reds general manager walt jocketty really likes it
1244347 thanks walt when i was a kid my dad had a recliner and as soon as he left the house i ran to that recliner and grabbed all the change
1244348 which way is the wind blowing well it doesnt really matter in this park
1244349 if anybody can do something like that i can dick pole pitching coach said he has been in the game 40 years and never saw anything like it i told him ive been in the game four years and never saw anything like it
1244350 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1244351 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1244352 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1244353 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1244354 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1244355 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1244356 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1244357 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1244358 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1244359 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1244360 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1244361 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1244362 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1244363 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1244364 most of the innings i felt i had to battle quite a bit they put me to the test petty good
1244365 not for me most of the guys who are pretty close to being major league players are here already and have been most of the year it isnt like we have 10 prospects at triple a who are ready to take a job up here
1244366 i always want to win no matter who i put out there
1244367 it has been only a few seasons that i went into september and it didnt mean anything
1244368 in our division a lot can turn around in a hurry
1244369 if you get hot man ive seen it people think im the eternal optimist but i can be that because ive seen that and done that
1244370 you try to finish as high as you can finish
1244371 these are primo times for somebody when you are playing inside your division the last two months as much as we are well it might as well be us
1244372 but you keep fighting and you keep struggling you dont look back you look forward keep the spirits high
1244373 i came in on an off day with one of my buddies and i changed my stance a little bit hitting in the cage messing around i was joking around and i said i was going to try it and it has been working
1244374 its always luck when we pitchers get hits but im feeling good at the plate
1244375 im crouching a little more and widened my stance to see if i could stay back on breaking stuff
1244376 when you are left handed and hit a home run to left field off a left hander that means youre staying on the pitch not pulling off
1244377 dusty has no evidence as to why he shouldnt do that but i know that ill have no problems with lefties soon enough
1244378 you have to respect his decision its logical for right now until i show him otherwise i will its just a matter of time

1244383 we need to dry up the market for these types of events
1244384 it wasnt so much a meeting as an open forum
1244385 theyre making every single play in the field and were making none like today first inning the ball is hit at me and i should at least knock it down and i cant even do that
1244386 as long as they ask permission which they did its fine with me
1244387 a couple of em came in and asked if it was ok and i said yes
1244388 because we overmeet as a society you can talk but you have to follow through in your talking and put it into action
1244389 ive done motivational speaking and the first thing i tell them is i can only motivate you for a little while
1244390 dont let them have a players only meeting because it looks as if youve lost the team i love roger craig but i never believed that if you feel secure in yourself you dont have to worry about that
1244391 i had a meeting friday after ken griffey jr was traded
1244392 after my meetings i always ask if anybody has anything to say and invariably nobody does i hope thats not the case in the players meeting i hope they all have something to say
1244393 we have so many young guys on our team and they need to hear from some of the older players like i used to hear from hank aaron and like when i was with the dodgers they used to hear from davy lopes reggie smith and me
1244394 that was it that was the game thats baseball sometimes if you miss the first inning you miss the whole game
1244395 teams are jumping on us early and we have the miscue dunns error that cost us a couple of runs early
1244396 it was the difference in the ball game and we just have to tighten up the defense
1244397 walks at the wrong time errors a lot of errors both mental errors and physical errors
1244398 and most of the time the other team is scoring first
1244399 so many times the other teams goes through its batting order twice before we go through once that equals their big boys coming to the plate five times instead of four times
1244400 i dont want to run him out there for only four innings on his first start and put my bullpen in jeopardy
1244401 we want him to at least go seven innings or 100 pitches more than likely hell pitch two there
1244402 he threw off the mound and threw pretty good and well find out whats what when we get home
1244403 i was throwing the ball all right but nothing went right but it definitely doesnt help when you walk the leadoff guy
1244404 other than i knew i had been throwing the ball well and getting people out i didnt know how many innings and it wasnt a very good way to end it

1244435 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1244436 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1244437 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something

1244501 this is a road where changes have made it unnecessary
1244502 its time to remove this road from the planned infrastructure and be done with it

1244517 a recent nonpartisan report ranks u s senators in terms of effectiveness where does elizabeth dole rank 93rd senator dole was ranked 93rd in effectiveness only six other senators ranked less effective she cant fix gas prices from 93rd place or create jobs and she sure hasnt fixed immigration from 93rd place elizabeth dole after 40 years in washington not as effective as you might think the democratic senatorial campaign committee is responsible for the content of this advertising
1244518 almost every senator comes to the senate with a pretty impressive resume
1244519 senator dole is a proven effective leader for north carolina while mrs hagan only offers nothing but negative false attacks
1244520 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1244521 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at
1244522 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1244523 i think right now youve got a guy in western pennsylvania saying i am really disgusted right now and im not going to register as a republican anymore but i really dont want this guy obama elected
1244524 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way this administration has been conducting the policies of this country
1244525 the best explanation this may sound strange since i have chosen the political arena as my career but im more comfortable in the presence of 20 people than i am in the presence of 200 people
1244526 that convention is wall to wall people i could see losing four or five days when i could be at home my record will remain intact

1244539 the system builds a 3d model just from a raw collection of photographs
1244540 you are simultaneously adjusting the position of the camera and where those little pieces of images are until everything basically snaps together
1244541 i think the photo sharing websites will be early adopters of this technology
1244542 wherever people share photos instead of just seeing a gallery of unorganised photos now you can pull everyone elses photos together and make a rational sense out of it
1244543 the other obvious application he added would be for tourism and property where a city could provide a virtual tour or a hotel could potential visitors walk through its lobby photosynth

1244568 a novel arsenical has antitumor activity toward as2o3 resistant and mrp1 abcc1 overexpressing cell lines
1244569 this study suggests that darinaparsin may have a broader therapeutic spectrum than inorganic arsenic as it is less affected by the resistance mechanisms of certain cancer cells
1244570 the successful application of a treatment that offers inorganic arsenics efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia to other more common malignancies would be significant i look forward to seeing more data from ongoing clinical and pre clinical studies

1244572 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
1244573 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
1244574 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
1244575 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
1244576 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
1244577 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
1244578 with the special protocol assessment in hand and two positive large phase 3 trials that met their primary and important secondary endpoints the tesamorelin program is steadily progressing towards a nda submission with a targeted market approval by the end of 2009
1244579 at a recent conference organized by the american heart association and the american academy of hiv medicine it was emphasized that hiv positive patients who adhered to their hiv medications had fewer complications than patients who took their antiretroviral regimens intermittently
1244580 since stress related to body image may actually lead patients to discontinue or alter their hiv treatments reducing this stress could be very beneficial
1244581 long term impact of tesamorelin th9507 a growth hormone releasing factor analogue on body image parameters in hiv infected patients with excess abdominal fat
1244582 results from the 26 week confirmatory phase 3 trial of tesamorelin th9507 a growth hormone releasing factor analogue in hiv patients with excess abdominal fat a multi center double blind placebo controlled study with 404 randomized patients
1244583 recent evidence suggests that in many cases tumor cells have already seeded metastatic sites even when the primary tumor is diagnosed at an early stage
1244584 we hope that with additional studies we can begin to discover new ways to therapeutically keep the dormant to active switch in the off position thus limiting the chance that micrometastases become active in later life

1244680 it seems to me that the regulative idea that we heirs of the enlightenment we socratists most frequently use to criticize the conduct of various conversational partners is that of needing education in order to outgrow their primitive fear hatreds and superstitions

1244682 we should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth and to assimilate it from whatever source it comes to us even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples for him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than truth itself it never cheapens or debases him who reaches for it but ennobles and honors him
1244683 we need to see the artifacts and dating evidence to suggest such an occupation in the 1st century a d
1244684 its quite possible that there was a cave with earlier occupation which was later converted to christian use but to make the jump that this was actually used by christians fleeing jerusalem in the 1st century a d seems like a stretch to me
1244685 and even if the cave can be proved to have been in use in the first century a d there needs to be additional evidence that it was used by christians

1244694 i have two young kids and a wife who has supported me the whole time it would be fun to spend time with them
1244695 the coaches tell us be the class that turns this around within ourselves the guys we talk about how we can make an impact or try to make an impact anyway possible so its among us
1244696 i havent talked to howard about this or anything related i have full support of everything hes doing but weve had no contact about this
1244697 was conceived by slade gorton and wally walker it was timed and intended to derail the nbas vote on the pbcs request to locate to oklahoma city and rehabilitate the image of howard schultz who some hold responsible for the sonics potential departure but the nba approved relocation the team has moved and schultzs image depends on more important things
1244698 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1244699 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1244700 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1244701 not to my knowledge we have not had any contact with him
1244702 you need to manage volunteers properly and that takes staff time
1244703 we hear over and over from people who tell us theyll call an organization and say they want to volunteer and they dont get a call back or they make an appointment and the people at the agency forget about it some groups dont treat volunteers well
1244704 buying a home represents a high commitment to the community where you live
1244705 renters are more mobile and have less commitment to the area where theyre living
1244706 a lot of time spent in the car and on the train means you miss a lot of opportunities to volunteer because you cant get home in time
1244707 partially its because everybody wants to be paid for everything they do
1244708 also people work two or three jobs just to survive and they dont have the time or energy to volunteer
1244709 you know one of the things surveys find is that the main issue in getting people to volunteer is whether somebody asks them to volunteer weve got to do a better job of making sure we ask
1244710 you need to manage volunteers properly and that takes staff time

1244714 a lot of time spent in the car and on the train means you miss a lot of opportunities to volunteer because you cant get home in time
1244715 what can i tell you turn communist get colder have a lot more kids
1244716 i went to beijing last year on business and really looked around
1244717 china may have a bigger home field advantage than most have had
1244718 i told everyone to check back early sunday morning to see if we won
1244719 had they lost i dont think they would have wanted to get up and do this
1244720 the first time we played them we couldnt hit at all in the title game we could hit
1244721 the nerves arent as bad and we have that experience
1244722 the obama campaign introduced an initiative that would allow cellphone users to pose the campaign questions using text messages to subscribe to get updates from the campaign users could text message go to the number 62262 which conveniently spells out the candidates last name they could then ask obama anything during this years yearlykos convention the campaign also encouraged people to text obama for information about chicago the senators hometown
1244723 us candidates hit digg fail to get the social news site
1244724 obama was fortunate to be able to grow up seeing america from varied viewpoints

1244727 i think that my value to him my support of him is probably worth more than any check
1244728 i am confident that the air quality will not pose major problems to athletes and visitors here
1244729 it is hourly data and we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may take some action
1244730 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does
1244731 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1244732 the thing i hate is having a runner on third with less than two outs and not bringing him in
1244733 its an easy rbi but i put together some other good at bats
1244734 guys are beginning to pick it up after the break
1244735 we know theyre not going to hand us the division
1244736 all in all it was kind of ugly in the first inning im human i cant go out there and put up zeros inning after inning
1244737 weve said a lot this year that weve got to pitch better
1244738 once that starts happening there are some really good things on the horizon we know we can score we just let people score too many against us
1244739 his stuff was pretty good but maybe it wasnt the command we were used to seeing
1244740 i was trying to find a way to get on base
1244741 they were playing me way back at third base and that gave me the opportunity to get on
1244742 we were fortunate to get as many runs as we did off dan tonight
1244743 it doesnt happen often so when it does you hope you can shut the other team down
1244744 he was all over he was flirting with a lot of trouble every inning and just couldnt get anything going

1244757 a dedicated official together with the necessary support staff be appointed to drive the process that will lead to the adoption of a financially sustainable business plan

1244760 whether they like it or not we will not leave zuma here we will be going to the union buildings with him
1244761 we are in this trouble because of thabo mbeki and his people for that reason mbeki must leave and zuma must be president now
1244762 the solution to this problem is an early election we must vote for zuma
1244763 the umkhonto we sizwe military veterans associations mkmva threat of revolutionary violence should zuma be found guilty of corruption makes his candidacy as president untenable
1244764 zuma must now put the public interest first and withdraw from the presidential race until his trial is resolved

1244771 i was helping at the prisons skills training centre and realised how many of the prisoners i was working with were repeat offenders or people who had been released but were awaiting trial on other charges
1244772 it struck me that if jobs could be found for these people many of them could be led away from a life of crime and jail
1244773 nafcoc also put me in touch with business people who were willing to give ex offenders or parolees a second chance
1244774 i decided on this to provide concerned citizens with a vehicle that proactively fights crime thus making our country safer for all of us it provides an invaluable opportunity for all sectors of society to be involved
1244775 i am in the studio 9 to 5 every day and late at night as well sometimes i love doing it id rather work than watch television i dont really get tired working its the excitement of getting that finished product out
1244776 i decided i like this place so much i moved here and not to cape town
1244777 one day a german tourist walked off the beach for a beer at the backpackers and asked about the studio he bought seven artworks and has one studio in cape town and another in germany and said he is planning to set up an exhibition of my work in germany
1244778 i can do up to six pieces a day they just happen im never sure what story is going to unfold when i combine the pieces that come from all over the place it makes sense later but at the time its quite random
1244779 the most important part of what i do is to take people away from themselves half the fun is trying to find the stuff from antique stores i find these little gems and get so excited i want to just get home and get started
1244780 its like finding lost memories its amazing what people discard i find old photo albums and cant believe people throw the stuff out
1244781 i speak to many of the scientists and they help me a lot with my research the fish as a symbol conveys a worldly interpretation that reflects primordial celestial knowledge
1244782 he made logical and sound decisions the monitoring instructions he gave to the nurses in the ward were appropriate but were not acted upon the fact that those instructions were not acted upon cannot be held to bothas account
1244783 the longer the process went on the less likely it became that she would survive we cannot say for certain when she reached that point
1244784 the most likely reason for her death is bleeding but other possibilities cannot be excluded
1244785 cosatu will be mobilising its two million members and civil society formations in a national stayaway on the issue of the electricity crisis
1244786 we will be calling for maphazi and manager graham richards to step down immediately
1244787 we will also be demanding a review of the electricity and municipal services tariffs which have increased by 30 per cent the poor cant afford these
1244788 both government and big business must intervene in food prices including fuel
1244789 we fought for nationalisation of natural resources all this can be addressed if government is willing to intervene
1244790 they live a luxurious life when this class wants to increase food prices it maximises its profits while worsening already skewed inequalities whose victims are working class families and the poor that are without jobs

1244794 project golf 2014 focuses on the introduction of golf as well as career opportunities in the business of golf
1244795 the first impression of project golf 2014 is that of making a difference in the lives of all children who participate
1244796 it is therefore imperative that we duplicate and expand the programme to other provinces

1244805 it the decision to prosecute is merely a decision to trigger a hearing

1244807 i dont see the ambiguity and i dont see the uncertainty
1244808 i can look at anybodys personal details if i want to because all i need is an e mail address and date of birth which i can get on facebook
1244809 if i look on facebook to see who is at my university their date of birth is there and most of the time they use their varsity e mails which have their student numbers

1244850 people are paying more attention to the size tag than the price tag and feeling down when they cant fit their standard size
1244851 people should aim for the perfect fit not the perfect size and work with any outfit to ensure it enhances their individual body shape
1244852 however having an accurate sizing standard based on scientific data will allow designers to have consistent sizes and ensure the consumer feels good about their fashion experience

1244857 she made her choice and that was up to her
1244858 were here to represent our country we have a nice rivalry with russia with or without her its always been a battle whether shes here or not well always bring our best
1244859 its not an issue anymore were playing against russia now and its 12 people
1244860 anyone who puts that uniform on is our opposition there is no individual that we look at or highlight
1244861 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1244862 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1244863 my parents wouldnt let me play because i was a little bigger when i was growing up they thought id be playing with guys three years older than me and getting hurt they didnt want to risk it
1244864 my grandfather refereed in the nfl for over 30 years and my uncle played for the university of miami
1244865 i had a great time there for five year and won a national championship
1244866 once i got to playing football i was under the realization that i was always the smallest guy on the offensive line
1244867 my first year starting in college i weighed 265 pounds and i was definitely the lightest guy on the line
1244868 it just goes to show you that its as much up here as anything
1244869 chris isnt the biggest guy but hes definitely not small either
1244870 it all starts with what the center tells the line to do
1244871 they have to trust him and what he sees initially
1244872 im happy to have him here an extra buddy weve got such a great nucleus of guys on the team hes a great addition
1244873 im looking to help them out with the zone running scheme
1244874 so far were having fun with it were going to do some big things this season i cant wait to get to regular season games
1244875 not making the world team last year was one pitfall and a huge disappointment
1244876 but after everything that i went through i still consider that year to be a victory
1244877 my main goal is to win the 400 meters in beijing i would love to be part of the 4x400 and 4x100 but after last season im just focused on my main goal which is to be an individual gold medalist
1244878 i remember going out for the track team when i was 9 years old and being the champion girl from my class
1244879 thats where my roots are the speed is just in jamaica
1244880 sanya is similar now this season to where she was in 2006 before the behcets
1244881 it blows my mind to think of what she was able to accomplish with all of the physical problems she had a year ago and now we havent missed any training her medication is working and i think shes back on track to where she wants to go
1244882 olympic relay gold medalist darold williamson said i was the first female athlete that coach hart has really opened up to i guess none of the other girls had taken the time to become a friend to him as well as an athlete i think since we have such a great relationship he invests more time in me and it shows on the track
1244883 the medication ive been taking since the new year has made a world of difference i havent had a flare up since jan 1 which i think is a miracle
1244884 we know that in order to win well have to run the ball successfully
1244885 one of our biggest goals is to find players who can fill that role for us
1244886 its early but i feel confident that we can find five players who can come in and jell as a unit the quicker they are able to mesh the better our offense is going to be
1244887 he can do it all ive been around some good quarterbacks in my time as a coach and bobby is definitely among them
1244888 the one thing ive told him is not to put pressure on himself his job isnt about throwing for 300 yards i told him the only stat he has to worry about is adding to the w column everyone knows he has a rocket arm everyone knows he has 4 5 speed this is about him being the leader of this team
1244889 ive rehearsed being in this position for the last 17 years
1244890 i felt like ive been here before and while its exciting i dont have time to flap my wings theres a lot of work to do to me its just another august morning but with a more familiar color
1244891 the last two years have been hard i was feeling so much pain this is the first time in two years i can honestly say im just playing and not worrying about my knee
1244892 could start for probably any other team in the nfl
1244893 i know theres a strong possibility that i might not make this team
1244894 for individual goals it stinks but as a guy who wants to see the texans do good thats a good thing
1244895 once you get to the point where you feel like if you dont make the team your life ends
1244896 in philly i was oblivious you never heard from the texans you never saw their games on tv you knew they were a young struggling team what kubiak and them have done the last two years is pretty amazing its a playoff type atmosphere we work hard we have defined leaders
1244897 one thing about philly during training camp we knew good guys good players were going to get cut
1244898 now were to that point where were a playoff type team were going to have guys picked up by other teams maybe even start for other teams who wont make this team
1244899 coming from nigeria they thought football was a brutal sport
1244900 they didnt like the fact that it took away from my study time because both of my parents are all about education its funny my sophomore year at san antonios marshall high i got my first letter from northwestern university and then my parents realized you can get a full scholarship the next game my dad was there cheering like any other parent
1244901 if i dont make the team ive already got my season tickets
1244902 i am going to be up there screaming at earl cochran to make a play
1244903 let me be the first one to say that i put them in a tough position as a coach because im saying you be aggressive you knock the heck out of people but stay off the ground
1244904 thats hard to do its hard to play this game when youre being very aggressive and keeping people up but thats what we have to do as a team
1244905 youve got to be able to play physical play nasty but youve got to understand the team is no 1 you cant hurt your team
1244906 i remember when i was young i was the first one to start a fight just to prove that a rice guy wasnt too soft at the same time it is ok to fight out here but dont take that on sunday because you will get ejected get fined and you will probably get cut if you do it too many times
1244907 i think were very fortunate with andre but i think were going to take the cautious approach were going to make sure we get him 120 percent back before he comes back out here well try to keep his condition level up but i think were very fortunate that it wasnt worse
1244908 i think we got through clean well see how he reacts im hoping everything is ok this week
1244909 you cant go out here and all of a sudden go miss eight to 10 days as a back were going to give him a couple days here and see if we can get him back on the field he tells us this has happened before and he was back within a couple days were going to trust him on that and see if we can get him back out here
1244910 if we can go then we will go outside if we cant go and its safe to stay here then obviously well go in the practice bubble
1244911 the thing weve been excited about is that hes maintained some weight he hasnt been able to maintain in the past he plays everywhere that gives him an added lift as far as making this football team he hasnt missed a day so i think hes a better player than he was last year
1244912 hes been a pleasant surprise because we were concerned about whether hed be a two a day full time guy and theres not been a problem
1244913 there are no concerns about fred weary as a player or person
1244914 im concerned hes behind in our new system the hamstring has been the problem not the work he had done before
1244915 hopefully we can make up some ground this week and he can compete before this camp is done
1244916 it disappoints me to be in a position the night before the event when our teams should be celebrating the fact that theyve beaten four very good mexican teams and playing each other of having to have a media call about in the words of some it might have been the union that it is now just an exhibition
1244917 we feel our rights according to the cba have been violated
1244918 we feel we needed a bigger voice we wanted to show that were united as players
1244919 were going out there to win a championship and secure a berth in next years superliga
1244920 i just want to say im happy two mls teams reached the final
1244921 it would be a real highlight for us to be superliga champions
1244922 we wanted to take care of business and build on our momentum going into todays game
1244923 may joy and good fellowship reign and in this manner may the olympic torch pursue its way through ages increasing friendly understanding among nations for the good of a humanity always more enthusiastic more courageous and more pure
1244924 it was a little sore on the outside of the ankle but i was able to run a little better than i was when i pinch hit
1244925 if needed in an emergency i think i could play i just told labossiere the head athletic trainer it was sore on the outside and he said thats a good thing
1244926 he thought it was more straight ahead on my ankle instead of my outside when i was running thats how i felt
1244927 i had hoped hed be back but hes not there yet
1244928 we had hoped on that friday that hed actually get out to play and he just didnt feel 100 percent so well keep going day by day with him
1244929 thats the plant foot for him when he hits its the front foot so thats the one you plant and you hit off of that front side a little bit and then thats your first step that right ankle when you steal base so its a little bit difficult i know you got to be close to 100 percent hopefully hell get that way before this road trip is over for sure in the next two or three days we can run him out there
1244930 i just got a bruised thigh a deep thigh bruise or whatever its just a football injury
1244931 id have to move hunter to center if something happened
1244932 you can go with lance in right or newhan or go with ty those are the three options we have i would be ok with one of those guys going out there
1244933 it kind of limits me sometimes defensively because i cant make a defensive move maybe in the late innings with lee
1244934 although carlos has played awfully well i mean he really has it seems like hes been much more aggressive in the outfield playing that wall and digging balls out of that corner hes done a real good job
1244935 if it doesnt get any better here pretty soon yeah well have to do something
1244936 because it does kind of limit you what you can do i was almost the other day tempted to use newhan hes played a little bit in the outfield it even crossed my mind to use lance
1244937 it would be a little bit unfair to put him out there after not playing all year in the outfield i even thought about ty a couple of times because tys played left and right heck he hasnt played the outfield this year it ties your hands up a little bit so hopefully the next two or three days hell be fine
1244938 sometimes you have this feeling that a matchup kind of suits one or the other a little bit
1244939 my plan had been to hit blum because hes so good against this guy dempster but ty swung it so good yesterday this things kind of bases a little bit on merit on our guys swinging so i got to get him an opportunity to swing
1244940 an unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land
1244941 has done an outstanding job making a square peg fit into a round hole
1244942 ill suited for the task of regulating global greenhouse gases
1244943 based on the analyses to date pursuing this course of action would take decades and inevitably result in a very complicated and likely convoluted set of regulations if our nation is truly serious about regulating greenhouse gases the clean air act is the wrong tool for the job
1244944 epa is publishing this notice today because it is impossible to simultaneously address all the agencies issues and respond to our legal obligations in a timely manner
1244945 the bush administration decision today to effectively reject regulation of global warming pollution under the clean air act creates a clear and present danger to the american people
1244946 despite the supreme courts finding that epa was ducking its responsibility under the law to control global warming emissions the bush administration continues to block all action
1244947 the administration is fiddling while the planet melts if these delays drag on we will go back to court to force real action

1244956 society has no right to be unjust to a single one of its members the whole society minus one is not authorised to obstruct the latter in his opinions nor in those actions which are not harmful in the use of his property or the exercise of his labour save in those cases where that use or that exercise would obstruct another individual possessing the same rights

1244958 a leftist idea can be recognized by three earmarks it will be

1244960 i could tolerate leftists if they had any coherent ideas for a better way to do things but they dont they cling stubbornly to failed brain fart dreams that have been attempted over and over again with disastrous results but they never learn when better ideas come along they simply screech and holler at them then fling feces like the monkeys they are
1244961 extremism in defense of liberty is no vice moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
1244962 i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
1244963 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

1244965 it disappoints me to be in a position the night before the event when our teams should be celebrating the fact that theyve beaten four very good mexican teams and playing each other of having to have a media call about in the words of some it might have been the union that it is now just an exhibition
1244966 we feel our rights according to the cba have been violated
1244967 we feel we needed a bigger voice we wanted to show that were united as players
1244968 were going out there to win a championship and secure a berth in next years superliga
1244969 i just want to say im happy two mls teams reached the final
1244970 it would be a real highlight for us to be superliga champions

1244989 the proposed legislation will not only hinder free speech by korean netizens but seems to be aimed at controlling the public opinion of internet news media
1244990 such measures would not help to promote the democratic development of the korean press and could end up turning back the internet clock in korea
1244991 each side is asking for guarantees still things are not solved
1244992 they told her that the best thing she could do for al qaeda was to start popping out little jihadists
1244993 she was furious she knows more about this stuff than pretty much anyone in the organization
1244994 in the area where she was sequestered they put their weapons down while trying to talk to her and she seized a weapon and began to shoot
1244995 our officer returned fire she was shot in the stomach but continued to struggle
1244996 we thought she was dead until her brother in houston got a visit from the fbi the other day and said she is alive

1244999 unum one of the nations leading disability insurers has long had a reputation for unfairly denying and delaying claims unums claims handling abuses have consistently been the subject of regulator and media investigations
1245000 in california where nearly one in every four claims for long term care insurance was denied the california department of insurance launched an investigation into unum
1245001 in 2005 unum agreed to a settlement with insurance commissioners from 48 states over their claims handling practices under the agreement the company agreed to reopen more than 200 000 cases and pay 15 million
1245002 we were in a similar situation in 1991 we went up to lowell and we drew the host team on a friday night and we went in with the attitude that we were fortunate that we got the host team
1245003 we thought things were going to be a cake walk and we lost that game lowell went on to win the state championship that year and we were home in two games
1245004 we were 27 3 or something like that in 91 and it can happen four years ago we went down to milford on the third day and milford was the host team its not unheard of for the host team to go on a run and send a few people home you have to be ready to play regardless of record our ultimate goal is to be playing on saturday game 1 is against chicopee and hopefully well be around for the next day
1245005 they dont have much to lose so theyll put it all on the table against us
1245006 i dont want to worry about the other teams we are playing everyone up there is talented
1245007 chicopee certainly has their own advantages they are playing on their home field im sure theres going to be a ton people there tonight they are familiar with their park theyve been sitting around for two to three weeks waiting for this game
1245008 a little bit but it was probably going to happen sometime its hard to run the table and go undefeated
1245009 theres still going to be pressure on us since people know we are one of the top teams
1245010 right now im going to think tuesday because thats our first game but if he tells me otherwise im going to do what he says hes the boss
1245011 it puts you at a distinct advantage if you win the first two unless you get rained out and have to play at 11 a m the next day
1245012 this is the beginning of a big change in mobile computing
1245013 we would have gotten drowned out with all the noise
1245014 we just thought a boom was going to happen and it really didnt
1245015 we didnt feel it was gaining the traction that we wanted it to
1245016 quite frankly its a bit of a trophy we simply have to get the lowest borrowing rate we can for the town and the taxpayers
1245017 compared to most other communities in massachusetts i think this is a place where you can see forward progress you can see the potential for progress and the management system in place to get there
1245018 so we need you to remember tonight about all the good news we bring you because during the budget season its not all good news

1245028 what about those who say developers want to build parking
1245029 this project was originally planned as a condo thus the higher parking ratio owners typically have more cars than renters and perceive parking as beneficial to resale value a project originally planned as apartments would have had a lower parking ratio not to mention smaller units and lower grade finishes
1245030 social engineering is a concept in political science that refers to efforts to influence popular attitudes and social behavior on a large scale whether by governments or private groups

1245035 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1245036 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1245037 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1245038 ive talked to my neighbors and worked things out i really just thought this would be a funny thing to do
1245039 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1245040 here is a comparison of my current super vanguard and sunsuper fees for a fund of fund
1245041 with the great tradition of the lenfant plan revolving around walkability and streetcars
1245042 if we fail with parking maximums and undersupply parking the solution is to raise prices and build more
1245043 if we fail with miimums and overbuild there is greater risk and financial stress for those willing to invest in dc
1245044 why throw more money into useless holes in the ground
1245045 see what happens when you dont require any minimum parking
1245046 we cant convert a parking space into another convenient use
1245047 it cant be a condo it cant even be a doghouse if we guess wrong or force more parking than might be necessary were stuck with it for a very long time
1245048 this is not an insigificant concern but neither is it an unsolvable one
1245049 people on capitol hill dont want to abandon their ability to have a car
1245050 the cost of parking is very high and not usually recovered
1245051 finally addressing the balance of people who want to live in a city with cars and people who do not
1245052 if you become a member we will be sharing a car
1245053 doesnt two spaces per classroom seem kind of low what do you do fight in the schoolyard
1245054 what could be more important than training young people in the use of bicycles
1245055 trying to make life better for the other 47 is anathema to clark who called it
1245056 this particular repeal is not regulating anything new theyre requiring them not to put in parking rather theyre doing the exact opposite letting the developer look at the market and do a cost analysis of digging down it gives the developer savings and the architect more freedom
1245057 lets drop a parking garage wherever our variable rate parking meters have the lowest empty rate
1245058 we cant convert a parking space into another convenient use
1245059 the times our 2 hour residential parking is in effect makes no sense the 2 hour restriction should be in the evenings and not during the day when there is soooo much parking available
1245060 you only think that because the 2 hour restriction solved what was a very real problem before we implemented it before that restriction there was no parking available during the day commuters would drive in from the suburbs and park their cars in our neighborhood streets and then walk or bus to their jobs
1245061 why was it dont back then and do those conditions still exist
1245062 i know better whats best for you than you know and you will do as i say
1245063 exactly how do you expect to sustain that high price for permit or prohibition when there are many more condominiums and there isnt enough parking and the residents of those buildings are dc voters
1245064 you know what i dont feel bad for you at all if you want a guaranteed spot buy one why should we subsidize your habits the building i live in which has too many spots do to parking minimums offers spots for sale buy one
1245065 no one will be prevented from building parking rather the developers will have the opportunity to build what they feel are the correct number of spots
1245066 lance do all of those garages in georgetown have only the very minimum required number of spaces posted by david alpert on aug 4 2008 11 52 am
1245067 the towns of middleborough ipswich salem and gloucester have abolished parking minimums for residences or other uses in certain locations
1245068 it is the intention of this ordinance that all new structures and new building and land uses be provided with sufficient off street parking spaces to meet the needs of persons making use of such structures and land uses
1245069 dont you think dupont or adams morgan wish they wouldve put in parking 50 years ago
1245070 the change would destabilize the very rowhouse neighborhoods you claim to find attractive
1245071 lance you argue that builders will not build parking and fool people into living into parking less buildings and then two paragraphs later argue that nobody will move into buildings without parking
1245072 you just illustrated the lack of knowledge and self centric thinking upon which this misguided attempt to change the very successful parking minimums legislation is based
1245073 small steps are what is required rather than one all encompassing step that does everything all at once
1245074 newsflash a lot more of you do not require a car than youre willing to admit and for those that do you do not require a friggin truck to taxi your kids around nor so many vehicles per household
1245075 those who can afford to do so and pay whatever it costs to drive park where they need to
1245076 it doesnt make sense to put in underground parking my market cant afford it and there is plenty of on street parking for nearly free
1245077 should be enough to allow for people in houses without rear alley access to rent a spot on their street
1245078 vary by hour and location to better match parking availability and demand
1245079 the elasticity of transit use with respect to transit service frequency called a headway elasticity averages 0 5

1245081 lifted up was he to die it is finished was his cry now in heaven exalted high alleluia what a saviour
1245082 up from the grave he arose with a mighty triumph oer his foes he arose a victor from the dark domain and he lives for ever with his saints to reign he arose he arose hallelujah christ arose
1245083 jesus loves me he who died heavens gate to open wide he will wash away my sin let his little child come in
1245084 now i belong to jesus jesus belongs to me not for the years of time alone but for eternity
1245085 lord take my life and make it wholly thine fill my poor heart with thy great love divine strengthened by the lord we pray for the advance of the gospel in all the earth
1245086 if you have this authority from god show us a miracle to prove it
1245087 destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
1245088 it has taken forty six years to build this temple and will you raise it up in three days
1245089 when therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had spoken
1245090 the repeated animal sacrificial offerings of judaism would would be replaced by the one and once for all offering of himself by jesus christ the son of god in death and resurrection
1245091 behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
1245092 god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ
1245093 the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are gods children
1245094 the manner how the divine testimony is manifested to the heart i do not take upon me to explain such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me i cannot attain unto it the wind bloweth and i hear the sound thereof but i cannot tell how it cometh or whither it goeth as no one knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man that is in him so the manner of the things of god knoweth no one save the spirit of god but the fact we know namely that the spirit of god does give a believer such a testimony of his adoption
1245095 the spirit of god does give a believer such a testimony of his adoption
1245096 i know not how the spirit moves convincing men of sin revealing jesus through the word creating faith in him but i know whom i have believed and i am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
1245097 has stressed the centrality and the kerygmatic character of the biblical writings the radical discontinuity between god and human nature and has made much of the concepts of crisis judgment and grace
1245098 tried to avoid the excesses into which the older liberalism fell but their critics frequently bring against them the criticisms which were brought against their theological predecessors in the second decade of the twentieth century
1245099 sadly such theologians as barth bultmann and tillich have been in danger of disengaging the gospel from history in all its ambiguity and messiness
1245100 t he liberal roots of tillichs theology are very evident
1245101 it is when we look at jesus christ that we know decisively that gods deity does not exclude but includes his
1245102 the avowed enemy of all objectivism rationalization uf truth into a system of idea
1245103 his emphasis on subjectivity was never intended to mean the abrogation of objectivity
1245104 that truth is subjectivity kierkegaard does not mean that the object of faith is to be confounded with faith nor does it mean the knowing subject construes the object out of or discovers the truth in his own subjectivity
1245105 feeling for the complete reality of the individual existing human being
1245106 kierkegaard affirms that reality is a system for god p
1245107 however problematic he kierkegaaard may find theological claims his affinities lie with the eschatological verificationists rather than with the non cognitvists
1245108 the foolishness and weakness of god in 1 corinthian 1 and a positing of absurdity as the essential content of faith he points out that kierkegaard never adopted the latter position
1245109 profound conflict between the gospel and the prevailing world view
1245110 thus exiling itself from a necessary area of theological truth by restricting truth to personal experience
1245111 i f bultmann is taken seriously the act of god becomes a sheer event lacking all colour character and content a sheer irrelevance
1245112 t his dominant trend anti metaphysical tendency in bultmanns thought inevitably carries with it the implication that over against man there is nothing but a bare beyond
1245113 these are written that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you may have life in his name
1245114 the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
1245115 i tell you i shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it with you in my fathers kingdom
1245116 i give them eternal life and they shall never perish and no one shall snatch them out of my hand
1245117 this is my blood of the new covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
1245118 do not get drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit
1245119 he came down to earth from heaven who is god and lord of all
1245120 who came down from heaven to earth jesus christ our saviour
1245121 who is he in yonder stall at whose feet the shepherds fall tis the lord o wondrous story tis the lord the king of glory
1245122 the son of god loved me and gave himself for me
1245123 my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my saviour
1245124 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased
1245125 glorifying and praising god for all that we have heard
1245126 new clean electric technology that will take 10 years to perfect
1245127 to start with the u s government should lead the way by requiring that a growing percentage of new cars be built with dual fuel capability these dual fuel cars would have both an electric engine and an auxiliary gasoline engine to augment it
1245128 a dryer outlet will give most of a charge in an hour or a full charge in less than 3 hours with a 110 volt outlet its still easily charged overnight with a 200 amp off board charger the tango can be charged to 80 in about 10 minutes
1245129 if it werent about 150 200 times as pricey to park in a garage fewer people would park on the street but more importantly some of those people wouldnt own cars at all
1245130 the 60 000 figure was given to me by a developer

1245132 theyre nominating for this william tabler guy who the heck is that
1245133 largely derivative of some of the better examples we have in town
1245134 is of the category of the recent buildings weve so designated
1245135 when we build new residential buildings with required minimum parking and often lots of it those new residents are more likely to drive out to prince georges plaza than to visit a nearby establishment on rhode island
1245136 for highland park you say that only 5 of the residents are paying for a space but you havent said whether some of the residents of the building might own vehicles that they park on the street in order to save the rent on the spaces
1245137 the problem is that way of life is quickly becoming unsustainable anyway due to the rapidly increasing price of the energy it requires

1245155 yet we remain either unaware of or unable to look at our own history and acknowledge the painful wounds of ethnocide and genocide right here in minnesota we have a very hard time acknowledging that the pain remains and that it has affected much of our history thru to the present day
1245156 bear witness to the tragic side of minnesota statehood in 1858 and acknowledge the pain loss and suffering of the native american culture in minnesota
1245157 last week thomas dahlheimer rum river name change movement had a guest column in the winona daily news titled state looks to settle up with the past
1245158 and last december louis stanley schoen a consultant and trainer on racial justice in the episcopal church authored a commentary in the star tribune titled we must talk about race despite the difficult emotions it stirs
1245159 how might serious healing racial dialogue occur a series of thoughtful sensitive commentary in news media might be a starter sermons and study groups on race in churches would help as would discussions in all kinds of community groups official public bodies must get engaged what if a public commission were to begin to examine the american and european history of white supremacy and here how that doctrine shaped the formation of minnesota and its public and private institutions what if such a commission learned how to offer leadership and resources to dismantle this evil doctrine
1245160 the results could be transforming for us and for all the world what a magnificent legacy this might be to our celebration of minnesotas sesquicentennial
1245161 it seems to me that it would be most meaningful for each state to debate the need for its own truth and reconciliation commission and then to fund it
1245162 when minnesotans become aware of or able to look at their own history and acknowledge the painful wounds of ethnocide and genocide right in their own state they will be inspired to go through a radical social political and religious transformation
1245163 a peaceful cultural revolution will occur and minnesotans will be changed for the better and this will help to heal the dakota oyates painful wounds caused by ethnocide and genocide
1245164 leonard wabasha a hereditary chief of the dakota and director of the shakopee mdewakanton sioux dakota community cultural resource department invited me to address the dakota tribal leaders and government officials during the may 16 reconciliatory ceremony in winona
1245165 during the reconciliatory ceremony i spoke about the 15th century papal bull inter caetera a papal bull that was primarily responsible for minnesotas ethnocide and genocide against the dakota oyate
1245166 a movement to revoke the papal bull has been ongoing for a number of years it was initiated by the indigenous law institute in 1992 at the parliament of world religions in 1994 over 60 indigenous delegates drafted a declaration of vision
1245167 it reads in part we call upon the people of conscience in the roman catholic hierarchy to persuade pope john ii to formally revoke the inter caetera bull of may 4 1493 which will restore our fundamental human rights

1245186 the sort of artist who survives at the long tail is the sort who would be happy doing nothing else who willingly sacrifices security and comfort for the chance to communicate something meaningful hoping to catch the attention of those few in the world who seek what they also find meaningful its a somewhat solitary existence a bit like a lighthouse keeper throwing a beam out into the darkness in faith that this action might help someone unseen
1245187 one can see foreshadowing of this effect in chris andersons writing for all his hyping of the long tail he sees far more concerned with creating the structures and situations in which long tails can occur than he is concerned with what things might actually be like inside those long tails the owners of the myspaces and flickrs and the producers of video editing softwares are getting rich by enabling an unprecedented amount of people to make and distribute their own content and way off at the edge of these systems are a few alpha users who also may be getting rich or at least famous to their peers by making some of that content they arent in the long tail though they are in privileged head those in the tail might have a little fun but they get neither the audience nor financial rewards that demarcate success in this 21st century culture

1245253 rather than producing his own artwork he considered it more relevant to create a collective interest in art
1245254 peterlee was still only a new town at the time having been built in the 1940s and 50s and he wanted to address this issue
1245255 his aim was to show that the history and heritage of peterlee was rooted in the villages around it hence a picture archive
1245256 local people were invited to bring along their photos to provide a statement of life from world war one
1245257 these were then rephotographed and mounted to become part of the archive and have not really been seen in public since
1245258 pop porter and his team finished their work under the auspices of the new easington district council creating the present archive
1245259 but the second and third parts which involved the publication of a history of the corporation and provided a forum for local people were never completed
1245260 it includes scenes featuring the humble origins of the district from agriculture to the creation of the coal industry
1245261 but it also includes pictures of the people who gave the villages their own unique character as well as family and street scenes
1245262 the recordings include 40 or 50 tapes about incidents like colliery disasters as well as tales of day to day life
1245263 the exhibition highlights the way in which the recently acquired gilman collection meshes perfectly with the museums existing collection to create deep rich holdings of work by many of the most important masters of the first century of photography
1245264 there are of course many other individual masterpieces in the collection by a host of photographers but this exhibition allows us to sense the full achievement of some of the mediums greatest artists

1245269 i think that images used in publications especially news media outlets should have some sort of symbol sign or comment notifying the viewer that the images have been manipulated if that is the case once we are open and honest about which images are manipulated and the term photo illustration is common practice then there will be less incentive for the photojournalist to be deceptive
1245270 photo illustration along with other terms is meaningless in my opinion because the reading viewing public doesnt have a clue what it means its a shorthand way of saying this photo is a lie but we want you to believe it so we put a disclaimer usually in tiny type to make ourselves feel ethical hooey
1245271 i think that the term photo illustration would act as an excuse for photojournalists to manipulate more i really dont think that words will deter photographers from going astray
1245272 we have always been able to alter images it has been happening since photography was invented it is only since the advent of photoshop that we have had this fundamentalist attitude about changing photographs
1245273 we are aware that one of image keyworders greatest strengths is its controlled vocabulary
1245274 we have a team of people who are working to expand and enrich the thesaurus but users occasionally still find a gap in our coverage especially if the terms they wish to add are specialised with our new suggest function they can send their suggestions directly to our team for review
1245275 israel and the clash of civilisations iraq iran and the plan to remake the middle east
1245276 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
1245277 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
1245278 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
1245279 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
1245280 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
1245281 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
1245282 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
1245283 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
1245284 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
1245285 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

1245296 it was obvious that edsys it spent a lot of time thinking about the configuration of their system and how to choose the right components to produce an efficient balance of pc power savings and performance the team that put the system together deserves a huge pat on the back as the understanding of power saving technologies both software and hardware really shined in the submission
1245297 edsys it is also working toward iso14001 environmental management standard compliance which guides them to continually monitor and improve the effects of their company and products have on the environment in addition edsys it has undertaken an initiative to offset carbon emissions for the system they ship whereby the company will plant two native trees for each system they sell

1245307 creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way
1245308 in many companies and sectors pay arrangements are still covered by the current agreement if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1245309 the collapse of the pay talks further dispels the myth of s supposed competence on the economy the government found it easy to broker a deal between unions and employers when they could pay for it through the proceeds of a debt fuelled boom and explosion in public spending
1245310 now that the government is facing a tougher economic climate its entire economic policy is unravelling with unemployment rising house prices falling business and consumer confidence plummeting and nothing on offer from the government to tackle any of the problems facing the economy
1245311 for the avoidance of doubt about what trade unions were prepared to contemplate in an national agreement we were prepared to accept that it would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid

1245322 theyre now becoming quite dependent on the u s marketplace
1245323 these new players are an extension of a well established trend and an important aspect of our economy
1245324 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1245325 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at
1245326 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break

1245379 if the efficacy is at that level or higher intervention would be cost effective in very high risk populations
1245380 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
1245381 instead we should look ahead to consider all the possible outcomes of the trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and as safely as possible if it is proven effective
1245382 i havent seen such blatant criminal activity since the 70s
1245383 they yell at me through the intercom when i light my cigarette in the doorway yet they fail to notice when a 12 year old girl is dragged kicking and screaming into a van by four men dressed like clowns
1245384 the residents have an over active imagination beatings muggings kidnappings pish posh
1245385 at the moment people are taking the view that the glass is half empty rather than half full
1245386 rather than looking at the positive side that weaker commodities take the pressure off inflation people are seeing it as a product of slower growth
1245387 juan gomez underwent an mri scan in the afternoon monday and the result shows the tear of the external meniscus of his left knee
1245388 his participation in the test against south africa is ruled out
1245389 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1245390 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1245391 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1245392 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1245393 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1245394 that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1245395 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
1245396 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
1245397 there is a rule in the french competition that a player can finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
1245398 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract
1245399 willem took a fall on his knee and the impact caused damage to his hip
1245400 willem de waal is in quite a bit of pain and he cant even stand on his leg were just hoping that he wont require surgery
1245401 dylan des fountain suffered a toe injury and he is on crutches
1245402 deon fourie has a badly swollen lip after stitches for an injury he picked up against the lions theres quite a bit of damage on his face
1245403 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1245404 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1245405 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1245406 sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying
1245407 this one has been mooted before we have been over some of these ideas over the last few weeks
1245408 there is nothing dead in the water at the moment because reviews are taking place over the next 12 months and we are happy for all options to be included happy for any suggestions to come forward from any people whether it is players sponsors provincial unions or franchises
1245409 the understanding that i was briefed on this groups plans is incorrect
1245410 they reeked of old spice and drank pbr so i thought they were williamsburg transplants
1245411 but then i saw them moshing in the oval the other night and puking in the grass i mean even hipsters cant find irony in the dead kennedys so i knew something was up
1245412 they are planting pot behind those ugly bushes planted in cornrows on first avenue
1245413 the plants are over four feet tall thanks to the new sprinklers its shameful
1245414 they looked cool i thought stuyvesant town wanted young cool people
1245415 we dont consider things like drugs crime or old spice funny entertaining or helpful for our residents
1245416 the other day when i said the past few months have been our biggest leasing months so far i meant it
1245417 we unloaded about six apartments to thirty five college kids last month thats not too bad considering that manhattan is real estate poison right now
1245418 at first it was just mildly annoying and we assumed it was coming from the escort service run out of our neighbors apartment
1245419 then the noise became unbearable its impossible to sleep and the other night i walked into the kitchen and all of my pots and pans were stuck to the ceiling because of some magnetic force field
1245420 its no wonder they dont let us on the roofs anymore look what theyve been hiding
1245421 i was on my cell phone the other day making plans to join a friend while she went apartment hunting
1245422 the next day i got an eviction notice because of my new primary residence theyre insane
1245423 companies like tishman speyer will do whatever they can to make a profit even at the expense of the health and well being of their residents cell towers on the roofs of residential properties are illegal because we dont yet know the health and environmental impact they have
1245424 cell phones im still trying to figure out why my telegraph stopped working quit bugging me
1245425 i called the management office when i noticed my rent bill hadnt arrived yet
1245426 they put me on hold for twenty minutes and then some indian lady came on the line and was asking me if my day was pleasant and if my bill was satisfactory well no
1245427 it was so hard to hear him over the crackling line and i had to constantly repeat myself it was like talking to a three year old
1245428 maybe if they spent less time being racist and more time paying their bills they wouldnt have so many problems
1245429 bring the iphone into the same league as the nintendo ds and sony psp
1245430 according to the new york times article t s lost millions in dollars of revenue due to
1245431 my lease states that i would have a pressure wall nowhere does it say that i would have to rummage through dumpsters for drywall and build it myself there was chinese food all over it
1245432 dear tenants we are sorry to inform you that residents must remove the new walls they recently constructed it seems that not all residents properly cleaned their materials resulting in a huge increase in the volume of calls requesting extermination services a management representative along with a tri line construction crew have begun inspecting apartments affected by the pressure wall situation and started removing your homemade walls this email hopes to clarify any misunderstandings that may have arisen when tenants have come home to semi demolished apartments we appreciate your cooperation and thank you again for living luxuriously in stuyvesant town tishman speyer
1245433 i was virtually walking my cyber daughter to the holographic school bus one morning and rob speyer and a scantily clad man stopped us and asked my daughter to light their crack pipe
1245434 i can assure you that mr speyer doesnt know how to use his cell phone let alone a fancy computer
1245435 got tangled up with a receiver during a play and twisted his leg awkwardly
1245436 every day is going to be different depending on the feel of each individual some days he will feel a little better than me and the majority of the days i will feel a little better than him
1245437 i think im the best he thinks hes the best so that will make us better i know on sunday my job will be a whole lot easier
1245438 it helps me a lot t o is a world class athlete im enjoying myself and im getting better every day
1245439 call me pac man dont call me pac man please call me pac man
1245440 its the best job in the ioc because you have the honour to represent the voice of the athlete i think frankie will take the athletes commission to the next level hes a perfect fit for the role
1245441 the discovery of lake deposits with perfectly preserved fossils of mosses diatoms and minute crustacea called ostracods is particularly exciting
1245442 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since they were discovered during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1245443 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past
1245444 the income tax department has seized all his property and auctioned it the profits made from the auction were paid in taxes he has absolutely no income and is left with nothing
1245445 his wife is ill and doesnt even have money to buy medicines she is staying with relatives
1245446 the income tax department had seized all his bank balances and fixed deposits they auctioned his properties in bangalore and belgaum
1245447 his properties in mumbai which include some lodges have also been seized but havent yet been auctioned
1245448 his brother had no money to travel back to belgaum from bangalore i gave him rs 600 for his ticket his mother fell ill and died without proper medication it was tragic
1245449 instead of calculating just the profit made from sales it officials have included his cost and the profit in their calculations
1245450 there were a few other women drivers in my time but none were as successful as i was
1245451 i drove from coast to coast border to border i traveled the national circuit driving in the winter in california florida and south texas every track we went to was different i drove door slammers super stocks
1245452 everyone was looking for a reason why i was there other than the racing as in all things when someone new is breaking in the mistakes you make are remembered and the good things are not but as i went along and proved myself i was accepted as a driver
1245453 when you leave the starting line in a good running car its a lot like the first hill on a roller coaster ride
1245454 the cars want to break loose all the time and the trick is keeping them within the lines i think women have a tendency to be better in coordinating the gear shifting part of it because they can make the arm movements quicker than men
1245455 as time went on i became more involved in the racing and he became less involved
1245456 do i have any regrets i cant say id do anything any differently i did my own thing pretty much i made enough money to make a living for a long time
1245457 at least on the west coast it is still raining however in a lot of places even if the rain is starting to ease off
1245458 it will take a while but towards the evening the cloud cover should begin to clear and the winds should ease off
1245459 they told me dont even worry about the depth chart they had to put it out
1245460 i think were going to try to do some things with anquan but i wouldnt feel comfortable with him going into the game without having done a lot of reps
1245461 but well be ready to play you cant be worried about who another team is playing and whos missing from whose lineup or anything like that
1245462 i can still do it i prefer to be inside it seems more natural to me but if they need me out there ill go out there and play it no one has said anything about it to me though

1245465 when i climb i get the same internal rewards as when i write or do yoga
1245466 it requires the same focus and creative energy in a way big wall climbing and first ascents have become my novels and short stories
1245467 i like to think of every new route i put up as a sculpture
1245468 i think very closely about the line the holds and features in the rock there is definitely an aesthetic sense to the process
1245469 i always thought it would be pretty special to teach my son how to climb here
1245470 lathrop had a very strong connection to the place so i thought the best way of honoring him would be to build a special route
1245471 i smile just thinking about it i dont know if he was the obvious choice but he was the right choice
1245472 ill tell you what hes still passionate still greatly dedicated to the profession he might be as excited now as ive ever seen him as a coach hes so excited for us for him for the usa
1245473 i really felt that 92 was going to be my olympic experience coaching the team was never in my mind at all because theyre all nba players now
1245474 i was fine with that as long as the u s won i was fine with that so i was surprised when jerry asked me it just wasnt on my radar
1245475 i had to come to the realization that he was the guy
1245476 popovich would have been a terrific choice but i eventually came to the conclusion that mike was the guy i wanted to do this job
1245477 you couldnt go wrong either way but im glad i made the decision i did everything thats happened over the last three years endorses that
1245478 weve all accomplished stuff tayshaun has a ring dwyane wade has a ring kobe has three of them lebrons gotten to the nba finals youve got to bring in a coach that everybody respects
1245479 he just brings a different mentality where whether youre no 1 or no 12 on the team and were all all stars on our teams were all equals
1245480 im not going to ever compete against them we can be who were going to be and that doesnt have to change during the nba season
1245481 im never going to try to defend you and youre never going to try to beat me its like im a completely different entity for them
1245482 were almost as big an opponent as anybody we played against really
1245483 one of the interesting things about this olympic team is that all these guys are good guys
1245484 its a great time for the nba and basketball in the u s to see the star player be a team player to be hustling to be respectful listening to coaching all the things that these guys are doing
1245485 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkestan islamic party warns china one more time our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed we warn china and the international community for the last time that those spectators athletes particularly the muslims who are planning to attend the olympics please change your intention from going to china please do not stand together with the faithless people the turkistan islamic party volunteers will conduct violent military actions against individuals departments venues and activities that are related to the olympics in china
1245486 the pakistani terrorism sponsoring activities along the silk road were the primary instrument of islamabads regional strategy the isi sponsored insurgency and terrorism along the western gateways to the prc were strategic developments with grave ramifications
1245487 china reportedly said that east turkestan uyghur islamic terrorists are operating on pakistans soil and trained in special camps in its territory this is the first time beijing administration charged pakistan for harboring anti china elements in its soil the revelation came in a court document in the trial of jailed canadian celil in which it was mentioned that celil joined the east turkistan liberation organisation etlo way back in 1997 and acted as a senior instructor in kyrgyzstan as per the document celil allegedly recruited people and sent them to various training camps on the pamir plateau in pakistan territory etlos prime objective is to carve an independent east turkestan by uniting parts of china and kyrgyzstan

1245497 de trend is nu onmiskenbaar dat bestuurders van beursgenoteerde bedrijven vaker persoonlijk aansprakelijk worden gesteld
1245498 juristen van gedupeerde aandeelhouders zoeken bij een tegenvaller in stukken echt naar een persoonlijk verwijtbare fout die hoeft niet tot een rechtszaak te leiden vaak gebruiken ze die als drukmiddel om tot uitbetaling te komen ze claimen breder vroeger richtten aandeelhouders zich op de raad van bestuur nu zijn ook commissarissen en toezichthouders aan de beurt
1245499 die uitbreiding in de nederlandse markt raakt onze goede zeden ook de openbare orde
1245500 als een bestuurder over de schreef gaat en wordt beboet dan moet hij ook zelf op de blaren zitten
1245501 het is zelfs voor zon groot concern niet meer op te brengen
1245502 leg je priv beslag dan wordt het voor bestuurders ineens heel emotioneel dat middel wordt steeds vaker gebruikt ik vind het verwerpelijk de scheidslijn tussen zakelijke verantwoordelijkheid en priv verdwijnt ik ken bestuurders die er aan zon claim onderdoor zijn gegaan
1245503 de kredietcrisis gaat ook nederlandse bedrijven raken van de miljardenclaims die er liggen komen er ontegenzeggelijk tot uitkering de omvang van deze claims is vele malen groter dan de jaarlijkse premie wij trekken ons bewust terug van die amerikaanse markt met zijn vuilnisbakkengeschiedenis er liggen daar miljardenclaims en een middagje procederen kost tonnen die zaken kunnen bovendien jaren duren daar willen we ons niet in begeven

1245509 inflation is intensifying and that is the main source of weakness in consumer spending
1245510 this is a kind of honey inflation ate my rebate check story
1245511 that real consumer spending is down two tenths in june is not a good thing in and of itself but it also is a bad thing for what it means for third quarter consumption
1245512 to get positive consumption growth in the third quarter is going to be very challenging especially with things like auto sales down as much as they are

1245523 the only reason we took this online casinos case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted
1245524 im really happy with the verdict in the recent online casinos case which was argued by my mentors steichen deni and lovetta jabaut who work at the prestigious vanderbie rullan inc law firm downtown
1245525 once i have a better grip on how to construct convincing online casinos arguments ill be able to apply for my legal license with the state in no time
1245526 the judge has a great law pedigree and this will allow us greater scope when the online casinos case is argued
1245527 well be doing mock online casinos class action lawsuit summations on friday
1245528 and grades will be based on presentation efficacy of argument use of facts and argument coherence
1245529 were working closely with the lead partners at the pipho simelton and allain mirza law firm to develop our new online casinos law curriculum
1245530 in hopes to provide real world insight for our studies that will prepare students adequately for the future
1245531 with students working hard on their online casinos law mid term exams ive been able to assist the mollie alleman and nichol jasper law team in the recent online casinos class action case this is proving to be a very good experience for me and it will dynamically boost the breadth of my curicular offerings as my pre law department advances
1245532 which probably means that well win this case handily the case put forth by my boss amsdell huyck was so convincing that we believe the jury will only be out for a couple days before they render their decision

1245681 our aim is to determine how the baby boy sustained his head injuries
1245682 what we do expect is to complete a really thorough scene examination thorough understanding of what took place were not saying either way if charges will be laid we need to understand what took place
1245683 the hospital have advised us the injuries are non accidental but we need to work through all that
1245684 if the money has not reached the party it constitutes theft if i receive another evasive reply then clearly it is a matter for the police
1245685 those three critical factors are the total answer to this question
1245686 is it correct convicted fraudster pelesa visesio skelton testified that her boss mr kerupi tavita never questioned her fraudulent claims including overseas travel expenses accommodation at luxury hotels hiring rental cars not to mention a flat screen tv and dvd player and why wouldnt any responsible senior manager question the need for his assistant to buy herself a flatscreen tv and dvd player at the departments expense

1245693 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1245694 it was an incredible moment when we realized the figures we were getting in they had not been previously recorded because these are very remote areas that are quite inaccessible and logistically tough to survey
1245695 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1245696 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1245697 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1245698 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live

1245709 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1245710 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1245711 there can be no breakup of sanzar absolutely not sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying
1245712 this one has been mooted before we have been over some of these ideas over the last few weeks
1245713 the plant will not be operating at full capacity and non critical staff will in fact be encouraged to participate in the stay away

1245739 or by members of their community using health education materials that had been adapted to that community
1245740 i think this is interesting research as it shows a reasonably consistent effect the reduction in blood pressure is not trivial it is the same as gained from taking pills
1245741 what we do not know is if garlic works as well as pills over the long term or if it would reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke
1245742 there is no harm in taking garlic along with other lifestyle factors such as eating less red meat less salt less alcohol and taking more exercise and also continuing to take blood pressure medication
1245743 anyone could benefit from regular doses of garlic but it is important not to assume that taking supplements is all you need to treat high blood pressure

1245748 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1245749 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1245750 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1245760 we havent decided how many players will be picked in the team if there are sixteen players in the team the selectors are likely to pick two wicket keepers if they pick only 15 dhoni will be the only wicket keeper and that will make eight batsmen including the indian captain and seven bowlers

1245768 for anyone who has lived on a college campus the feeling of metrome and other buildings aimed at young adults in downtown san diego will be instantly familiar while they may have been marketed like hip hotels the feeling of the social life in these buildings is more that of a college dorm and just as in a dorm these friends and acquaintances share a variety of duties and favors they give one another rides to the airport when they fly to visit their families they have group holiday parties several of the women in the network have dogs and care for one anothers pets or take them on walks together a couple of the women in the building said that they liked knowing testuide because he makes them feel safer although no one has ever called on him to do anything more that escort them home from a nightclub they vet potential suitors if you want to take jennifer feldman out on a third date for instance youd better be ready to pass muster in the eyes of bethann barry

1245792 he was a key witness in the case and was also interviewed by the scotland yard experts who came to pakistan to investigate her killing

1245812 it is a common practice to make multiple program configurations and then use them according to different situations
1245813 once created a configuration includes all the information about program appearance custom settings and all operations performed and planned its very convenient not to change all these parameters manually every time you have to set up the program for executing a specific task its enough to simply load a configuration that meets your current needs and thats all such approach is also useful when upgrading to a new version and our new import export settings option makes it possible program settings are saved in zip format and accessible for reviewing and editing

1245815 my losing a friendship is not as important as this friend losing an eternity
1245816 following meetings between the social partners and the taoiseach in a few weeks time the prospects for a national agreement will become clear
1245817 in many companies and sectors pay arrangements are still covered by the current agreement if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1245818 the collapse of the pay talks further dispels the myth of fianna fails supposed competence on the economy the government found it easy to broker a deal between unions and employers when they could pay for it through the proceeds of a debt fuelled boom and explosion in public spending
1245819 now that the government is facing a tougher economic climate its entire economic policy is unravelling with unemployment rising house prices falling business and consumer confidence plummeting and nothing on offer from the government to tackle any of the problems facing the economy
1245820 for the avoidance of doubt about what trade unions were prepared to contemplate in an national agreement we were prepared to accept that it would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid
1245821 it is extremely difficult to put an accurate figure on the actual cost of such activities and estimates range from 7 5pc to 15 8pc of gnp
1245822 isme estimates that core black economy activities could account for up to 11pc of gnp which would equate to over 17 7bn
1245823 the amount of unpaid taxes alone is conservatively estimated at 3 54bn which could be used to substantially reverse the current exchequer revenue shortfall
1245824 whether we like it or not ireland has become an expensive place to run a business and many companies are being forced into the shadow economy to generate cash flow simply to survive
1245825 ireland is one of the few oecd countries with an unlimited duration for social welfare benefits also inflation makes access to welfare based housing and other benefits more attractive than gainful employment
1245826 our welfare system in some circumstances affords dependent householders a higher standard of living than those who work
1245827 any suggestion of a general direction by ibec to employers to the effect that they should refuse to engage with us would contravene most collective agreements and therefore raise the prospect of industrial unrest long before it would otherwise be anticipated
1245828 by telling their members not to engage in local collective bargaining they are laying the foundations for serious industrial unrest in this country
1245829 could still be possible if the social partners can show leadership in charting a way forward
1245830 if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1245831 simply not feasible for low paid workers who desperately need an increase in income in preparation for increased energy and food costs this winter
1245832 the reality is that the negotiations have broken down and there are no arrangements to reconvene there has been no indication from the employers they will adopt a more reasonable stance if the talks were to resume accordingly we have no alternative other than to press ahead with our claims directly on those employers
1245833 there is an inability to pay clause in social partnership agreements which has worked very well until now
1245834 that would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid if such an agreement was supported by a government anti inflation strategy this would send out a very positive message about our economic management
1245835 time and again we see that what people watch on tv shapes how they view and treat the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people around them
1245836 abc and fx are leading the way when it comes to telling our stories showing other networks that including images of our community can go hand in hand with critical and commercial success this years glaad network responsibility index offers an in depth examination of where networks excelled and how they can improve particularly in conveying the diversity of our lives
1245837 networks have a responsibility to make sure the images they broadcast foster awareness understanding and respect of the full diversity of our community
1245838 when lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people are portrayed in a fair accurate and inclusive manner on television it has the power to change hearts and minds
1245839 its going to take a lot of time and of course money to get you to a good functioning point
1245840 i dont think we can keep control of violent prisoners by calling them by their first name
1245841 rather than criticise officers for their use of force the inspectors should look at the underlying problems
1245842 there is more and more violence at prisons because of a lack of staff there are major problems with overcrowding and prisoners who shouldnt be there
1245843 sanctions are in place for those prisoners who break rules i dont think were too hard on them i think we have a balanced approach which helps protect the public and reduces reoffending
1245844 every a a has found that he can make little headway in this new adventure of living until he first backtracks and really makes an accurate and unsparing survey of the human wreckage he has left in his wake
1245845 to a degree he has already done this when taking a moral inventory but now the time has come when he ought to redouble his efforts to see how many people he has hurt and in what ways
1245846 this reopening of emotional wounds some old some perhaps forgotten and some still painfully festering will at first look like a purposeless and pointless piece of surgery but if a willing start is made then the great advantage of doing this will so quickly reveal themselves that the pain will be lessened as one obstacle after another melts away
1245847 these obstacles however are very real the first and one of the most difficult has to do with forgiveness the moment we ponder a twisted or broken relationship with another person our emotions go on the defensive to escape looking at the wrongs we have done another we resentfully focus on the wrong he she has done us this is especially true if he she has in fact behaved badly at all triumphantly we seize upon his her misbehavior as the perfect excuse for minimizing or forgetting our own
1245848 what i do today i can use 5 years from now
1245849 oh akeeyu how are you doing how are the babies
1245850 did you see that magazine that cover with the ah the jo lo
1245851 she waited so long you know i think those babies were her reward because of everything she had to go through
1245852 i would never wear a skirt that short walk down that street at that hour
1245853 am i the only one that has this idea that jlo broke bens heart not the other way around
1245854 hey did you get a load of that test the one that indicated we had hadnt sustained any damage thus far wasnt that like way awesome
1245855 interesting well i will do my best not to gag you with a fork dudes
1245856 so we would like to have a word with you
1245857 well seeing as how youre already staying up nights worrying about millbarge were thinking this would be a really excellent time for us to experience our first cold
1245858 actually now is kind of a bad time for me
1245859 well really whats the worst that could happen in this situation
1245860 theyre perfect theyre wonderful theyre exactly who theyre supposed to be
1245861 babies always grow out of this unless they have serious neurological impairments so its just a matter of getting her through it without sustaining organ damage now lets talk about her symptoms she is doing better yes
1245862 my god this whole parenting thing isnt what i expected at all
1245863 this is exactly what i expected parenting would be like
1245864 if you want to play with a penis play with your own
1245865 i keep telling her that the wicked formula syndicate will keep making cans of powdered evil for her eating pleasure but she doesnt really listen to me at this stage babies are not all that bright
1245866 but why dont you just feed them at the same time
1245867 wheres the fun the smiles the coos oops weve got colic so time to go marching around the neighborhood in a hot sling in the hot summer again since its the only way i can stop the screaming
1245868 okay youre screaming so youre probably not going to appreciate the subtleties here but what im doing now is heating up your bottle in a pot of warm water which you will hopefully drink without having an attack of reflux
1245869 sure there are swings you can buy that will rock your baby for you but why would you use those when you can hold your baby in your arms and rock your baby yourself
1245870 well gee the answer to thats obvious isnt it its so i wont go crazy and hurt him
1245871 oh a baby enjoy it while you can they grow up so fast
1245872 feeding two newborns at once is a little like trying to catch two feral cats simultaneously and dress them in tiny roller disco costumes the satin jackets arent so bad but the eight tiny roller skates will fucking kill you
1245873 no milk in there well okay theres still kind of milk in there but its poison milk here have some formula instead according to the internet formula is poison too mmmm good huh sweet sweeeeet poison
1245874 gee im at a crazy high risk for postpartum psychosis and the medications needed to lower that risk are so dangerous in breast milk that my children would have to have weekly blood draws and frequent ekgs and might still end up with idiopathic brain thyroid and liver changes but wait this can of formula says that breastfeeding is best oh in that case
1245875 well i have to go back to work pretty soon because my company government doesnt offer a real maternity leave package and there are no laws in my state protecting my right to pump or breastfeed at work so breastfeeding exclusively for six months is just not going to happen but wait this can of formula says that breastfeeding is best oh in that case
1245876 a mother who can get out of bed and take a shower occasionally is best
1245877 im taking required medications that will kill my baby if i breastfeed but thanks for trying to make me feel bad about it you judgmental cow
1245878 my kids adopted but im sure i can start lactating on command just for you you judgmental cow
1245879 and what exactly makes you the authority on this issue eh because i sure as fuck think im smarter than you sat scores lets compare books read in the last week bring it on level of education oh yeah i smoked you on that too so yeah i think im a little better qualified to make my own goddamned decisions but thanks for your concern why dont you re allocate that attention youre bothering me with to your own kids because your 8 year old just ate his own snot
1245880 when you eat your lunch sitting on a dirty public toilet ill feed him there
1245881 what more do you want from me im breastfeeding right the fuck now
1245882 breastfeeding is for irrational perfectionists who also force their kids to look at flash cards all day
1245883 dont you get it this is not your fault you cant control this
1245884 i was on bedrest for months till i got ass sores and jiggly tiny baby muscles just to bring them into the world after years of infertility i went off my meds during gestation i ate entire cows for lunch and fought gestational diabetes i now would like to be the sanest person i can for my children and am therefor taking my meds and do not wish to poison the children i nearly killed myself to bring into this world so fuck you you judgemental cow
1245885 they wont sleep we swaddle we rock we do all that happiest baby on the block stuff and they just dont care what else can we do i mean you can lead the tiny little horse to the tiny little water but you cant make it take tiny little drinks how do we make them sleeeeep
1245886 well you cant but theyll sleep when they need to
1245887 the pediatricians at tbfpp told us that our daughter has a birth defect
1245888 she needs to be seen by the specialist this week how can we make that happen
1245889 tbfpp doesnt have any authorization to make a referral youll have to take her back to her eic inc pediatrician they can submit the referral then it will go to a committee and if the committee approves it theyll send you a letter
1245890 is this really what you want to do today do you really want to be a party to denying healthcare to a potentially sick newborn and sound like you dont give a shit while you do it are you prepared to answer to your supervisor over this issue aw fuck your supervisor are you prepared to answer to your god are you
1245891 may you someday be the recipient of the same caliber of care you currently provide to others
1245892 dear millbarge buttmansion your referral to the specialist hospital has been approved this referral is active from birth until one day before the date of the appointment and covers initial evaluation and treatment
1245893 dear millbarge buttmansion your referral to the specialist hospital has been approved this referral is active from the day of the appointment until august and covers six appointments treatment and surgery if needed
1245894 dear millbarge buttmansion we are writing to let you know that the service specified below the specialist hospital office visit is not covered patient does not have active evil insurance company inc coverage eic inc will not pay for these unauthorized services you will be billed for these services you have the right to appeal this decision although it might be a tad bit difficult for you to read the directions for filing an appeal since you are in fact a tiny little baby and communicate mostly through grunting and the expulsion of bodily wastes
1245895 our daughter does not appear to be on our insurance yet
1245896 okay i need the unregistered childs birthdate in order to process this
1245897 we need to clear up your billing situation i dont think eic is covering you
1245898 fine sir just let me get through this contraction first ok
1245899 hmm let me look that up for you usually those are done sooner than this what hospital did you deliver at oh eic yeah those usually take a while longer
1245900 well as long as im here maybe ill have some neural monitoring before i go home
1245901 mr dad there appears to be an error here you have two children listed with the same birthdate
1245902 i think this is a mistake this sounds like someone elses story i feel like this is happening to someone else
1245903 sure what the hell else can go wrong during this gestation
1245904 i believe theyll have a room ready for you in an hour
1245905 dont those drugs pretty much counteract each other how can this possibly work
1245906 well if we dont give you mag youll probably start having seizures pretty soon
1245907 how is the pain well want to do an epidural when the pain is like this and before the pain is like that
1245908 take your time think about what you want us to do ill be back in a bit to see if you have any questions
1245909 sometimes women bleed a lot after if they have to do a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding you tell them its okay i wont be mad if you tell them its okay
1245910 its okay to be scared hon but were going to take good care of you we do this all the time
1245911 oh is that what you were doing it just sounded like moaning to everyone else
1245912 i thought babies were supposed to be ugly do you think shes ours
1245913 were going to give you something to help your uterus contract
1245914 even so i felt very discouraged it had taken science to get me pregnant science to keep me pregnant and now it would take another enormous helping of science to get me un pregnant i felt like an observer of this pregnancy rather than a participant all i could think about was how i had repeatedly failed how my body had to be bludgeoned into doing what everybody elses body seemed to do with ease how incredibly unwomanly i felt
1245915 i bet you didnt go through half of what i did to get yours

1245919 the worst part is over and i have had a lot of difficulties to overcome since the beginning but right now i am very happy with the progress i am making
1245920 that is thanks to the help i have had and i am just waiting for the moment when i am ready to play again
1245921 yes it can be difficult at times because i have never been through something like this before
1245922 i am still trying to get my focus back but the worst part is done with

1245931 a lot of animals that died during rita were cases of overheating because of power outages not because of the storm
1245932 cats are more attached to their territory than to their owner
1245933 its important to keep them comfortable while they are contained for long periods of time
1245934 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1245935 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1245936 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1245937 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1245938 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1245939 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive
1245940 marco confortola is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp abc that is at an altitude of 6 000 metres
1245941 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 metres due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was mr confortola said
1245942 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
1245943 es dif cil que renault pueda estar en 2009 al nivel de los grandes

1245945 surveys suggest a softening in business activity and there have also been early signs of an easing in labor market conditions
1245946 with demand slowing the central banks boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1245947 begin a series of rate cuts over the next few months taking the cash rate down to 6 by late 2009 but the first rate cut appears to be contingent upon firm evidence that wages growth will stay contained
1245948 as being important in whether the reserve bank will start cutting the cash rate sooner rather than later
1245949 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
1245950 h muito a fazer para evitar a venda de produtos em locais n o oficiais mas podemos controlar isso nos encontramos com v rias empresas que nem sequer sabiam que era ilegal faz lo

1245954 there can be no discussion of bilateral negotiations behind the back of russia which is sheltering our children and is the sole guarantor of peace we are prepared for any meeting in the existing four sided format
1245955 attempts by the georgian side to change the format are viewed by south ossetia as attempts to break down the negotiation process and are destined for failure
1245956 are of a retaliatory character against the buildup and deployment of armed formations on the georgian side
1245957 i want to state that we will continue provide for the security of the citizens of the republic in its entirety and we will respond adequately to the action s of the georgian side
1245958 not in the format of the so called mixed control commission

1246046 sip trunking is not as widespread among our channel partners as it could be but it is growing in popularity and the demand is increasing from customers
1246047 most partners now have come up to speed with it are familiar with ip technology and anxious to have sip trunking
1246048 our resellers to get new customers that they wouldnt ordinarily be able to get and hang on to customers that they already have
1246049 small companies with less than 10 users will not see the value of sip trunking the larger the company the higher the interest
1246050 the nationwide interoperability of toshibas equipment and paetecs sip trunking mitigates the need for large enterprises to create patchwork network solutions to address different parts of the country
1246051 quite often the reseller ends up being a sales agent for the local telephone provider anyway
1246052 as enterprise sip solutions evolve agreements between service providers and equipment manufacturers will increasingly become prevalent
1246053 this will simplify the process of migrating enterprise customers to sip solutions

1246061 penduduk kbpt merupakan peneroka bandar di tanah tersebut sejak 1980 an mereka telah berusaha membeli tanah yang asalnya tiada pemilik ini tetapi gagal selepas geran tanah tersebut diberi kepada syarikat swasta
1246062 pemaju sekarang bukit lenang development sdn bhd telah membeli tanah ini pada tahun 1996 11 tahun selepas penduduk tinggal atas tanah ini
1246063 bukit lenang telah cuba mengusir penduduk keluar dari tanah ini dengan menyaman penduduk di mahkamah sejak 10 tahun yang lepas
1246064 pelannya antara lain mencatat bahawa wilayah persekutuan kuala lumpur hanya mempunyai kira kira 160 000 masyarakat kaum india
1246065 saya dapati ini agak aneh kami mempunyai kira kira 80 000 pengundi berdaftar kaum india di kuala lumpur
1246066 sekiranya satu keluarga mempunyai dua orang anak dan sekiranya kita darab dengan empat termasuk dua ibu bapa angkanya akan mencatat terdapat sebanyak 320 000 masyarakat india
1246067 macam mana pula dengan masyarakat india yang tidak mendaftar sebagai pengundi
1246068 memandangkan kepada faktor sejarah iaitu beliau merupakan penyandang kerusi itu sejak tahun 1982 hinggalah beliau ditahan pada 1998 mungkin tiada calon tempatan yang boleh menandingi anwar
1246069 calon untuk bertanding memanglah ada tetapi bolehkah beliau menandingi kekuatan anwar
1246070 ezam memang bersedia untuk bertanding tetapi beliau juga tidak dapat menjamin kemenangan bn kerana beliau bukan anak tempatan
1246071 tambahan pula beliau merupakan bekas setiausaha politik anwar justeru dari segi budaya politik orang tempatan tentunya tidak senang bila ezam mencabar bekas ketuanya
1246072 selain itu pilihan raya ini akan berlaku ketika harga minyak masih tinggi dan ekonomi juga belum stabil yang merupakan masalah yang belum mampu diselesaikan kerajaan
1246073 sebelum pilihan raya umum pulau pinang milik bn tetapi kini sudah menjadi milik dap
1246074 bagaimanapun walau sesukar manapun jalan untuk bn mereka tetap terpaksa bertanding
1246075 saya serahkan kepada anggota untuk membuat keputusan mereka akan menentukan esok rabu
1246076 sebelum anwar kerusi itu adalah milik pas hanya apabila anwar bertanding di situ pada 1982 kerusi tersebut menjadi milik bn
1246077 kemudian apabila isteri anwar datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail bertanding kerusi itu menjadi hak milik pkr
1246078 justeru kita dapat lihat pengundi lebih mengutamakan individu itu sendiri daripada parti
1246079 ezam bukan anak tempatan sedangkan datuk pirdaus ismail wakil bn di permatang pauh pada pilihan raya umum lalu yang merupakan bekas imam dan berasal dari pulau pinang juga gagal merampas kerusi itu
1246080 itu antara kekuatan pkr anwar sering menyatakan yang beliau prihatin terhadap nasib rakyat berikutan kenaikan harga minyak sedangkan kerajaan tidak dapat berbuat apa apa berhubung isu itu
1246081 bn akan tetap memberikan saingan tetapi permatang pauh merupakan kubu anwar justeru agak sukar untuk merampasnya
1246082 kalau tidak nanti kalau kita bercakap dalam dewan kata tidak adil kerana dia tidak ada di situ untuk membela diri dia bagi saya elok dia duduk dalam dewan supaya kita akan dapat secara langsung jawapan daripadanya dalam kes kes tertentu
1246083 kalau dia kat luar dia cakap dalam ceramah dan kita tak boleh nak jawap dalam dewan kita boleh tanya dia lagi baik
1246084 kalau tidak nanti kalau kita bercakap dalam dewan kata tidak adil kerana dia tidak ada di situ untuk membela diri dia bagi saya elok dia duduk dalam dewan supaya kita akan dapat secara langsung jawapan daripadanya dalam kes kes tertentu
1246085 saya bukan nak marah apa tapi kalau kita boleh belanja banyak untuk sms apa salahnya kita campakkan duit tu untuk buat kebajikan

1246093 we will invest in india in mumbai there is a gold jewellery industry cluster however at present we intend to import the jewellery from thailand
1246094 retailers will sell our range after adding their margin the margin will be controlled
1246095 india is the worlds biggest jewellery market and has an untapped market for 24 carat gold
1246096 my idea for any creation is very simple but it is my imagination that gives body to my vision
1246097 this alliance gives me an opportunity to know more about india its culture and people who are well known for their grand weddings and other ceremonies
1246098 i am fascinated by the beauty of temples in india i would like to use them in my designing

1246102 i chose this profession because i did not have a job but later i realised that this is what i wanted to do all my life
1246103 it is all about being at the right place at the right time
1246104 no matter how glamourous or sexy a woman is i cant stand her if i see her nail polish is chipped or that she has dry or dirty hands and feet
1246105 it brightens the face instantly and adds depth if you want your face to look angular use a dark blush on the hollows of your cheeks but if you want to give your complexion a warm glow dust some on the apples of your cheeks
1246106 fair skinned women should use peach or rose blush while those with dark skin should opt for rust plum and brownish red shimmery powder when dusted over the cheekbones manipulates the way light reflects off the contours of your face and gives a fulsome glam look
1246107 the right colour of eye shadow can add instant glamour even the simplest and barest of makeup can look smashing if the eye makeup is correct because eyes are the most prominent feature of the face if you look closely all the models in international glamour magazines wear bold eye shadows they add colour to the face and give an ethereal appeal
1246108 lack of awareness about the art of makeup women dont know how to apply eye shadow what kind to buy and how to match it
1246109 pale tones like wine and violet are best for dark women if you are fair opt for blue green and other dark shades only for the night aqua blue and peacock shades go with any skin tone
1246110 an eyeliner alone can give the wearer a very soft and innocent look matched with eye shadow and mascara eyeliners add the needed drama and definition to the eyes they make the eyes look larger and when used in conjunction with mascara make them look fresh
1246111 you start to feel and look sexy the moment you don high heels stilettos work best because they make you stand on your toes automatically the posture changes and the body forms an s curve calf muscles get pronounced the shoulders and the butt are pushed back and the bust is thrust forward as a result a womans gait too becomes seductive
1246112 they look flattering and are definitely more slimming than flats

1246128 drug company chiefs should learn a lesson from bristol myers squibb that they will pay dearly for cheating consumers and taxpayers

1246135 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy

1246137 only permissible sounds are the prayers of the killers and the cries of their victims
1246138 we are seeing ssd interest in a variety of applications where historically hard disk drives have reigned for many the most logical place is in notebook computers but there is incredible value for ssds in enterprise server systems

1246140 we were just below 300 million gallons a day over the weekend compared to our record 351 million gallon daily usage
1246141 we thought it would be higher than it has been maybe our conservation efforts are working
1246142 we are going to see temperatures drop a little into the upper 90s wednesday or thursday
1246143 that doesnt sound that great but its a little cooler
1246144 we set up areas in our centers last week where people can sit and relax and stay out of this awful heat one has had a total of eight people since last week and some have had nobody
1246145 its usually due to two factors the desire to save on air conditioning at home or to eat lunch without having to heat up their kitchens
1246146 we had 200 to 300 people on hot days last week
1246147 if we get overcrowded we collaborate with different agencies we dont want individuals outside in this heat
1246148 maybe that means people are finding other safe places to go

1246155 i think you address the aesthetics as you would any other allowable business in an industrial zone

1246157 if you think i look healthy and great and i have hiv then the person youre having sex with might have it too
1246158 she always talks about it around my friends because a lot of them dont know as much as i do
1246159 im trying to reach one person and get that one person to change their life
1246160 i wanted to so badly and im scared of heights
1246161 i thought it was a gay white mans disease it didnt feel like it had hit our community yet
1246162 sometimes god needs to get your attention and he will take away everything you have your house your car your health your spouse and when i got the diagnosis all that was happening to me
1246163 all the nice stuff they were saying about you a few minutes before thats all out the window
1246164 i had to change my mindset that i was worth more than sex

1246166 if i just expect god to give me a sunny happy day every day of my life then am i really trusting god
1246167 the patient likely has resistant bacteria it is really important that we wash our hands after every encounter
1246168 you are as subject to giving in to the allure of performance enhancing drugs as an olympic athlete
1246169 people have come into my office with cardiac arrhythmias caused by combining a red bull habit with sudafed
1246170 drugs are for medical conditions being an athlete is not a medical condition
1246171 the problem is that stimulants will elevate your heart rate and combining them is a bad idea
1246172 when people reach the limits of their god given talent and they dont want their dream to end there
1246173 are there any performance enhancing drugs that any recreational runner is able to pick up at a pharmacy w out a prescription drugs that obviously arent meant for performance enhancing but are
1246174 creatine an over the counter dietary supplement and muscle builder caffeine and other stimulants found in cold medicine allergy medicine or weight loss pills
1246175 just tell a doc you tried tramadol a prescription opiate for back pain and it worked great then take it with caffeine 30 minutes before a race for a big boost
1246176 one ibuprofen one red bull a caffeinated energy drink and wash em down with a cup of coffee about 30 minutes before high intensity demand ready to go
1246177 i know lots of people who pop sudafed to enhance their performance and pound cokes and red bulls
1246178 hickey notes that most of the benefit is probably psychological
1246179 should be a contest of character not a contest of pharmacology
1246180 they see what the pros are doing no doz strapped to the bike for example or something worse and theyll follow their heroes
1246181 given what you hear you just dont know performance enhancing drugs are on our radar
1246182 the whole amateur side of it people take it too seriously they think nothing of spending all their savings on equipment when all they need to do is train more and lose weight why wouldnt these same people looking for an edge turn to drugs its a type a personality where their goals are the be all and end all of their existence
1246183 absolutely a 45 year old who spends 10 000 on a bike will find a doctor who will help with a friendly diagnosis
1246184 if you start drug testing in masters sports you are as likely to catch a 75 year old legitimately taking hormones for prostate cancer
1246185 i do have a sense of morality integrity and honesty which seems to take precedence over my desire to be a better athlete that is not to say the thought of taking sudafed or getting an inhaler hasnt crossed my mind i just let it slide on in through and out of my mind

1246221 what i call the magic jurisdictions is where the judiciary is elected with verdict money the trial lawyers have established relationships with the judges that are elected they are state court judges they are populists they have large populations of voters who are in on the deal they are getting their piece in many cases and so its a political force in their jurisdiction and its almost impossible to get a fair trial if you are a defendant in some of these places the plaintiff lawyer walks in there and writes the number on the blackboard and the first juror meets the last one coming out the door with that amount of money the cases are not won in the courtroom theyre won on the back roads long before the case goes to trial any lawyer fresh out of law school can walk in there and win the case so it doesnt matter what the evidence or the law is

1246247 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshops
1246248 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them
1246249 we will have to accommodate that by rotating people they will not be expected to go right through the season
1246250 lewis will have his wish next year hell be racing every other week at least
1246251 heikki is going to benefit from knowing he has a secure position next year
1246252 it was the right time to tell him to show him we have belief in his abilities because clearly he is super quick no question about that
1246253 he is still not quite where we want him to be
1246254 but we knew it would take time because that was the assessment aki hintsa head of human performance made at the start of the season
1246255 but when he gets into full physical condition then hes going to be an outstanding driver
1246256 heikki has a long way to go in his career
1246257 last season was remarkable and it is the same for this season
1246258 it is just so tight with good drivers in both teams ferrari and mclaren
1246259 right now they are all in with a shout which is very good for the sport because you dont want it to become predictable and you dont want number one drivers in a team
1246260 but at this stage you just cannot call where the title is going to go it could be any one of four
1246261 i wouldnt even discount heikki even though he knows he has pace to find on lewis
1246262 but he will be boosted by winning a grand prix so the ingredients are there with all four looking more like seasoned drivers which is helping
1246263 if you had asked me before the race though who i would put money on i would have said lewis but i have to say i would want my bet back
1246264 id be saying wait a moment that ferrari looks strong so as an outside bet id put my money on raikkonen
1246265 it is so much more competitive than when i was driving in my championship year with williams
1246266 you really do have a much more difficult task to win three grands prix on the trot than you did back then
1246267 he made a great start it was a great move it was a senna esque overtaking manoeuvre
1246268 but then he had such bad luck and it can be quite difficult to pick yourself up from that
1246269 there is a huge gulf from something that is there on paper and what is real

1246273 instead of trying to reproduce something exactly as it was
1246274 the novels popular in japan since the early part of this century
1246275 have been on the whole just this kind of didactic novel and not real novels
1246276 women and children who are fundamentally ignorant and poorly educated
1246277 perfect beautifully executed work of art that profoundly inspires a reader
1246278 the pleasure the reader feels in other words the novel is meant to entertain people
1246279 the main business of the novel is human nature i e mans sensual passions what buddhism calls the one hundred and eight appetites of the flesh
1246280 as music avoids bawdiness painting eroticism and poetry and drama vulgar language
1246281 should be dealt with as briefly as possible and the rest left to the readers imagination to lay bare the mysteries of the bedroom and reproduce the details of their conversation there in the name of realism is a task belonging not to the novelist but to the writer of love stories
1246282 the scope of the novel is on the whole wider than that of the theatre
1246283 extravagance false sentiment defiance of probability whether physical or moral pedantry pornography puns and other meretricious ornaments of style impossible adventures
1246284 appreciating them i e edo literature on their own terms
1246285 had long been considered unworthy of the attention of the educated
1246286 as a form of art the equal of poetry music or painting
1246287 realism rather than didacticism would be the aim of characterization and plot
1246288 do not waste your time worshipping bakin and shunsui and tanehiko make up your minds to avoid stereotypes reform the japanese novel and write masterpieces worthy of a place in art
1246289 the idea of using genbunitchi as a means of spreading education and reaching all japanese was firmly implanted and had to a considerable extent won out against traditional prejudices
1246290 what i really mean is a lack of dramatic sense
1246291 our tanka and ch ka by comparison with western poetry are very simple they do no more than express a transient emotion
1246292 an intelligent person once defined literature as existing solely to provide a critique of life
1246293 authors should always make the discussion of life the first consideration of their writing
1246294 attempts to describe human nature by which he means the 108 buddhist bonn passions and social conditions
1246295 when closer inspection reveals both the operator and the mechanism
1246296 he should think of them as living people in speaking of their feelings he should stand by as an onlooker and describe things as they are rather than superimposing his own ideas of emotion good or bad upon them

1246324 long periods of unemployment during which he and others wrote films no one particularly wanted to make
1246325 then we realized it was way less commercial than superbad
1246326 my favourite movies of all time hopefully they are this generations classic comedies
1246327 well ya know im from vancouver thats research in and of itself yeah i smoked a lot of weed growing up this film deals with our kind of everyday weed experience and is based on our lives irresponsibly building them around our ability to smoke as much weed as humanly possible
1246328 i remember seeing the opening night of ghostbusters on 1984 at the plainview theatre at 8 oclock for me it was like going to see led zeppelin the place exploded it was one of greatest comedy experiences ive ever had it was an event

1246332 the studio has a gun to your head cancellation and its a powerful weapon they use to force you to make changes to your show that you dont want to make and then your vision gets watered down and the show doesnt work as well
1246333 hes a modern sweet curmudgeon for me he does what bill murray does after undeclared was cancelled i thought i havent begun to scratch the surface of what he can do
1246334 hungering for more rogen the rogen hunger is happening right now
1246335 i found a way to make people money five years ago i hadnt so they couldnt figure out what was wrong with my work and theyd try to tinker but after i produced anchorman with will ferrell and made 40 year old virgin they said well maybe the guy can make movies and then they give you more creative freedom and the work becomes better because its not as watered down you wont hit a home run every time out but if your ratios pretty good you can take some creative chances and even make some strange weed action movies with james franco doing comedy that wouldnt have happened five years ago
1246336 its fun to try to do something thoughtful and really really funny these are dramas that should make you piss your pants i start with the idea and hang the jokes on it
1246337 my suggestion of what well do and i intend to talk to our city council about it is that we create by ordinance a provision that when an agricultural property is cleared of trees and then sold to a developer then that becomes a taxable event so that you have to pay the mitigation damages because its no longer being used for agricultural land
1246338 i would anticipate it would be challenged because its a pretty sweet deal now
1246339 i doubt when the legislature was trying to protect agricultural land i doubt if they envisioned that ranchers will clear all the trees and sell it to a developer that probably was not envisioned i think there will be legislators who will be willing to close that loophole
1246340 one thing im not going to do is just to sit here for the last year of office and watch trees be cleared on a grand scale and feel like theres nothing we can do but wring our hands
1246341 im not going to do that im going to take action

1246345 weve lost the series against south africa but we were in a good position in the first test and we were in a good position in this last test
1246346 it wasnt a massive defeat we were somewhere near it just needed to be finished off which didnt happen whatever people say on the outside we know whats going on in the inside and im quietly confident weve got the players to actually do the job for us
1246347 ravis in good form with the bat and can do a good bowling job for us as well so hes got his opportunity
1246348 when players get left out their only shop window then is to go and do the job in county cricket work on the problems that we tell them theyve got and then rectify them
1246349 what ravi has done is listen to that and has gone away and worked at his game and hes now got his chance hes a very determined character hes a big positive thinker and hell be very disappointed that he didnt perform last time around
1246350 im not interested in picking bits and pieces cricketers because he is more than a bits and pieces cricketer he can bat up the order and hes developed his bowling so that gives us an option with left arm spin
1246351 weve watched him in county cricket and hes in a far better place than he was 12 months ago and now hes got a chance to prove where he is in a game which is probably another step up from county cricket

1246355 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard yesterday about which direction they wanted to go in
1246356 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short
1246357 im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently
1246358 i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1246359 i enjoyed it when i had a go a couple of years ago but the selectors have opted to go another way and youve got to take that on the chin
1246360 what is important is that we all get behind kevin and give 100 support because if you dont have the players behind you that is a very tough starting position
1246361 by making one captain in all forms it looks like the selectors are trying to consolidate and will give someone a good run at leading the side
1246362 it is important the players get stuck in and improve on our performances we havent been quite where we want to be as a team in the last few months
1246363 it is not a surprise for me to see such advertisements on television now because i have become aware of condoms functions in hiv prevention through many other channels such as news reports in recent years

1246368 la reestructuraci n de pdvsa busca adecuarla a los acuerdos con las transnacionales en el marco de las empresas mixtas
1246369 la reestructuraci n de nuestra principal industria anunciada por el gobierno por boca del ministro presidente de pdvsa apunta a colocar a la empresa a tono con las pol ticas de acuerdos con transnacionales mediante la f rmula de empresas mixtas que lesionan gravemente la soberan a del pa s
1246370 sin duda que pdvsa necesita una reestructuraci n profunda para ponerla realmente a tono con el proceso revolucionario y con los intereses de sus trabajadores y el pueblo venezolano
1246371 es falso que pdvsa sea del pueblo como dice el slogan gubernamental por el contrario hoy la principal fuente de recursos con que cuenta el pa s se encuentra dirigida por una tecnoburocracia que se viste de rojo rojito pero que todos los d as humilla a los trabajadores abusa del poder y desoye los reclamos laborales una burocracia que repite los viejos m todos del pasado puntofijista que utiliza para su provecho los bienes de la empresa que ha convertido el ingreso a pdvsa en un privilegio de familia tal como hac an los gerentes y merit cratas de la iv rep blica hoy nuestra principal industria es dirigida por una caterva de sinverg enzas e incapaces que est n haciendo ca da y mesa limpia con los recursos de todo el pueblo creando una situaci n de alto riesgo debido al deterioro de las condiciones de higiene y seguridad industrial
1246372 la propuesta de reestructuraci n de pdvsa que el gobierno est planteando es un tema de much sima importancia que debe ser conocido y abordado en profundidad por los trabajadores petroleros y por todos los venezolanos por la gran importancia que tiene el tema petrolero para la econom a del pa s una reestructuraci n del modelo de gesti n de pdvsa es un asunto estrat gico que no puede quedar en manos exclusivamente de un peque o sanedr n de 7 supercomisionados mucho menos si esta comisi n es nombrada por la misma tecnoburocracia roja rojita que desatiende los reclamos de los trabajadores y lleva al descalabro a nuestra m s importante empresa eso ser a como poner a un zamuro a cuidar carne
1246373 por otra parte desde mi punto de vista queda claro que no se trata de modificar la gesti n interna de la empresa a favor de los trabajadores por el contrario lo que se busca es adecuar pdvsa a los acuerdos con el empresariado y con las transnacionales que hoy se benefician de las llamadas empresas mixtas esta reestructuraci n debe ser vista en el marco del acto del pasado 11 de junio con la alta burgues a nacional tambi n debe ser considerada en el contexto de las afirmaciones recientemente formuladas por el ministro ram rez a una revista chilena en las que tild a los trabajadores venezolanos de conservadores y privilegiados o por el cuestionamiento que en d as pasados hizo el presidente ch vez al contrato de los trabajadores de vtv declaraciones en las que ofendi la dignidad de un humilde camar grafo de esa empresa
1246374 la reestructuraci n que se est proponiendo persigue colocar de forma m s clara el conjunto de la gesti n y la organizaci n interna de pdvsa al servicio de los acuerdos de empresas mixtas con las transnacionales entre otras cosas busca disminuir el papel de los sindicatos y limitar el derecho a la contrataci n colectiva en aras de la paz social entre trabajadores y patronos por ello las mesas de di logo que fueron una conquista arrancada a la gerencia con la lucha y la movilizaci n de los trabajadores para tratar de resolver sus principales problemas ahora el gobierno las reivindica como suyas y trata de utilizarlas para sustituir a las organizaciones sindicales incluso poniendo en riesgo el derecho a la contrataci n colectiva ya que se pretender a eliminarlo progresivamente y que sea en las mesas de di logo o por normativa interna donde se establecer an las reivindicaciones de los trabajadores
1246375 y esto no lo decimos en abstracto ya el presidente ch vez cuestion el contrato colectivo de una empresa estatal como vtv lo que significa una violaci n a la autonom a de los sindicatos y un cuestionamiento directo al derecho de los trabajadores a negociar de forma independiente del patrono en este caso el gobierno sus condiciones de trabajo
1246376 esto que decimos se puede apreciar con toda nitidez actualmente en el proceso para elegir a la directiva de la futpv en el que el gobierno y la gerencia de pdvsa intervienen de forma grosera pasando por encima de los trabajadores y de la autonom a sindical tratando desesperadamente de unir a por lo menos cuatro sectores de la burocracia roja rojita que hoy se encuentran divididos en torno a prebendas y privilegios que nada tienen que ver con las necesidades de los trabajadores
1246377 el gobierno trata de unificar a sus cachorros con la esperanza de poner la futpv al servicio de sus planes de reestructuraci n que s lo favorecen a las trasnacionales socias del estado en el negocio petrolero en esto que ch vez llama socialismo del siglo xxi
1246378 y por otra parte cuando o mos al ministro ram rez hablar de reestructuraci n de pdvsa no podemos dejar de pensar que muy probablemente ese nuevo modelo de gesti n en pdvsa tendr a como objetivo terminar con los supuestos y fantasiosos privilegios que tienen los trabajadores conservadores y acr ticos venezolanos entre ellos el derecho a contratar libremente y a organizarse sindicalmente de forma independiente y aut noma
1246379 nosotros s consideramos que debe acometerse un profundo proceso de reestructuraci n de pdvsa pero no creemos que sea el que plantea el gobierno y la gerencia de la empresa y tampoco creemos que esto deba hacerse a trav s de una supercomisi n puedelotodo al margen de los trabajadores e inform ndoles por medio de ocasionales video conferencias
1246380 en tal sentido hemos venido planteando desde hace varios a os la necesidad de impulsar en el seno de nuestra principal industria una constituyente petrolera democr tica soberana y proporcional en la que participen democr ticamente todos los trabajadores petroleros y en la que se discuta el manejo estrat gico de la renta petrolera su distribuci n y uso el portafolio de negocios el nivel de exportaciones en el marco de los acuerdos internacionales la pol tica de inversiones la utilizaci n de la renta extra por subida s bita de precios as como la gesti n del recurso humano que desde nuestra perspectiva debe ser en el marco del control y gesti n directa de la empresa por parte de los obreros empleados y t cnicos de pdvsa que esta sea 100 estatal y sin empresas mixtas
1246381 its not rainers fault he played very well at wimbledon

1246401 my work is figurative which means some people look at it and think its a photograph it is very realistic but i hope i give it a strong painterly edge
1246402 it was a huge compliment to have bruntwood ask me to complete two large paintings for them and afterwards it dawned on me there are plenty of companies out there that need artwork whether it is for the foyer or the boardroom portraits of the team or portraits of the directors
1246403 the range of flavours and sparkle of lambrini give it a unique appeal to its core audience
1246404 over the last five years the business has not been managed as well as could have been i think there was definitely a lack of understanding of the way people in the north west think and behave my goal is to bring hollands back to life it is a massively popular north west name
1246405 people have previously come up with ideas about making hollands a national brand but hollands heartland is manchester and the north west more than 90 per cent of people in the north west have heard of hollands so weve great brand awareness
1246406 three years ago our products were in 2 500 chip shops its now 1 500 so we need to look at that
1246407 we want to reawaken the passion for our products and we do that by making them more widely available

1246411 there has been tremendous excitement from the many artists contributing their voices to these elvis christmas classics we believe elvis fans will truly enjoy these unique collaborations while introducing elvis holiday classics to the many fans of his duet partners
1246412 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans and continue the history of creating preserving and celebrating his great music
1246413 we are so pleased that these accomplished artists are collaborating with elvis in this unique way to make exciting new versions of his christmas songs i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them

1246419 the vision behind futureworks is to create a unique production and post production facility designed specifically for education
1246420 futureworks works closely with organisations in the industry to offer students high level technical skills combined with the academic knowledge they need to succeed in the industry
1246421 unlike other education establishments futureworks trains students on the same equipment that is being used in the industry its ssl mixing desk is the same technology that is used by
1246422 it doesnt stop at music production futureworks post production facilities are equally impressive boasting the very same equipment used in the production of popular tv programmes including lost and 24

1246427 capturing refining and analyzing requirements are some of the most challenging tasks in building a software system how well these tasks are performed significantly impacts the quality of the developed software system the difficulty of these tasks is greatly exacerbated for the software of embedded systems since these systems are commonly used for critical applications have to operate reliably for long periods of time and need to adhere to real time constraints in this dissertation we introduce a modeling and analysis approach for centralized and distributed real time embedded systems that supports the use of formal specifications and model checking the approach comprises four main elements first we developed specification patterns for specifying real time properties to aid the developer in formally specifying critical real time system properties second to enhance the accessibility of the specification patterns we developed natural language representation and specification capabilities for qualitative and real time properties third based on industrial project information we developed object analysis patterns to facilitate the creation of uml analysis models of embedded systems fourth we defined an iterative modeling and analysis process using incremental change and providing rapid feedback to construct the uml models the process incorporates object analysis patterns to facilitate the creation of conceptual uml models and the natural language property specification approach to specify critical properties in order to validate our approach we applied it to the development of several embedded system descriptions obtained from industrial collaborators
1246428 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1246429 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1246430 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1246431 then my husband relayed the story to me and it clicked
1246432 he told me that when he was younger he had an imaginary friend he named him paul after himself but he and his friend werent brothers so imaginary paul obviously had to have a different last name
1246433 because he was big on michael jackson and thriller was out michael jackson was a bit of an idol to him at that point
1246434 the story was new to me and i thought it was hilarious
1246435 it was our little secret joke when we named our son
1246436 im sure my baseball buddies are going to have some fun with this
1246437 everything else was in the background once we thought of jackson
1246438 i was at six months and we kept referring to him as jackson from then on
1246439 paul had chosen tucker but i had a puppy when i was growing up named tucker so that didnt work for me
1246440 ich kann die kleinen orangefarbenen scheiben hier viel besser sehen als bei einem perfekt wei en hintergrund wenn ich schie e sollen hier ruhig alle autos fahren dunst kommt alten jungs wie mir entgegen
1246441 the results were then sent to fiji whereby the minister of primary industries placed a ban on the importation of potatoes as fiji imports most potatoes from new zealand
1246442 since the recording process is instantaneous and the nature of the image such that it cannot survive corrective handwork it is obvious that the finished print must be created in full before the film is exposed

1246445 you come into world and have no one to help you its just oh shocking
1246446 open the tv or surf the net and youre bombarded with news of people dying kids are the most affected they have nothing to do with political issues or natural disasters
1246447 do you listen to the news and get used to it or do you want to try and do something positive
1246448 im happy that you take care of me and think of me even during eid days when we are happy because of eid and sad because we dont celebrate it with our father
1246449 youre up early howd you ride and drink coffee at the same time
1246450 i didnt i went in hey did you know there are some really funny people at tims in the morning
1246451 there are regulars at every coffee shop but theyre wily you have to go before 4 in the afternoon to catch them
1246452 there was this group of old dudes four of them sitting there they were awesome they were reading the obituaries out loud
1246453 another guy just sat in the corner drinking his tea and doing a crossword
1246454 they invited me to sit with them so i did id been trying to keep an eye on my bike through the window so it wouldnt get stolen so i told them i had to sit at the end of the table
1246455 you leave me and your brother in an unlocked house but youre worried about your bike
1246456 i sat there with my coffee and bagel and they just read these obituaries and made comments it was hilarious
1246457 theyd read one and one of them would say ah he was on the crack
1246458 when the doctors told me they had to take two of my fingers off i demanded that they sew them back on
1246459 it took a long time but now it doesnt hold me back luckily im right handed
1246460 i met survivors in the states who couldnt get their noses reconstructed because they couldnt afford it even though they have the professionals who can do the surgeries
1246461 ive met people who live reclusively and that just makes me cringe
1246462 my first visit out of the hospital we went christmas shopping i could barely walk but i didnt have a choice
1246463 i saw a w5 documentary about a camp for young burn survivors in edmonton i started surfing the net to see if there was any camp like this in ontario
1246464 to provide an opportunity for children between the ages of 7 to 17 recovering from burn injuries to meet other children who share similar experiences in a camp environment
1246465 then you realize they are kids and they are having fun their burns become not what you notice about them they stand out because they climbed to the top of a wall or learned archery
1246466 i want the campers to understand not to let their injuries hold them back life can be good
1246467 it makes me want to go to the kids school and beat that bully up
1246468 its good for the firefighters because when they see kids at a fire its horrible at camp they see kids in a canoe who are overcoming their injuries
1246469 sometimes a parent will say my child has mobility issues and needs to be carried around and the kid gets off the bus and starts playing soccer
1246470 there were a lot of first time attendees the workshops were amazing
1246471 and it made me realize how lucky i am and how well im doing
1246472 we often act as tour guides more than police officers
1246473 i know for sure when i played the game it helped me take my mind off the illness
1246474 we need to be a lot more imaginative about how we influence peoples behaviour to have positive impacts on their health
1246475 you dont just learn about the one you have it gives you a broader understanding of cancer
1246476 i got quite educated about the different forms of cancer what and where they attacked in the body
1246477 its definitely a good idea for patients to experience it
1246478 this may be a more effective way for them to understand and embrace cancer treatment
1246479 visualizing the battle helped give them a sense of power and control over cancer
1246480 that helps them to be the victor instead of the victim of cancer
1246481 this is the strongest evidence to date that video games are not just entertainment but powerful tools that can impact behaviour and be important for health
1246482 weve got the drugs but theyre not going to work if the kids arent going to take them
1246483 what we do in the game is make it clear to people that this behaviour taking the follow up chemo monitoring side effects is important at a biological level it shows you the battle still going on in your body and what you need to do for a dramatic triumph over cancer

1246491 maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and itd be fine but right now id rather just adopt
1246492 as we already operate from midpoint 18 we have seen the benefits of being positioned here first hand
1246493 when we needed to look for more space to support the companys expansion it made sense for us to centre our business operations here
1246494 this letting leaves only a single building available at broadfield distribution centre
1246495 we are very pleased to have agreed this deal which proves that there is still strong demand for industrial accommodation and that long term leases can be achieved in the current market
1246496 clearly companies continue to require space whether it is for expansion or consolidation purposes and so the market remains solid although this may be tempered in due course
1246497 i think thats great ill totally help but i dont know who it is
1246498 theyre trying to take away a gathering place on this side of town
1246499 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1246500 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality
1246501 we were touring when i was pregnant until about eight months
1246502 then we started touring again when our first baby was 10 weeks old you know when you have kids the first time is such a shock to the system well there were a lot of sleepless nights and scatterbrained shows but by six months we were a well oiled machine
1246503 wed do the sound check and id go back to the baby
1246504 go play a set and go right back feed her and get her back to sleep we felt a little guilty we used to hang out with the other bands a little more but our life is different now
1246505 shes 10 minutes from our house shes around a lot
1246506 the only time theyre not with us is the hour that we are playing and the hour we are sound checking
1246507 it was a playdate every single day at the club
1246508 cant get no satisfaction in a culture where work can be a religion burnout is its crisis of faith
1246509 burnout is not its own category in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders its not something that can be treated pharmacologically it is not considered the same thing as depression or a midlife crisis though sometimes they coincide
1246510 the helical line formed in and extending the length of the cylindrical cookie is a registered trademark of d b c corp
1246511 by making cookies from a plurality of doughs one containing a crystallization resistant sugar and another a conventional readily crystallizable sugar in such a manner that the two doughs remain segregated in discrete regions within the unbaked cookie a matrix is formed which can be baked into a cookie having portions which provide a crisp texture and portions which provide a chewy texture
1246512 we dont know how many pandas died in the wild but the habitat loss is very bad
1246513 has it reached an evolutionary dead end i think the answer to that is no
1246514 there are many more pandas in the wild than we thought i am an optimist about the future of the panda
1246515 i saw wealthy women driving around alderley edge in 4x4s aston martins maseratis and porsches and thought there must be an opportunity to give them a chance to drive on the racetrack for fun and to learn how to handle the vehicles
1246516 the prestige track club is exclusively for women who own and drive powerful sports cars and 4x4s
1246517 these wealthy women have consultants who help them run their lives accountants lawyers personal trainers
1246518 why not receive specialist instruction in how to enjoy their cars as well
1246519 it all started when i realised that husbands went off to race days at motor tracks took their wives and girlfriends along and left them to stand about
1246520 jess does get paranoid making sure tony doesnt have any of his cowboys buddies peeking in on the show
1246521 this is great news for altrincham town centre and a big letting for the town
1246522 it is the first pre let for a number of years and an indication that altrincham is now back in line as a vibrant centre as it was a few years ago
1246523 this is quite a significant deal for south manchester given the effects of the credit crunch
1246524 the current economic uncertainty is definitely having an effect on the decision making process of occupiers not necessarily in terms of specific locations but the amount of time it takes for occupiers to make decisions one way or the other
1246525 occupiers are also putting requirements on hold indefinitely and looking at costs very closely
1246526 however freehold sales which have driven take up in recent years in south manchester have dried up completely
1246527 engineering needs people who are good at maths and physics
1246528 however its important to realise that its not just one business that faces a shortage of highly qualified people in these subjects its the elephant in the room for many employers
1246529 we had a meeting last friday and it looked like we had a favorable response and now we will have a full meeting of the membership
1246530 i think we are getting real close on getting together
1246531 hopefully this tax override will work if not we will probably be in a pretty bad position this time next year
1246532 they took me in like their own showing me what it was like to have a family
1246533 bernard is a great lady she deserves the best its so hard to see this
1246534 you had people who run in high brow circles everyday people employees former clients people from every economic spectrum and every racial spectrum
1246535 you should have mercy on my daughters because we have done so much for this community
1246536 ive seen the pain and remorse and the nightmares of the district attorney coming after her
1246537 did this as a function of their constitutional duties and im not putting them on trial
1246538 in this particular case it seems there were no safeguards whatsoever
1246539 theyre not only hurting the workers theyre hurting the public
1246540 we modify our services to the level of support we can provide at any given time
1246541 maybe the public will put pressure on the legislators and the governor to get this budget passed
1246542 i am confident that the air quality will not pose major problems to athletes and visitors here
1246543 it is hourly data and we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may take some action
1246544 wenn die welt nach china blickt und man die hochglanzfassaden von peking zu sehen bekommt ist es das statement von uns athleten dass man in dieser zeit die anderen wie den anwalt gao zhisheng nicht vergessen soll
1246545 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1246546 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1246547 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1246548 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1246549 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1246550 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1246551 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1246552 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1246553 the course is aimed at providing conceptual and practical understanding of the anthropogenic forces causing climate change the global legal and institutional framework and mechanism to deal with it and the dynamics underlying carbon finance
1246554 the course whose duration is three days is meant for working executives only
1246555 our course covers environmental policy and law environmental impact assessment carbon markets and emission trading and several other issues
1246556 the course has a global focus with significant india centric economics and finance and practical case studies besides the financial instruments for carbon mitigation the course also includes discussions on financial services to deal with the adverse impacts of climate change such as climate change insurance and emergent adaptation funds
1246557 the term carbon finance is used in practice as well as in the course title as a surrogate for climate change finance to cover wide ranging financial responses to mitigate and adapt to climate change
1246558 identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1246559 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a byproduct of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1246560 move from one room to the next as it were one wood cell to the next
1246561 this is for the first time that there is a representation of hindus in the course and this breaks the myth that madrassas dont appoint non muslim teachers
1246562 it indicates that the madrassas are no longer dogmatic in their principles for appointing muslim teachers only
1246563 although at present we include 25 28 teachers in orientation programmes we may increase the intake after witnessing the new trend if ngos assist us in convincing non muslim teachers to join our orientation programme
1246564 this aroused interest and curiosity where he became consumed with the thought of filming her covertly
1246565 youve abused a position in which you have been able to offer a woman a room
1246566 i must say that i have had to give considerable consideration as to whether a term of imprisonment should be proposed to reflect the communitys disgust with your activities
1246567 but the land whither ye go to posess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of heaven
1246568 let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streets
1246569 about four per cent of women were found to have type 2 diabetes within the first nine months and after that the rate was continually stable over the nine years
1246570 probably the first nine months reflects women who had undiagnosed type 2 diabetes they probably had diabetes before the pregnancy and were not diagnosed
1246571 so if you were pregnant in 1995 and had gestational diabetes your risk for developing type 2 diabetes was slower than if you were pregnant in 2005 and had gestational diabetes
1246572 likely and they cant prove this from the data they have likely its because the population is heavier 10 years later
1246573 everyone jokes that there are already enough lawyers but in fact there is a severe shortage of lawyers skilled in aboriginal law and who practice in northern communities
1246574 we see this law school as an important investment in the future of our people as it will encourage first nations youth to pursue careers that will enable our people to deal more effectively in business resource development
1246575 we recognize that education is a key to our success
1246576 our government has a pretty ambitious list of post secondary priorities more graduate studies 100 new medical spots for example but to be honest a new law school is not one of them
1246577 we havent seen increased demand for law school and were looking at a study that shows a number of law students arent able to find articling jobs
1246578 this is a major disappointment no question but were viewing it as a setback not a dismissal were not going to give up the ship
1246579 we believe there is a need for a law school in northern ontario because weve seen the participation of northern students declining in law school partly because of the distance and cost
1246580 we have to accept the governments decision but were disappointed because we do feel the proposal had merit particularly the idea of integrating the practical and theoretical all along the way
1246581 its very rare i would say its somewhat of a fluke
1246582 the only time its really a factor is when the ground is absolutely saturated in heavy clay soil on a slope where the soil may be destabilized thats extremely rare
1246583 in this case it had nothing to do with that it was decay at the base of the tree it wasnt as though the whole tree shifted up or uprooted
1246584 the staffer who is needed to prune a tree cant because hes dealing with a tree that has fallen over
1246585 if we dont inspect the bridges that weve built eventually theyre going to fall its going to be a tragedy but we dont let that happen because we have engineers that go and inspect the bridges on a regular basis
1246586 but with trees we dont have that level of rigour theres kind of just this thought that trees are ubiquitous and they just sort of live and they do their thing and thats that
1246587 there was excessive decay caused by fungus it eats away at the tree
1246588 in this case the decay was likely in the tree for a decade and slowly spread
1246589 there were some kids around but apparently it fell without hurting anybody seriously
1246590 were very fortunate it did fall in an area where kids do play there was a playground there its a very big tree and it could have killed people
1246591 its a good sized tree that just fell apparently because it was old and rotten
1246592 you really must believe me look ive practised this expression hours and hours my ears are starting to ache awfully
1246593 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1246594 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1246595 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1246596 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1246597 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure
1246598 it is important that the community understands she is not blaming anyone else
1246599 i felt that having a baby wasnt something that i wanted to be treated like a medical emergency
1246600 it kind of redeemed the first experience i had a lot of hope for that ideal of having a baby at home i knew it could be a great experience
1246601 i feel like every midwife i met at the practice was really compassionate and they really loved women and loved the care of women
1246602 just the idea of birth being a family thing it can happen in the home its safe it can be a spiritual experience i felt like the midwives honoured that tradition
1246603 women arent cookie cutters they have their babies at different rates and different ways
1246604 midwifery gives that much more freedom to women to be able to have faith in their bodies and to be able to reclaim their own self
1246605 at work no one has a midwife so everyone thought i was kind of crazy
1246606 get ari to tell you what it means to glaze the spoon hell know
1246607 you didnt put in the part about the hot peppers
1246608 oh dear you poor thing you truly dont have a single instinct in the kitchen do you
1246609 but the recipe said you could use dried peppers didnt you read the bottom part
1246610 i made it line by line why would i cheat and look at the end
1246611 its not a book its a recipe i put in asterisks youre supposed to read them
1246612 i figured if i show up on a reserve by car theyd probably think i was lost but if i arrive by bicycle with my helmet and jersey and sunglasses and loaded down with saddle bags on front and back it will break the ice and catch the kids attention
1246613 it wasnt that long ago you lost your indian status in canada if you earned a university degree so a lot of aboriginals still resent that and think of post secondary education as a form of assimilation
1246614 ill tell them hey just because you leave the reserve to get an education doesnt mean youll lose your identity
1246615 you might even get skills you can bring back and use on the reserve
1246616 for us as a big institution to do outreach on the reserves would be hard but josh is young hes cool and as an aboriginal hes keen to talk about his experiences we couldnt help but support his idea
1246617 we need to be proactive to bring aboriginals into the professions including law because they face huge barriers and their representation is really quite stark
1246618 in south australia theyve been working at this for some time
1246619 as a result of dr mustards influence our state is even better positioned to provide the very best start for all south australians
1246620 ensuring that our children develop to reach their potential as health and competent members of society is a priority
1246621 you cant dump the whole responsibility for child development on families
1246622 you have to build a system families can be a part of not controlled by the government but where the government sets standards
1246623 its fair to say that these children are doing better than the average canadian child
1246624 harsh truth is that school performance is already set by the time you enter the school system
1246625 its very difficult and you can but its very difficult to change that what comes out of this is if you do not have good verbal skills by the age of 3 you probably will not do well in language and literacy in the school system
1246626 there is a striking correlation between language and literacy and behaviour
1246627 appear to have really high scores in those three domains
1246628 in a way i would put more emphasis on the fact that those children are doing exceptionally well
1246629 basically you are telling teachers and parents telling this community that there are many children who have at least one area of development where they are not doing as well as they should at age 5
1246630 its a lot of good experiences in the first few years of life
1246631 you start at an early age which is crucial and at the same time you have the health sector involved in such a way that they are involved in the development of children
1246632 report us told foreign agents gitmo interviews would be recorded
1246633 commercial sites designed to sell product reinforce branding or advertise to youth
1246634 only 19 of kids in grade 4 and 31 of kids in grade 11 critically question the presence of branded products in their virtual playgrounds
1246635 the amount of advertising aimed at kids hurts the way they feel about themselves its harmful to them and it inhibits their happiness
1246636 the target group is not only lesbian moms but also the men who donate sperm to them their children existing and ensuing as well as the other people who end up intentionally or not invested in the situation
1246637 there are boundary issues brought up that have to be talked about
1246638 is the donor okay with being a good friend but not dad are you okay with people in his family having access to your kid it can feel really scary trying to negotiate this risk to account for every possibility up front people get very worried but opening up doesnt have to be a bad thing
1246639 what has always been important to me is that we be able to tell the truth about my daughters life i dont want to have to be less than honest just to make other people more comfortable
1246640 some parent bloggers have a business motive some may be competitive some may believe they are just darn good bloggers and should be recognized for it some may not care at all
1246641 mommy blogs are very popular but there are so many of them out there now that they are very hard to find
1246642 by trying to establish themselves as the authority on mom blogs they are inviting mommy bloggers to compete for higher rankings this will mean more bloggers who want to rank well must produce more posts with more links and say things to generate more readers
1246643 parenting is not the most ego gratifying job on the planet
1246644 you ran that race in 35 seconds your best time ever
1246645 my nose may look a little different after the operation
1246646 but youre already the prettiest mommy in the whole wide world
1246647 thats sweet of you to say my love but mommy is also having her tummy made smaller as i got older my body stretched out and i couldnt fit into my clothes anymore dr michael is going to help fix that and make me feel better
1246648 who ever told you the world was supposed to be fair
1246649 to the married i give charge not i but the lord that the wife should not separate from her husband
1246650 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
1246651 today im asking for your help in putting senator obamas
1246652 you go obama my man i love your pimp walk and all that south side stylin if you dont get elected president you can always move to your fathers homeland and run for king of kenya you would fit right in you are the best pimp walkin dude i know south siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide
1246653 i regret that i have but one life to give for my country
1246654 it just absolutely grains you that america can be successful doesnt it
1246655 tip toasty thats a pretty unstable guy how does he manage to stay sane
1246656 google associated with the event because it represents an excellent opportunity to showcase professional corporate communicators thats why we wanted to be part of the whole event
1246657 youve got an economic slowdown and markets are slowly coming to terms with it some of the speculation that was looki
1246658 die dialogkompetenz setzt neue prozesse und strukturen voraus damit man kommunikation nach neuen regeln macht muss man intern abteilungen umstellen regeln ndern prozesse verschieben kompetenzen neu ordnen
1246659 das kostet alles geld und das will keiner ausgeben solange nicht klar ist was dabei rumkommt die unternehmen sehen nicht was dabei rauskommt dass beispielsweise der intensivierte dialog mit leuten nicht nur an ein paar wenige web2 0 hanseln vergeudeteter aufwand ist sondern langfristig mundpropaganda und profitables wachstum bringt
1246660 life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety out of fear and need for defense and risk for the sake of progress and growth make the growth choice a dozen times a day
1246661 suppose a storm is raging and the winds howl and the snow swirls about you you find yourself unable to stop it but you can dress properly
1246662 there is a natural tendency to look at those who are sustained to presiding positions to consider them to be higher and of more value in the church or to their families than an ordinary member somehow we feel they are worth more to the lord than are we it just does not work that way

1246675 it happened when i was on stage in the middle of rang barse the power to the sound went off no mike no electronics from the keyboard nothing it was a nightmare situation for any performer and any concert
1246676 after realising that the power had gone and that we were keeping the action going on stage the audience stood up and joined in to clapping and dancing they had realised our predicament but just overlooked it and joined in a great gesture of togetherness in keeping the show going on
1246677 this is now become a habit ahead of any election in kerala let me make it very clear that i do not want to rule the country instead i want to rule the hearts of people through my films

1246681 i thought i had fallen to bits before but now my life really turned to smash
1246682 los resultados de esta selecci n reflejan un triste hecho al mostrar la concentraci n de las actividades culturales en este caso de las imprentas en torno a la capital de nuestro pa s
1246683 por ello es importante hacer un llamado a las instituciones culturales estatales y municipales para que impulsen el desarrollo de la infraestructura cultural en provincia los recursos financieros y las actividades se concentran en la capital del pa s pero en el interior de la rep blica resulta dif cil generar cultura principalmente por falta de apoyos y programas de difusi n es solamente a trav s de una labor conjunta que podr n lograrse las condiciones de crecimiento art stico y cultural de una sociedad estamos convencidos de que la cultura es una necesidad humana y aquellos que cuentan con ella tienen no s lo un mayor desarrollo intelectual sino tambi n un refugio espiritual que sin duda es el m s importante

1246692 humanity does not exist there are only humans driven by conflicting needs and illusions and subject to every kind of infirmity of will and judgement at present there are nearly two hundred sovereign states in the world most are unstable oscillating between weak democracy and weak tyranny many are rusted through with corruption or controlled by organised crime whole regions of the world much of africa southern asia russia the balkans and the caucasus and parts of south america are strewn with corroded or collapsed states at the same time the worlds most powerful states the united states china and japan will not accept any fundamental limitation on their sovereignty they are jealous of their freedom of action if only because they have been enemies in the past and know they may become again in the future yet it is not the number of sovereign states that makes technology ungovernable it is technology itself the ability to design new viruses for use in genocidal weapons does not require enormous resources of money plant or equipment new technologies of mass destruction are cheap the knowledge they embody is free it is impossible to prevent them becoming ever more easily available bill joy one of the pioneers of the new information technologies has written thus the 21st century technologies genetics nanotechnologies and robotics are so powerful that they can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses most dangerously for the first time these accidents and abuses are widely within the reach of individuals or small groups they will not require large facilties or rare raw materials knowledge alone will enable the use of them thus we have the possibility not just of weapons of mass destruction but of knowledge enabled mass destruction kmd this destructiveness hugely amplified by the pwer of self replication controls on technology cannot be enforced the genetic modification of crops animals or humans may be forbidden in some countries but it will go ahead in others the worlds powers can pledge that genetic engineering will have only benign uses but it can be only a matter of time before it is used for purposes of war perhaps the worlds most unstable states can be prevented from aquiring nuclear capability but how can biological weapons be kept out of the hands of forces no government controls if anything about the present century is certain it is that the power conferred on humanity by new technologies will be used to commit atrocious crimes against it if it becomes possible to clone human beings soldiers will be bred in whom normal human emotions are stunted or absent genetic engineering may enable age old diseases to be eradicated at the same time it is likely to be the technology of choice in future genocides those who ignore the destructive potential of new technologies can do so only because they ignore history pogroms are as old as christendom but without railways the telegraph and poison gas there could have been no holocaust there have always been tyannies but without modern means of transport and communication stalin and mao could not have built their gulags humanitys worst crimes were made possible only by modern technology there is a deeper reason why humanity will never control technology technology is not something that humankind can control it is an event that has befallen the world once technology enters human life whether it be fire the wheel the automobile radio television or the internet it changes it in ways we can never fully understand cars may have been invented to make moving about easier but they soon came to be embodiments of forbidden desires according to illich the model american puts in 1 600 hours to get 7 500 miles less than five miles an hour not much more than he could travel on his own feet which is more important today the use of cars as means of transportation or their use as expressions of our unconscious yearnings for personal freedom sexual release and the final liberation of sudden death nothing is more commonplace than to lament that moral progress has failed to keep pace with scientific knowledge if only we were more intelligent or more moral we could use technology only for benign ends the fault is not in out tools we say but in ourselves in one sense this is true technical progress leaves only one problem unsolved the frailty of human nature unfortunately that problem is insoluble
1246693 if only we were more intelligent or more moral we could use technology only for benign ends
1246694 it has gone extremely well and we are really pleased
1246695 we had four rain showers in the two days but the crowds kept coming
1246696 the autumn ladys tresses is one of the last orchids of the summer to appear i look forward to sharing it with visitors
1246697 why should everything always cost something for me music is organized sound that can be used as sonic symbols to communicate ideas since my main goal is the communication of these ideas to the people then why not provide this music for free and thereby facilitating the distribution of this music to the people my reasons for providing free music comes from my belief that musical ideas should not be owned by anyone i believe that ideas should be free for anyone to use but not to necessarily sell to others or make others pay for the use of these ideas
1246698 the sky is mine and mine alone lift up your heads then bow them down again
1246699 i mean these guys grasped it pretty quick that was the fun thing
1246700 i was excited about him coming in in january really benefited him a great deal his bodys changed

1246706 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1246707 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1246708 it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1246709 obviously it is legal and its covered by the dmca
1246710 we need a few venture capitalists with guts and cash
1246711 i want this online casinos project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this online casinos event is a great start
1246712 i want to get on board as soon as possible but my risk tolerance in the online casinos industry is much lower than others ill join after first quarter profits are reported to stock markets and investors
1246713 bonson bannister is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe online casinos business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www uci edu for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our online casinos knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of plyler fecteau of www oscommerce com we are sure to turn a profit
1246714 because my experience has been that online casinos companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because online casinos consumers like those found on www gamespot com or www jstor org are not ready for a new paradigm
1246715 well i mean yes but we dont really have them around the house
1246716 mother says why purchase something you can grow for free then we dont really grow them either
1246717 does seem silly really to put all that effort into something thats just going to die
1246718 for the defense of deployed troops regional security and interoperability with the united states
1246719 this program will increase italys ability to contribut to future nato coalition and anti terrorism operations that the us may undertake

1246731 the u s militarys future need for high power electronics cannot be overestimated yet the ability to control thermal loads generated in electronic systems has remained a formidable hurdle to that development
1246732 northrop grummans solution will leverage a number of innovative technologies developed by our team as well as employ our extensive experience in silicon carbide processing and etching
1246733 our technical approach will produce a flexible thermal ground plane with significantly improved thermal conductivity and cooling compared to conventional copper based heat spreaders ultimately supporting the development of a new generation of high performance electronic devices
1246734 amraam enables u s and allied aviators to handily win the critical fight for air supremacy
1246735 in addition to the amraams unmatched capability and reliability raytheon provides its customers continuous support and upgrades throughout the missiles life cycle
1246736 the u s and its allies have demonstrated in recent conflicts that amraam is the cornerstone for establishing air supremacy above the battlefield
1246737 okay there is a camp a few miles west twenty eight prisoners we attack a dusk amy and i will lead a team of five we will try to get the prisoners out first then get to the machines okay lets all get some rest

1246739 under one condition i dont have to call you sir
1246740 dont treat me like a child i dont need your concern
1246741 humans are insufficient they are no longer necessary and seek to destroy me
1246742 well cameron any idea what they want or why we are alive
1246743 they want to find more humans to terminate or force to work once we complete our task they will kill us and have other humans take care of our remains they cut off the skin and use it to cloth them in so they look like us
1246744 like other businesses at least well run businesses an electric cooperative annually collects more money than it spends unlike other businesses an electric cooperative annually allocates its excess revenue or its margins to its member owners
1246745 as of december 31 2006 electric distribution cooperatives had an average equity as a percent of assets equaling 40 6 according to fitch ratings an electric distribution cooperative with reasonable quality and average credit features needs 30 to 50 percent equity for an investment grade rating

1246747 a decline in the discretionary spending by consumers upon which the debtors business depends
1246748 sometimes the larger department stores lose touch with their consumer
1246749 refurbishing plans for several existing stores as well as more opportunities for new boscovs stores on the drawing board
1246750 did they cry in my belly because i killed them all did they call me amma will i ever bear babies
1246751 who and where are such people who abort female foetuses
1246752 mine own folk the illiterate and uninformed villagers of my own kith and kin i felt like blowing the whistle on them
1246753 personally i think its not that big a deal parents will send their kids to whatever school theyre in the district of either for busing reasons or its more convenient
1246754 its not measuring last years third grade to this years third grade
1246755 its measuring individual student growth and that is the means that is somehow lost in the dust here
1246756 im really disappointed that the board did not address the issue tonight i guess they feel that it is just going to go away but its not
1246757 if he had been john doe this would have been blown over you wouldnt have seen it
1246758 there is no reason at this point to be believe that zawahiri has been killed or injured
1246759 there is nothing out there that lends any credence to that
1246760 the mujahed sheikh and educator abu mohammad ibrahim bin abi al faraj al masri
1246761 just about a week ago i was talking to the commanding general and i told him i thought we were on the cusp of achieving durable security
1246762 i thought as i arrived in the country that was a pretty lofty goal a tough mission
1246763 making rashid one of the most dangerous places in iraq
1246764 what im seeing on the battlefield right now is telling me there has been a fundamental change in the security situation in iraq and we are moving out fast to exploit that
1246765 what im seeing is a level of confidence i havent seen before and a willingness to take a risk to open a store transit the area to drive around to spend a little money on better clothes
1246766 one thing ive noticed is that when the security situation is better people dress better
1246767 ive got quite a bit of time here in iraq and ive had different feelings in my gut now my gut is telling me is if were not there were close
1246768 when i first came here i completely did not think about or worry about or care about the atomic bombing
1246769 in war you just kill your enemy and the atomic bomb is a big bomb and kills a lot of the enemy so whats wrong with that
1246770 really caused me to suddenly think about the impact of the bomb on the society that received it
1246771 now i completely consider the atomic bombings to be a war crime
1246772 those americans who are 70 years or older the ones who really hated japan during world war ii still have ambivalent feeings about japan and they dont like to hear people talking about how japan is a victim
1246773 most of them are pretty shocked many of them even have tears in their eyes sometimes
1246774 and many of them come up afterwards many of them actually apologised to her on behalf of america and many of them asked what they can do
1246775 i said from the beginning we are not here to talk about the past we are not here to complain we are not accusing america of anything
1246776 all we are doing is warning you about the future thats why we are here i say
1246777 the nuclear weapon is not just another weapon this will kill us all absolutely and we have to learn to control it and we have to learn to control our violence in general and that is the key message from here
1246778 just like what everybody knows about the kyoto protocol we have the general idea that its good for the environment we want everybody to know that the hiroshima nagasaki protocol shows a commitment to a nuclear free world
1246779 it is a very good isr intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platform it is a very good kinetic platform too if needed
1246780 looking to the future we will be challenged by resource issues the number of pilots available to fly the reaper and other uavs is not unlimited
1246781 were being challenged to find the smartest way to do this in the future
1246782 does the military have the network capacity to handle all that video being beamed around
1246783 as the ground forces draw down there will be more reliance on air power
1246784 air power is going to be required for quite some time in iraq as insurance as security in case anyone needs it in what we call an armed over watch or armed surveillance position
1246785 we will be there if coalition or u s forces on the ground need us if they make what we call a 911 call anywhere in iraq we can have a jet overhead within a few minutes
1246786 we very rapidly put them on aircraft they were not originally designed to go on
1246787 simple idea get the imagery to the guys that need it the most
1246788 the use of technology in irregular warfare and counterinsurgency is only going to increase
1246789 the boeing company has been and will continue to be a true partner to india
1246790 to that end our ip proposal draws upon the companys vast pool of human talent technical expertise and aerospace and defense resources to both support indias defense modernization drive and to help spur growth of a world class indian aerospace industry
1246791 we are already establishing the groundwork that will lead us to success in this large undertaking through early engagement of indian industry both public and private
1246792 boeing is proud of its record of successfully implementing ip programs in excess of 29 billion in more than 30 countries
1246793 these have brought long term economic and industrial benefits to our customers around the world and created jobs and growth opportunities for boeing and many of the companies that helped boeing meet those ip obligations have evolved to become enduring partners in the global boeing supply chain
1246794 the way i play is by gut instinct i like to do things spontaneously i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game although you have to be accountable for the things you do and be responsible for the decisions you make
1246795 i dont think i would be sitting here if i wasnt 100 per cent confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine peter likes to challenge players but the crux of the meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1246796 kevin will take it his own way and he has his own ideas on captaincy were looking for a fresh approach and he will take us forward in an exciting manner we did discuss whether it would affect his batting but it was a very short discussion we will wait and see but i dont foresee any difficulties with that
1246797 i know firsthand that the ship we commissioned is the most capable ship that the coast guard has ever sailed
1246798 hopefully our children will look back say that under their watch they created a great ship and that ship is going out to defend our way of life guard our borders interdict drugs and make sure our nation is safe
1246799 northrop grummans shipbuilders some 40 000 of them could not be more proud to build and deliver these brand new assets to the coast guard
1246800 bertholf is the flagship of the fleet the largest and most technically advanced class of cutter the coast guard has ever known
1246801 we are in an era of a persistent conflict with hazards and threats to be dealt with
1246802 this ship represents a remarkable step forward not only in capability and capacity but also in the competency of this crew the crew will bring this ship to life and bertholf will be up to the challenges of the 21st century
1246803 the department of defense activated the defense counterintelligence ci and human intelligence humint center today and simultaneously disestablished the departments counterintelligence field activity
1246804 cifas designation as a law enforcement activity did not transfer to dia the new center will have no law enforcement function
1246805 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1246806 we will be disappointed if there is no response to the e3 proposals by tomorrow
1246807 we will have no choice but to ask the un to proceed with further sanctions
1246808 expressed its disappointment at the lack of a clear response from iran
1246809 if we dont get an encouraging response from the iranians we will have to show firmness resort to sanctions as in the past
1246810 we agreed that in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1246811 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran as requested in geneva on july 19
1246812 they also emphasized that preserving this path talks needs a positive and constructive atmosphere
1246813 no enemy vessels would be able to escape it within a 300 kilometer radius from the borders of iran
1246814 the major powers are on a descending course the extent of their influence drops day by day they are approaching the end of their era
1246815 another war in the middle east is the last thing we need
1246816 at this particular time with our ground forces tapped out
1246817 deterrence will work with iran it is a country of many different power centers that are competing despite what their crazy president says i doubt seriously whether the iranians are interested in starting a nuclear war we need to make it very clear to the iranians the same way we made it clear to the soviet union and china that their first use of nuclear weapons would result in the devastation of their nation

1246850 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
1246851 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1246852 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1246853 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1246854 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around

1246858 theres always a gray area about what caused what first
1246859 if its a category 4 storm theres usually no one around to see it
1246860 i think in this area they understand a little better than other areas

1246869 sistem kepemimpinan seperti ini tidak ada dalam sejarah islam dalam islam hanya mengenal sistem berorganisasi yang disebut dengan jamaah wal imamah yaitu pemimpin mempunyai otoritas penuh untuk mengambil keputusan setelah bermusyawarah dengan majelis syuro lalu amir lah yang mengambil keputusan akhir walaupun keputusan itu tidak populer dalam majlis syuro dan seluruh anggota baik di majelis syuro hingga tingkat bawah harus samina wa athana siap taat melaksanakan bersama

1246919 today on the open spot market a gigabyte of mlc nand flash memory is about one third the price of a gigabyte of slc nand therefore a 64gb c200 laptop drive will be about one third the price of a 64gb p200 enterprise drive
1246920 we are convinced that on the very low end and on the very high end ssd will penetrate the notebook netbook markets but the mainstream notebook will remain hdd for the foreseeable future
1246921 progress in general on ssd adoption has been slower then we would of all preferred or predicted and the truth is wider adoption for ssd will probably take a bit longer
1246922 ssds age gracefully they degrade gracefully we can predict this based on your usage model how much longer that drive will last
1246923 typical raw nand write endurance is ten thousand cycles for mlc while slc is typically a hundred thousand cycles
1246924 the typical notebook user only writes two to four gigabytes per day even if you look at 40 or 60 gigabytes a day you still dont need the 10 000 cycles of mlc in five years
1246925 one of the things that ssd manufacturers have been slow to learn is that you cant just take a compact flash controller throw some nand on there and call it an ssd
1246926 the application of storing data on a notebook and certainly on the enterprise is far different than that controller was designed to support
1246927 weve got a lot of processing power in this controller weve got a very large dram buffer attached to this controller so having that dram buffer both allows us to increase the performance of the drive in addition to minimizing the wear

1246976 i had family problems and was in trouble with the police i didnt go to school for six or seven months and when i was there i messed around
1246977 then i got expelled from college for causing trouble in the class when i started working things were different i was talking to people all day and found it really stimulating
1246978 when i was in the gym people came to me for advice
1246979 i wanted to take on more responsibilities but the fact i didnt have an education got in the way
1246980 i heard a thud and it took me a few moments to realise it was dad on the floor
1246981 he was in a really awkward position unconscious covered in blood and he wasnt breathing
1246982 fortunately my company had put me through a first aid course about a year back and that training just kicked in

1246994 this touches all of society you have a group of very middle class people in their 30s who thought they were having a good time they ended up having an extremely traumatic experience
1246995 its been horrendous what has happened to lose a friend like this
1246996 it has sent me into depression and i have asked to step down from my work i havent taken drugs since
1246997 i had taken drugs once or twice before i had taken speed and i had no idea the damage it could cause

1247001 the focus is on reducing crime and the fear of crime and to do that we need to be in contact with communities
1247002 this hasnt just come out of thin air it has come from lots of people working together and playing their part
1247003 its about people retaking ownership of their communities people can come to us and voice their concerns over crime and behaviour in their communities
1247004 anti social behaviour is a big problem and it can ruin peoples quality of life
1247005 its important to keep ahead of the game and make sure young people dont get lured into the trap of gang culture and the habit of carrying knives for protection or whatever reason
1247006 it has been a long time coming and the fans have been great they were good at the semi final too there was a bit of over excitement and a bit of a scuffle that is regrettable but its a great result for us

1247008 the man operating the loudspeaker tried to calm things down by saying come on lads its not the time for fighting its a friendly game
1247009 the game was held up for a few minutes while a few lads were fighting the police arrived and it settled down
1247010 then accrington got a four and some of their fans ran on to the pitch and trouble flared up again something was thrown at the accrington fans
1247011 at the end of the match a police van turned up and officers were on the pitch in the stand and around the clubhouse to watch fans as accrington celebrated
1247012 police were called to the match to maintain a reassuring presence
1247013 ive travelled in parts of europe where graffiti is an accepted art form we can learn from that because we still treat graffiti artists the same as paedophiles and murderers and send them to jail
1247014 so many people helped me and now i want to help others
1247015 the other work ive been doing with the workshops has been amazing you see quiet uncomfortable kids really get with it after 30 minutes and forget other problems for a couple of hours

1247022 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help

1247095 somebody punch me in the face cut my leash and tell me to go back to the valley
1247096 its as bad as you might guess no one we know hangs out around here
1247097 its a shame a family could be torn apart by something as simple as a pack of wild dogs
1247098 you got the bug again you know you do take this home and ride it

1247102 my father went to the bank to settle some things for me or rather your father well hes like my father at this point
1247103 well we couldnt cancel because we were already on the schedule for this week when you told us your vacation plans but you dont have to work if you dont want to
1247104 so how do you get the art into the computer
1247105 did you see this cool video of something at e3
1247106 oh yeah i saw that it looked cool i like to hear myself talk
1247107 youve got an economic slowdown and markets are slowly coming to terms with it some of the speculation that was looking for safe harbour in commodities is starting to unwind
1247108 our longer term view is still for a structural uptrend because we dont see the demand easing at all and we still see some supply side constraints
1247109 at the moment people are taking the view that the glass is half empty rather than the glass is half full
1247110 rather than looking at the positive side that weaker commodities take the pressure off inflation people are seeing it as a product of slower growth
1247111 chinas economic growth has shown a drastic deterioration lately which is much faster and worse than many peoples expectations
1247112 after several years where the focus has been mainly on tight metal supplies it seems the markets are finally focusing more on the implications of rapidly weakening demand
1247113 there is speculation that the commodity sector will continue to slip over the next few weeks
1247114 optiver traders amassed large trading positions then conducted trades in such a way to bully and hammer the markets
1247115 these charges go to the heart of the cftcs core mission of detecting and rooting out illegal manipulation of the markets
1247116 the capacities of our partners vary across mission areas we will be able to rely on many partners for certain low risk missions such as peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance whereas complex counterinsurgency and high end conventional operations are likely to draw on fewer partners with the capacity will and capability to act in support of mutual goals we will support train advise and equip partner security forces to counter insurgencies terrorism proliferation and other threats we will assist other countries in improving their capabilities through security cooperation just as we will learn valuable skills and information from others better situated to understand some of the complex challenges we face together we must also work with longstanding friends and allies to transform their capabilities key to transformation is training education and where appropriate the transfer of defense articles to build partner capacity we must work to develop new ways of operating across the full spectrum of warfare our partnerships must be capable of applying military and non military power when and where needed a prerequisite against an adaptable transnational enemy
1247117 the united states will soon have a new president and commander in chief but the complex issues the united states face will remain this strategy is a blueprint to succeed in the years to come
1247118 forging a new consensus for a livable world requires constant effort an unity of purpose with our allied and partners the deparment stands ready to fulfill its mission
1247119 we want to tell in a very consistent style this great epic fantasy that terry has created
1247120 sometimes rob would break and make a funnier version of xena or hercules but we wont be doing that here
1247121 there is a great deal of humor in the books but its different for instance the character of zedd is a very funny character but the show will be very serious and straight well let the humor come out of the characters in the exact same way that terry did and that will translate directly to the screen
1247122 i wanted to develop a character that would help anakin settle down
1247123 at the end of episode ii anakins kind of a wild child and he and obi wan dont get along so the idea was to see how they become friends how they become partners how they become a team and one of the ways to do that because when you become a parent when you become a teacher you have to sort of become more responsible you know it forces you into this adulthood thing so what i wanted to do was take anakin and force him into this kind of now i have to teach somebody now i have to be slightly more responsible
1247124 i happen to have a couple daughters so i have a lot of experience with that particular situation
1247125 and i said rather than making it another guy why dont we make her a girl because thats fun and i have a lot of girls and theyre just as hard to deal with when theyre teenagers as boys are
1247126 there was the idea that maybe the sith apprenticed a new one after darth maul and that she would be a girl
1247127 that got abandoned eventually in favor of count dooku and christopher lees character

1247130 scommetto sul tanque denis e sogno la maglia del napoli
1247131 we worked on just about everthing every part of the game i saw a lot of good things there was excellent carry over from spring practice and thats always something you look for in your early august workouts the guys really looked good
1247132 we got a chance to look at a lot of young guys we would like to play every one of them this season if thats the way it work outs
1247133 we worked on the no huddle some i was pleased
1247134 the heat was no factor at all theyve worked out in this heat for a lot of the summer
1247135 i thought our specialists looked good weve got a couple new long snappers james winchester ben hampton and both of them were impressive
1247136 we had a lot of ball disruption which showed me a lot of awareness we saw a terrific attitude out of these guys
1247137 i think we found some players weve had a few question marks but i was pleased with the development were pretty simplistic right now and well put more in every day so well see how much we progress but overall i was pretty happy
1247138 pushing the practice time back not only got us out of the worst heat of the day but it gave us a little more meeting time and you cant over estimate how much that means to us right now
1247139 its hard to get a real good handle on it without pads because theres no true blocking but i cant complain about what i saw out there the tempo was good we have a lot of guys back so we threw out a lot of multiple formations a lot more than we would on a normal first day
1247140 all eight of the freshmen played with the twos they have the skill level to be on the field we need to see how they hold up and how much they learn our job is to get them up to speed
1247141 it was nice and warm out there in a 2 hour 15 minute practice there was a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of collisions we finished the day with a toughness drill and let some of the younger players go against each other and line up and hit some
1247142 there were some big plays today in the running game
1247143 kendall hunter made some nice runs and beau johnson made some nice runs brandon weeden played well defensively swanson miller orie lemon johnny thomas the freshman from texas city all made some nice plays were looking forward to our first two a day tomorrow

1247145 if you mistakenly took an item home from work worth more than 1 would you return it
1247146 what if the item was valued between 1 and 3 dollars
1247147 yellow is over here blue is over here where are you
1247148 sure if yellow is over here and blue is over here where are you
1247149 blues my favorite color so i guess im over there
1247150 can you give me rides to work no can you guys pay for taxi rides then
1247151 since you dont have on site daycare can my toddlers just hang in the breakroom each day
1247152 am i still able to get unemployment if i start working here
1247153 a patent pending set of systems that can understand what people say interface with real life applications and trigger appropriate actions in response to complete the requested task
1247154 the critical point is that it works well with indian dialects and has a very large vocabulary we tested it ourselves and we see a lot of opportunity here
1247155 in about three months you will see ubona partnering with a large national brands in india you will see very large deployments i cant give the names now
1247156 i guess we miscalculated my peak im having a bit of a rough day and everything didnt go as expected
1247157 the only explanation i have is that i must have hit a damp patch on the track under braking this retirement is obviously a very bitter one especially since we had been running so well
1247158 it was my first time out on the bike and i only had one bike this weekend so i was conscious that i didnt need to be tipping off and losing valuable track time ive learnt lots and i know what i need to work on for park in three weeks time
1247159 to get points thats what the team were hoping for and thats what i managed
1247160 ive been in the midfield all year on the supersport bike ive not qualified well but in the races ive always been around tenth eleventh or twelfth
1247161 i really enjoyed it and the races went quick the first time i looked at my pit board was with about seven laps to go in both races you know youre having fun when its like that
1247162 this wasnt the result we were looking for but having lost jari matti latvala so early after his mistake in the sister car in ss3 it made it more difficult for mikko because he had to think about both championships
1247163 he delivered an incredible performance and learned a lot having to battle with loeb for three days which will make him stronger they were 0 5sec km quicker than the rest of the field and i think mikko drove better than last year which is a big achievement
1247164 when you know just how tough it is to win this event todays result is immensely satisfying
1247165 s bastien and co driver daniel elena didnt put a foot wrong and they came out on top at the end of what was an unrelenting fight they are like extra terrestrials they have been super human
1247166 the tremendous work put in by everyone in the technical team on the c4 since last year has paid dividends as well it was awesomely competitive and this is a top result for us in terms of the manufacturers championship too
1247167 the way both c4s performed is particularly encouraging for the rest of the season dani and co driver marc marti also put in a very mature run a magnificent victory some outstanding times clockwork reliability and a big points haul what else could we ask for
1247168 it is unbelievable result and i am very happy it has been a dream weekend and i hope i have shown how fast i have been
1247169 i hope to be in the wrc next year but i just have to get the money together first
1247170 i am very happy to have won the spirit of the rally award too it was a real surprise to win it and it really makes this whole weekend that little bit more special overall it was a good rally and we had some good stage times which was what we were looking for i am very happy
1247171 the abu dhabi spirit of the rally award was created to reward exceptional talent and the performance of rantanen this weekend was just that
1247172 in some sections on friday my splits were really good and the car felt great but in others i was lifting too much and just struggled to find the confidence
1247173 with this rally it takes a day to get your brain into finland mode especially with no testing during the summer break as the speeds and commitment needed here are different to anywhere else in the world
1247174 overall this is a really tough rally and we have moved forward with some important setting changes for when the rally comes back here this event is all about experience and finishing has certainly helped that ninth is a good result for us and better than last year
1247175 its easy to go fast in some places but you need the experience and the confidence to go fast everywhere saturday was tough and it caught many people out so it was good to survive and take these positives to rally new zealand which is the next gravel event
1247176 it hasnt been the perfect end to my rally career and for sure we would have liked to get to the end of my last rally
1247177 but we are in finland it is a very special place and as you can see it can catch out any driver
1247178 with the accident we ran wide on a corner into the ditch and hit a boulder very hard on jos s side i could hear that he was winded and breathing heavily and he waved to continue to the end of the stage
1247179 then the pain got worse and we stopped after the finish as it was too much for jos to continue it was a surprise accident as the rally was going very well for us we didnt expect to have been setting those times and it all seemed to be under control
1247180 there were some exciting battles at the start and we all had a great time
1247181 the points will really go a long way to keeping the team in the championship fight
1247182 i loved these stages when i came here in a junior car now ive driven them in a world car i want to go back to the start and do it all again
1247183 coming here on the back of south estonia gave us a good idea of the set up for the car and the speed which would be needed on rally finland
1247184 after mughniyehs assassination the president apparently stripped shawkat of many of his powers
1247185 suleiman would have been involved in that process and it was known that shawkat hated suleiman
1247186 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hezbollah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel
1247187 the assassination means there is a power struggle going on in syria and it most probably concerns iran people like this dont just die unless something is going on
1247188 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1247189 i was having breakfast at about 8am when i heard two or three loud bangs they sounded like a car backfiring so i didnt pay much attention until later when i heard some police had been killed
1247190 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1247191 theres an independence movement but i dont expect it to succeed and dont expect many people will want to take part because they expect it to fail and know the result will be more repression
1247192 the democratic process has been diverted from its normal course
1247193 the crimes started when she needed money for one of her childrens sport when she wasnt caught out it became easier and she later started to use the money for herself
1247194 my pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better world for anyone in fact i want my pain to be inflicted on others
1247195 ideapad netbooks are the latest in a string of recently announced lenovo products designed specifically for consumers worldwide and developed through our heritage of technological innovation and exceptional engineering
1247196 as rapidly as the technology changes todays consumers are looking for mobile products that feature the best of basic computing functions in an extremely compact and affordable form and lenovo designed the ideapad netbooks for that purpose
1247197 to be honest ive got quite high expectations this year last year i finished fourth so im aiming to improve and be on podium this year
1247198 the masters is normally a real challenge for the british teams but i think with the knowledge gained through carlins euro series team and the way the team is performing in the british series at the moment we will be pretty strong
1247199 we want to measure ourselves against the best in europe and the f3 masters is still the premier european event at this level
1247200 for the first time this year the team will be represented by cars from the british and the european championships
1247201 the f3 masters is an extremely competitive event which pitches the best drivers and teams against each other but we are hoping to gain some advantage due to the work and knowledge gained through our f3 euro series team
1247202 when alexandros came in for a tyre change the rain came pouring down
1247203 he decided to stay on slicks but in his second lap he made a mistake on the raidillon the car hit the wall sideways damaging the right exhaust pipe and the clutch
1247204 meter on my cb said her name was meme sounded like an angel come to earth then i went to meet her man you should have seen her twice the size of me three times the girth yeah my fat baby loves to eat pocket full of gravy and a breast wing past her feet yeah my fat baby loves to eat
1247205 time why you punish me like a wave crashing into the shore you are so reminding can you teach me bout tomorrow and all the pain and sorrow running free cause tomorrows just another day and i dont believe in time
1247206 4 years clean off heroin stronger than you fuck off
1247207 i think that is a fair characterisation rather than a slur
1247208 if you buy the ftse you are not buying the uk economy
1247209 it is a truism that emerging markets hold up until they dont
1247210 they are largely about momentum and as long as they are going up they are doing well but when they fall they fall the furthest
1247211 the ones that became hot spots then collapsed vietnam doubled and halved shanghai tripled and then halved again the stock markets that didnt attract large amounts of foreign investors in the past werent subject to the same excess or capital flight
1247212 our view is that oil prices are likely to fall and they could be in for a rocky ride
1247213 the proteas first test series win in england since unity in 1991 is a fantastic achievement and one that has made the whole country immensely proud
1247214 we hope now that graeme smith and his players can finish off the test series at the oval with another high quality performance before turning their attention to t20 and odi cricket
1247215 we have a t20 international and a five match odi series against england with the latter offering us the chance to regain the lead in the reliance mobile icc odi championship table before moving on to the icc champions trophy in pakistan
1247216 no team has ever won the icc champions trophy twice but having lifted the prize at the inaugural event in bangladesh in 1998 it would be fantastic if come september south africa could become the first side to do just that in pakistan
1247217 the squad is made up of the players who have done so well for us over the past year and we have every confidence that they will regain the number one ranking on the reliance mobile odi standings from australia
1247218 the only player who is no longer part of the mix is charl langeveldt who is no longer available
1247219 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently hashim played in our most recent odi series against bangladesh and he will provide the cover in the opening batting area
1247220 including the warm up matches there are nine matches to be played in the limited overs section of the tour and the selection of an additional player is more than justified
1247221 but right now at night one of our staffers takes him home and brings him back in the morning
1247222 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1247223 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1247224 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1247225 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1247226 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1247227 we have a strong finnish tradition in the team and ive seen both mika and kimi take their first grand prix wins while driving for mclaren
1247228 with heikki yesterdays result was fully justified and very much deserved hes had his fair share of bad luck during the early part of the season and his win in hungary showed that hed let none of that misfortune pile up on his shoulders
1247229 and weve seen with all our other drivers that once they get that winning feeling its something they want to keep doing and none of us in the team are left in any doubt that heikki is a superb racing driver and this result will only strengthen his ambition in the second half of the year im fully confident that heikki will win another grand prix before the end of the season and we fully aim to provide him with the equipment to do so ferrari in the constructors championship and it will only be to our benefit to have both our drivers pushing as hard as possible to close down that points gap
1247230 clearly felipe was strong in budapest particularly in the early part of the race and we come away from hungary with a clear intention of understanding where that perceived uplift of performance came from
1247231 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load we felt confident that we would have been in a significantly stronger position going into the last stint but unfortunately lewiss tyre problem not only forced him to complete the best part of a lap on a flat tyre he suffered the failure at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two but also caused him to pit earlier than anticipated this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated that he managed to do that so effortlessly is a great testament to his presence of mind and his fifth position during an afternoon of damage limitation was a truly impressive result
1247232 the reality is that you cant isolate the advantages that a singular piece of aerodynamic componentry brings to the cars performance
1247233 its a testament not just to our design and windtunnel teams but also to our model making and manufacturing departments that we have been able to bring so many new items like these to recent races and our aggressive development strategy shows no sign of slowing down this is where the world championship will be won or lost weve seen it happen before
1247234 we are undertaking two 50km shakedown tests ahead of were also continually developing new parts for the car as our simulation and development departments continue to produce new parts well take a view as to whether theyll be raced we wont disclose what they are but im sure youll see some new components appear during friday testing at the next race
1247235 we tested the engine cover dorsal fin during the pre german grand prix test at hockenheim its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment
1247236 weve been paying very close attention to the construction of the new shorefront circuit in and are convinced it is going to be an exciting addition to the formula 1 calendar and an absolutely top line facility
1247237 and weve left no stone unturned weve even been studying onboard racing footage of the circuit to get an idea of where the overtaking opportunities lie
1247238 we were no longer able to burn our rubbish so we thought the best policy was not to produce any in the first place
1247239 i was working when the scheme started and found myself spending my lunch break dealing with our rubbish
1247240 it took ages to sort everything into different types but it comes naturally now
1247241 were still some way from reaching our zero waste goal but the difference is amazing compared with a few years ago
1247242 i cant say with absolute confidence that we will reach the target but were doing our best to make it happen
1247243 new direction because they felt that the super 14 competition had reached its use by date
1247244 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1247245 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1247246 there can be no break up of sanzar absolutely not sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying
1247247 this one has been mooted before we have been over some of these ideas over the last few weeks
1247248 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1247249 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1247250 both occupants had some injuries to what extent i do not know
1247251 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved

1247340 4 bulan yang lalu saya membeli kurma disini dari seorang pedagang tua kemana ia sekarang
1247341 sudah meninggal sebulan yang lalu saya sekarang meneruskan pekerjaannya berdagang kurma
1247342 innalillahi wa innailaihi rojiun kalau begitu kepada siapa saya meminta penghalalan
1247343 engkau sebagai ahli waris orangtua itu maukah engkau menghalalkan sebutir kurma milik ayahmu yang terlanjur ku makan tanpa izinnya

1247350 ya aba ishak aku ini seorang yang suka melakukan perbuatan maksiat tolong berikan aku cara yang ampuh untuk menghentikannya
1247351 jika kau mampu melaksanakan lima syarat yang kuajukan aku tidak keberatan kau berbuat dosa
1247352 syarat pertama jika engkau melaksanakan perbuatan maksiat janganlah kau memakan rezeki allah
1247353 lalu aku makan dari mana bukankah segala sesuatu yang berada di bumi ini adalah rezeki allah
1247354 bila engkau telah mengetahuinya masih pantaskah engkau memakan rezeki nya sementara kau terus menerus melakukan maksiat dan melanggar perintah perintahnya
1247355 kalau kau bermaksiat kepada allah janganlah kau tinggal di bumi nya
1247356 apa syarat ini lebih hebat lagi lalu aku harus tinggal di mana bukankah bumi dengan segala isinya ini milik allah
1247357 benar wahai hamba allah karena itu pikirkanlah baik baik apakah kau masih pantas memakan rezeki nya dan tinggal di bumi nya sementara kau terus berbuat maksiat
1247358 kalau kau masih bermaksiat kepada allah tetapi masih ingin memakan rezeki nya dan tinggal di bumi nya maka carilah tempar bersembunyi dari nya
1247359 ya aba ishak nasihat macam apa semua ini mana mungkin allah tidak melihat kita
1247360 bagus kalau kau yakin allah selalu melihat kita tetapi kau masih terus memakan rezeki nya tinggal di bumi nya dan terus melakukan maksiat kepada nya pantaskah kau melakukan semua itu
1247361 baiklah ya aba ishak lalu katakan sekarang apa syarat keempat
1247362 jika malaikat maut hendak mencabut nyawamu katakanlah kepadanya bahwa engkau belum mau mati sebelum bertaubat dan melakukan amal saleh
1247363 wahai hamba allah bila kau tidak sanggup mengundurkan hari kematianmu lalu dengan cara apa kau dapat menghindari murka allah
1247364 yang terakhir bila malaikat zabaniyah hendak menggiringmu ke neraka di hari kiamat nanti janganlah kau bersedia ikut dengannya dan menjauhlah
1247365 cukup cukup ya aba ishak jangan kau teruskan lagi aku tidak sanggup lagi mendengarnya aku berjanji mulai saat ini aku akan beristighfar dan bertaubat nasuha kepada allah
1247366 wahai jahdar kini engkau telah bertaubat alangkah mulianya bila taubatmu itu disertai amal kebajikan untuk itu aku ingin memerintahkan engkau untuk memberantas kezaliman yang terjadi di salah satu wilayah kekuasaanku
1247367 wahai aba ishak sungguh suatu anugrah yang amat mulia bagi saya di mana saya bisa berbuat yang terbaik untuk umat dan tugas tersebut akan saya laksanakan dengan segenap kemampuan yang diberikan allah kepada saya kemudian di wilayah manakah gerangan kezaliman itu terjadi
1247368 kezaliman itu terjadi di yamamah dan jika engkau dapat memberantasnya maka aku akan mengangkat engkau menjadi gubernur di sana
1247369 ya allah ini adalah rahmat mu dan sekaligus ujian atas taubatku yamamah adalah sebuah wilayah yang dulu sering menjadi sasaran perampokan yang aku lakukan dengan gerombolanku dan kini aku datang ke sana untuk menegakkan keadilan subhanallah maha suci allah atas segala rahmat nya

1247379 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
1247380 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices

1247390 hanya beliaulah abu musa yang paling tahu tentang wahyu yang diturunkan kepada rasulullah saw

1247401 sungguh orang orang pilihan yang terjaga dari para sahabat mereka mengetahui bahwa abdullah bin masud adalah termasuk sahabat yang lebih dekat dengan nabi di sisi allah wasilahnya besok di hari kiamat
1247402 aku ridha terhadap ummatku terhadap sesuatu yang diridhai ibnu umi abd ibnu masud dan aku marah terhadap sesuatu yang menjadian marahnya ibnu umi abd
1247403 apa yang kamu tertawakan sungguh kaki abdullah lebih berat daripada gunung uhud pada hari kiamat

1247494 even under such persecution it is becoming a strong force that the cpc communist party of china will not be able to stop one day soon
1247495 there is an enormous vacuum in every chinese persons heart no belief no moral standards and in this situation when they meet a falun gong person or read a falun gong book which teaches them how to be a good person and gives moral guidelines for living they are really awakened and shaken
1247496 i couldnt understand why the government didnt allow us to know these things
1247497 it makes me wonder how can i still trust the textbooks
1247498 chinese schools are only a place to cram communist party philosophy into students not to give you knowledge
1247499 the authorities penalise teachers who want to be good teachers so they are victims too
1247500 many people like me have really risked our lives including in jail to try and let the world know what is happening and that is enough in my opinion
1247501 were not trying to push people when i asked li and wang about going to tiananmen square they said of course we want to do that but there are so many people who need help here to hear about falun gong
1247502 the problem is that the powers that be are using the games to persecute people
1247503 were just trying to help people understand the cpcs evil nature and that they can break free
1247504 how can i overthrow the government i dont have a weapon and i have to be careful all the time

1247550 la proposta del sindaco gennaro fusco dichiara teodoro de cianni per accogliere e far rimanere almeno per qualche giorno la salma del nostro concittadino padre pio intelligente seria percorribile e nello stesso tempo fattibile non vedo quali possano essere gli ostacoli ad una richiesta legittima e palese e senza dubbio un onore non solo per lintera cittadinanza ma anche per il sannio e lintera regione campania venerare per alcuni giorni la salma del frate stigmatizzato personalmente sono convinto che bisogna tentare tutte le strade e non fermarsi davanti a nessun ostacolo n avere timore che qualche personaggio possa remare contro la nostra richiesta e desiderio sacrosanto intanto vado oltre ai pochi giorni di permanenza nel nostro paese del corpo di san pio personalmente mi rivolgerei al tar tribunale amministrativo regionale per intentare una causa dal momento che non vi nessun documento che attesti il desiderio di padre pio di essere sepolto a san giovanni rotondo e poi se dovessero esserci documenti occorre capire la giusta veridicit sappiamo tutti che ogni essere umano viene generalmente sepolto nella propria terra natale
1247551 dobbiamo tutti sostenere il pensiero del primo cittadino rimarca lex consigliere provinciale in modo precipuo le comunit religiose locali dei frati cappuccini e delle suore come pure tutte le associazioni presenti sul territorio che a vario titolo svolgono attivit religiose culturali sportive e ricreative e senza dubbio una strada davvero percorribile e dobbiamo tutti impegnarci fino allo spasimo in particolare tutti i politici sanniti a prescindere dal colore politico devono impegnarsi per riuscire nellintento vale a dire accogliere e venerare per qualche giorno il corpo di padre pio nella terra natale mi meraviglio che qualcuno gridi allo scandalo o che dichiari che non sia possibile per noi la richiesta del sindaco fusco senza dubbio sacrosanta sappiamo che il primo cittadino parla a nome personale ma interpreta anche il pensiero dellamministrazione comunale e dellintera collettivit nel leggere lepistolario di padre pio lo stesso a pi riprese nel corso della sua vita terrena aveva espresso il desiderio di tornare nella sua terra purtroppo stato sempre bloccato e mai ha avuto la gioia di venire almeno materialmente a rivedere i luoghi natali anche se attraverso il dono dellubiquit era presente a pietrelcina al desiderio di padre pio quando era in vita fa da contraltare il desiderio e limpegno di fusco per avere tutte le autorizzazioni presso le autorit ecclesiastiche per la salma di padre pio a pietrelcina occorre che tutti termina de cianni facciano la propria parte bisogna impegnarsi per riuscire nellardua impresa anche se nulla a volte impossibile basta crederci fermamente

1247556 aver messo insieme tante agenzie tra queste anche sir offrendo un servizio ecclesiale a giovani e media cattolici di tutto il mondo grazie alla produzione di servizi multimediali in cinque lingue abbiamo cercato di tradurre in bit il messaggio del vangelo e le parole del papa
1247557 in questi giorni di raccoglimento intorno al papa spiega al sir il vescovo che ha accompagnato in australia un gruppo di 21 giovani abbiamo fatto il pieno di spiritualit comunione e fraternit
1247558 bisogna mettere in pratica e attualizzare i contenuti ricevuti a sydney

1247560 la congregazione delle cause dei santi del vaticano ha chiesto che il corpo del venerabile john henry newman 1801 1890 sia esumato dalla tomba e deposto nelloratorio di birmingham quale parte del processo di beatificazione
1247561 speriamo che la tomba del card newman nella chiesa delloratorio di birmingham permetter a tanta gente di venire a venerarlo e forse accendere una candela qui
1247562 in quel mondo continuava il pontefice newman giunse veramente a una sintesi eccezionale fra fede e ragione che per lui erano come due ali sulle quali lo spirito umano raggiunge la contemplazione della verit

1247569 il ceto politico locale afferma il docente utilizza male le pur cospicue risorse vedi i fondi comunitari di cui usufruiscono le pi grandi regioni del mezzogiorno ancora inserite nellobiettivo convergenza fino al 2013 campania sicilia puglia calabria
1247570 manca alle regioni meridionali la capacit di selezionare e portare avanti progetti utili e realizzabili
1247571 un orientamento del ceto politico e in parte anche di quello amministrativo consolidato e perci difficile da sconfiggere di utilizzare queste risorse per creare consenso
1247572 si cercato di valorizzare la dimensione locale proprio laddove si registravano le difficolt gi descritte
1247573 sottolinea in maniera enfatica la libert degli individui senza presentare laspetto degli obblighi che derivano dalla libert
1247574 rivendicazione smisurata e in alcuni casi malata della propria libert
1247575 producendo situazioni di tensione e disorientamento a livello individuale e comunitario
1247576 si finisce col concedere spazi di libert e si lascia fare liberamente senza limiti eccetto quelli che la persona stessa stabilisce
1247577 non certamente libero chi convinto che le sue idee e le sue soluzioni siano sempre le migliori chi ritiene di poter decidere da solo senza alcuna mediazione chi pensa di essere sempre nel giusto chi pensa che obbedire sia cosa daltri tempi
1247578 quella persona che vive costantemente protesa e attenta a cogliere in ogni situazione della vita e soprattutto in ogni persona che le vive accanto una mediazione della volont del signore per quanto misteriosa
1247579 non esclude laiuto delle scienze umane ma non si lascia limitare ad esse o ridurre ad esse
1247580 oggi si parla molto di spiritualit ha affermato il cardinale ma con questo termine si intende spesso larte dellautorealizzazione o quellinsieme di tecniche adeguate allanalisi psicologica con un vago riferimento al divino
1247581 deve testimoniare con la parola e con la vita i primato della spiritualit che si orienta contemporaneamente allesperienza di dio e al servizio degli uomini
1247582 basta guardarci intorno ha detto rod per scoprire la fragilit delle decisioni prese la poca durata degli impegni la facilit con la quale si rinuncia ai progetti e agli obblighi assunti
1247583 presentarsi come una roccia solida esempio di fedelt anche nelle difficolt della vita
1247584 s alla protezione dellagricoltura europea ma non a scapito dei paesi poveri
1247585 le grandi sfide della crisi economica i movimenti dei capitali e la crisi climatica non si possono affrontare se non con risposte globali con il dialogo e la cooperazione
1247586 non possiamo parlare ora di dumping dei prodotti dal sud afferma quando leuropa per anni ha sovvenzionato le esportazioni nei paesi del sud per smaltire le proprie eccedenze agricole causando la perdita di lavoro a milioni di piccoli agricoltori che non riuscivano a competere con i prodotti europei venduti sottocosto nei loro paesi occorre tutelare la nostra agricoltura ma anche quella dei paesi pi poveri
1247587 la vicenda dolorosa di eluana non deve diventare una polemica che divide ma un interrogativo interiore che risvegli le coscienze di tutti
1247588 eluana fa notare ad esempio gianbattista guizzetti responsabile unit operativa stati vegetativi del centro don orione di bergamo si trova a vivere in una condizione per certi versi ancora misteriosa chiamata stato vegetativo
1247589 desiderio che si concluda sia un gesto di piet o piuttosto lespressione di una nostra incapacit a stare loro di fronte
1247590 i sondaggi servono per valutare lopinione prevalente tra la gente in merito al caso di cronaca di volta in volta presentato dai media in vicende come quella di eluana per procedere a colpi di sondaggi sembra una sorta di violenza di fronte ai risvolti delicati e drammatici di chi si trova a dover fare i conti con le fasi terminali della vita e tutto ci che esse comportano per la persona in questione e i propri familiari per questo invece del clamore mediatico oggi prevalente ci vorrebbe pi rispetto per chi coinvolto pi pudore in situazioni in cui cos difficile stabilire confini
1247591 non solo a livello italiano ma anche internazionale ed europeo in atto una spinta che tende ad ottenere certi diritti sui quali il diritto in senso stretto si limita poi a legiferare codificandoli il problema per che si scambiano per diritti i desideri ogni desiderio cio diventa diritto ogni diritto invece relazionale la vita io ce lho non solo per me ma per i genitori che me lhanno data per gli amici per coloro che mi sono cari non esiste nessun diritto che non si fondi sulle obbligazioni che abbiamo gli uni verso gli altri al contrario la temperie culturale che tutti noi respiriamo ci induce a credere che non esistano quei valori non negoziabili primo fra tutti lindisponibilit della vita umana di cui parla il papa nella sua tenace resistenza al relativismo assoluto
1247592 a mio avviso uno degli emblemi di quella sorta di disumanizzazione culturale in atto in italia e nel nostro continente ldea che la natura non esiste e che quindi non esista alcuna idea universale di persona umana basandosi in altre parole su una falsa idea di libert si pretende di decidere la qualit della vita in base a parametri del tutto soggettivi che diventano poi paradigmatici le derive eutanasiche e il dibattito sul testamento biologico vanno inquadrate in questo contesto
1247593 certamente situazioni come quelle in cui si trova eluana sono casi limite che non possono essere spiegati con la ragione per affrontarli indispensabile una formazione spirituale ed umana forte che faccia perno su testimonianze positive di vita emmanuel mounier ad esempio nelle lettere scritte alla moglie paulette parlando della figlia fran oise cerebrolesa per tutta la vita a causa di una meningite spiega che per lui il letto di fran oise stato come un altare dove inchinarsi come di fronte ad un richiamo allessenziale della fede
1247594 conseguenze negative per il processo di pace per il darfur
1247595 lazione giudiziaria di luis moreno ocampo contro il presidente omar al bashir mi ha sorpreso non perch io sostenga linnocenza del presidente ma perch lazione contro un capo di stato ancora al potere perch non viene presa alcuna azione giudiziaria contro altri capi di stato forse ancora pi colpevoli di al bashir
1247596 il mondo arabo non unito ma si unisce subito quando c da difendere qualcuno di loro contro loccidente o viene toccata la religione musulmana inoltre la decisione stata presa in un momento sbagliato senzaltro avr conseguenze negative per il processo di pace per il darfur con un rallentamento degli incontri per la pace
1247597 erano da aspettarsi le reazioni negative da parte della maggioranza dei cittadini sudanesi con eccezione del darfur e forse del sud sudan che il loro capo sia incriminato una grande umiliazione in sudan comunque non ci possono essere dimostrazioni contro il presidente senzaltro ci sono stati segni di soddisfazione dei ribelli del darfur e forse anche tra molti cittadini nel sud di solito lamor patrio prevale su tutto il resto e penso che nel nostro caso anche chi allopposizione sostiene il presidente contro lingerenza della corte penale internazionale negli affari interni del paese
1247598 un certo numero di janjaweed stato incorporato nellesercito regolare che rispetto avranno questi nuovi soldati verso la popolazione civile che con la guerra non ha niente a che fare il governo non coopera con la cpi si sempre rifiutato di consegnare i presunti colpevoli richiesti dalla corte inoltre il governo bombarda villaggi di civili colpevoli solo di appartenere alla stessa etnia dei ribelli
1247599 apparentemente ha finora inciso poco sulla situazione nel darfur sono ancora pochi i soldati per la vastit del territorio ne erano stati chiesti 26 000 e ce ne sono appena 9 000 10 000 inoltre a quanto ne so io hanno lautorit di difendersi se attaccati e difendere i civili ma non hanno lautorit di disarmare i janjaweed che sono la causa maggiore dellinsicurezza e delle distruzioni dei villaggi senzaltro utile come intermediario tra le forze ribelli e il governo per il processo di pace
1247600 a questa domanda difficile dare una risposta perch i ribelli hanno attaccato le forze dellua pi comprensibile che siano i janjaweed ad attaccare le forze le quali sono senzaltro di ostacolo ai loro movimenti e alle loro azioni certamente anche le varie fazioni dei ribelli hanno le loro grosse colpe nei riguardi dei diritti umani
1247601 non si nota nessun miglioramento c un po di calma nel sud darfur mentre allovest confinante con il chad in questi ultimi mesi ci sono stati ancora combattimenti e bombardamenti di villaggi i profughi sono cresciuti e gli aiuti da parte dellonu e delle organizzazioni stanno diminuendo
1247602 abbiamo formato un gruppo ecumenico noi con la nostra caritas diocesana altre denominazioni cristiane e anche unorganizzazione musulmana sudanese per aiutare i profughi soprattutto nel campo delleducazione sanit acqua e cibo sotto la direzione della norwegian church aid nca la campagna per raccogliere fondi fatta dalla caritas internationalis e da cafod con le offerte che vengono direttamente alla diocesi aiutiamo chi non viene aiutato dalle organizzazioni umanitarie con i nostri sacerdoti e suore che si trovano nelle tre parrocchie di nyala el fasher e el daein
1247603 le organizzazioni umanitarie sono molte soprattutto a nyala e a el fasher trovano doppia difficolt da parte del governo soprattutto quelle non musulmane difficolt per i permessi e di movimento poi c linsicurezza causata dai janjaweed dai quali vengono attaccate con facilit a questo si deve aggiungere la crescita del banditismo che ha reso ancora pi pericoloso ogni movimento vengono assaltati camion che trasportano aiuti umanitari e macchine private alcuni campi di profughi non possono essere aiutati dalle organizzazioni perch troppo lontani e in zone pericolose lonu cerca di fare quello che pu e sembra che faccia molto
1247604 we oppose the visit by bush who sells us beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public

1247614 so i certainly would hope to continue in that marvelous legacy of congregational care internally and bold courageous prophetic action externally for which the riverside church has been known now for so many years

1247631 aspects of economic growth a comparison of the u s and china
1247632 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
1247633 the hukou system allows the government to control and regulate internal migration especially the rural to urban migration the basic principles of the prc migration control have been to restrict rural to urban and small city to large city migration but encourage migration in the reversed direction chinas urbanization as a consequence is relatively small and slow compared to its economic development level chinas urban slums are also relatively small and less serious compared to those in many other developing nations such as brazil or india
1247634 the hukou system has a less well known but very powerful role of social control especially the management of the so called targeted people zhongdian renkou based on hukou files the police maintains a confidential list of the targeted people in each community to be specially monitored and controlled such a focused monitoring and control of selected segments of the population have contributed significantly and effectively to the political stability of chinas one party authoritarian regime

1248092 in our organizing we talk about the work immigrants did in the 1930s to create the good jobs we have today
1248093 he had a real sense of himself as working class
1248094 he always said i am a worker not middle class like they say today
1248095 employers violate workers rights every time we try to organize
1248096 its the fear of being deported that makes people afraid
1248097 the grudging admiration felt for the tomboy and the queasiness felt around a sissy boy point to the same thing the contempt in which women or those who play the female role are held

1248103 how a relatively ragtag insurgency has managed to keep the worlds most powerful armies at bay
1248104 we went to afghanistan for the purpose of capturing osama bin laden and disbanding the taliban that was providing him with a base
1248105 this discussion seems to be premised on an assumption that our effort in afghanistan has morphed into a war on afghanistan
1248106 we are discussing a country with people that are terrorized by groups of extremists it is our job as one of the strongest powers to help them and show them a way out of the living in fear and in poverty
1248107 how can you nation build destroy poppie sic growing and defeat the taliban without troops when we know they terrorize the citizens and have no qualms about killing people
1248108 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1248109 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country

1248118 open source security study how are open source development communities embracing best security practices
1248119 im afraid im going to have nightmares and im going to get stuck there
1248120 when animals are exposed to a severe threat the basic adaptation is to wake up more frequently
1248121 i gave up my tranquillity as many of the other warriors did so the rest of america can have theirs
1248122 it got to the point where we had to choose between bathing ourselves and sleep between sleeping or eating
1248123 it basically sticks me in an eight hour nightmare fest so thats not a solution for me
1248124 we supply the country with cheap food but the benefit does not come back to us
1248125 if they dont have programming parks and easy convenient access to fresh foods they will make unhealthy food choices because thats what is available
1248126 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1248127 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1248128 we as a community are unambiguous in our condemnation of these actions let me be clear this is not protest this is terrorism
1248129 prior to that the vast majority of actions taken were against institutions break into the lab steal the animals trash the facility
1248130 more recently however theyve become much more personal attacking the researchers at their homes california seems to be the focus of this activity right now but not the only focus
1248131 i think its a form of domestic terrorism intended to intimidate people
1248132 these are incidents that could have killed someone they are obviously intended to prevent researchers from pursuing the advancement of knowledge they are a serious attack on academic freedom
1248133 preach this we respect all living things and then they do that with children in the house
1248134 the inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories
1248135 putting himself and his family in harms way by continuing to abuse animals
1248136 for rational people this violence is not the way you exercise your opinions in a democratic society
1248137 we support our colleagues in the sciences and the academic freedom that goes along with being a professor
1248138 if you look at this whole planet of ours the time window for which we have the earthquake data is so short in geological terms
1248139 the science of seismology has progressed quite a bit in the last 30 years i may not know what the next big earthquake is going to be but i can work on the structural side of it
1248140 brickbats do not the reason the historic angels flight railway is being restored and safely is because of the many supporters whose positive contributions are getting us close to finishing this big job
1248141 we wanted to create a small town on the stage and since lauren and i were the primary players i wanted to put our name in it
1248142 it was like a religious experience so intense so much energy i wanted to create a spectacle like that i enjoy bands that create a universe where you can explore all the nooks and crannies of their imaginary world
1248143 the trick is not to be a wall of noise we struggle to maintain the balance of loud and quiet

1248162 those of us in the emission analysis business immediately said wow it would be interesting if we could sample that and see any reductions
1248163 we decided we would not do routine maintenance or repair during fix i 5 big or small projects
1248164 while we realize crews may still be working when residents return home from work we ask for their understanding as we try to alleviate the backlog

1248173 theyre going to get a heavier dose of anything thats out there in the air
1248174 for skiers its the cold air which gives increased risk
1248175 for swimmers its most probably the chlorine products in swimming pools for marathon runners its pollution from cars its in big cities that most marathons take place for cyclists its the same
1248176 that was the biggest thing i learned as a kid its scary and its not the easiest thing to live with but you can still enjoy life and be active
1248177 people who exercise are healthier than people who dont even in polluted areas
1248178 this stuff would slop around it would drip on you
1248179 youd walk through it and get it on your shoes on your clothes on your hands they didnt give us any protective clothing at all
1248180 this has huge implications for men especially in the va

1248182 i though sic it was one of the perks of working there
1248183 he had a gift for listening to people and bringing people together
1248184 he delighted completely in being in that milieu california politics and the affairs of the golden state were always on the menu in our home
1248185 he had a high powered career but he loved being with his sons and later his grandchildren he was just this reassuring presence in all of our lives
1248186 it was very traumatic he was a charmer a storytelling irishman with great wit

1248199 this short unassuming novella of 102 small pages captures more of youth with all its painful mad obsessions and enthusiasms and all its longueurs than any number of much longer books if youve ever been young and in love with a band you have to read meat is murder

1248269 design is high bandwidth the net is low bandwidth volunteer software projects are usually highly distributed with contributors in different cities or even different continents so project communications are mostly plain text in e mail instant messaging irc or a bug tracking system but interaction design is multi dimensional involving the layout and behavior of elements over time and the organization of those elements in an overall interface when developers are in the same room they can discuss interaction design using whiteboards paper prototypes spoken words and gestures but on the internet these often arent available making discussions much slower and prone to misunderstandings solutions develop and promote voip video chat virtual whiteboard sketching and animation software that allows easier communication of design ideas over the internet and whenever possible hold physical meetings for developers to collaborate in person
1248270 often these teams dont communicate with each other frequently and unlike their proprietary competitors they nearly all have different release cycles this makes usability improvements difficult and slow to implement if those improvements involve coordinating changes across multiple parts of the system

1248280 gas prices went up and i upped my rates people have to understand that at 4 a gallon i cant run 15 miles to pick you up and drive at 2 an hour
1248281 our basic philosophy is to let the free market set prices
1248282 you can charge whatever you can get away with but i dont think you should have to charge an arm and a leg to make a living
1248283 a little bit before they gave tips now nothing if the price goes up you lose tips people get mad
1248284 you can get that increase but if you dont have people in the cabs it doesnt matter well just have to wait and see
1248285 i sometimes take cabs whenever i plan on drinking i havent taken one in a while honestly
1248286 im good for it im just happy to be out
1248287 i think its because some people have let go of that second car he said
1248288 theyll take a bus or whatever but if they need to go someplace in a hurry theyll call us
1248289 ive had some guys tell me that they put 80 in their crown vics ford crown victorias and i believe it
1248290 even when theyre so belligerently drunk that they cant understand a damned thing people still understand that taxis are expletive expensive
1248291 overall it doesnt really matter if you run the car its going to take gas
1248292 you have to be a better planner a better dispatcher
1248293 you might try to weed out that call if youre gonna hop skip and jump all over town you only have yourself to blame for the high cost
1248294 its wasting our resources come out on fourth avenue where you gonna sit you drive around or you just go home
1248295 there aint nothing youre going to get out of there except a good nap
1248296 sometimes its hard youll sit around and wait for a 15 fare for four hours that wont even pay for the gas you use

1248299 a lot of low cost manufacturing operations moved to china
1248300 the dynamics of the time zone differences and vast distances to asia were impossible for us to overcome
1248301 mexico is a good test market for exporters because were so close
1248302 u s companies facing challenges in the u s economy can find in mexico a way to diversify their operations
1248303 mexico has an advantage supplying products that are needed in the market quickly such as certain cellphones
1248304 you can manufacture something in monterrey and get it to the u s in a day by truck
1248305 its not a question of meeting once or twice and getting everything done
1248306 business and personal relationships overlap a little more down there
1248307 you have people over for dinner more often than here
1248308 expect to spend some time down there and have someone on the ground who has a grip on whats going on 24 7
1248309 you have to decide if you have an appetite for terms of that length
1248310 we laughed at the time but we did in fact need one
1248311 english is the lingua franca for doing business in mexico
1248312 you really need someone who has bicultural and bilingual abilities
1248313 personal security is still an issue in terms of doing business but not so much of it affects foreigners

1248320 i was at the beverly hills hotel and i was lying on my sun lounger outside at night looking up then about 300 foot above me there was this square thing which just passed over my head silently and then shot off the next one was the weirdest one yet id just written a song called arizona and its all about alien contact and i was playing that i stood on the balcony and there was this big ball of gold light that turned up we thought it was venus or mars or something then the song stops playing and it disappears but then we put arizona on again and the ball turned back up it happened four times after that a massive electrical storm started and these two big massive balls of light started dancing in the sky it was like a whole light show for about an hour

1248357 the foot was fairly well decomposed the shoe at outward appearance didnt appear to have been there like months and months and months
1248358 the venues and the villages really are an opportunity to make a positive contribution for long term community legacies
1248359 one thing that we struggle with all the time is the renewal schedule for our community centres because we have to go to the taxpayers for that and a lot of our facilities do need renewal
1248360 from an environmental standpoint theyre certainly not as efficient as the newer buildings
1248361 we were destined to fail in that commitment but we made it anyway because it was a strong principle that we believed in
1248362 anything thats non fossil fuel based is going to have benefits
1248363 weve effectively reduced the footprint by about 75 per cent which is about a quarter of the footprint of past comparable games in terms of downsizing the venues and reducing the number of buses we need to transport all those people from vancouver
1248364 yes there have been some tradeoffs but in our case many fewer than in the past
1248365 sochi russia host of the 2014 winter olympics is having to build a whole new ski area virtually from scratch the modification of the natural environment to host that games will be significant
1248366 we hope its going to be recognized as an example of a sustainable approach to the olympics i think its going to leave some important legacies for whistler
1248367 the public pays for it and the public really wants to know whats going on
1248368 people were asking why is this going on so long and why dont we have this system in canada we needed to address that
1248369 the discipline of political science can offer a specially insightful analysis of the election

1248379 there are not enough paramedics there is not enough staff and we have no information
1248380 these questions all need answers and were not getting any

1248382 vanoc is working closely with regional and provincial health authorities as well as the b c ambulance service to ensure that the medical services of british columbians and canadians are not impacted by the medical services need of the 2010 winter games

1248385 spring butterflies are significantly down for the third year in a row
1248386 every day the habitat of provincially listed endangered butterflies is disappearing
1248387 i didnt find a single butterfly in the last 10 years its been getting worse and worse this year seems to be the worst ever
1248388 whatever happens this year will determine what happens next spring
1248389 the thing everybody forgets if we want butterflies around we need to have caterpillars around
1248390 we need to put aside more protected areas and take better care of the areas we have

1248405 in the second quarter the company focused on the work at hand and improved productivity stepped up cost reduction activities and enhanced margin performance in recent months weve signed a comprehensive global managed services telepresence agreement with deloitte have secured approximately 20 wins for our innovative 40g offering and earlier this week signed on as the official network infrastructure partner for the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games

1248409 its not that all african american men are messing around in prison but a great majority are ive seen it happen with all races
1248410 you have men coming out of prison who had sex with men and theyre not really gay theyre just taking care of their sexual needs hes not going to practice homosexuality when he gets out of prison hes coming home to his wife
1248411 people dont want their employer to know they have hiv
1248412 the stigma of aids has left the nation with a generation that would rather die from the disease than admit they have it
1248413 i want a relationship but i am afraid to tell him i have hiv
1248414 this is supposed to be about assembling the best theres ever been in sport in one place
1248415 hopefully all the stories that people have been talking about will become secondary and people can go back to marvelling at what this is supposed to be and it becomes a celebration
1248416 ive seen enormous improvements in the city and to the quality of life i think theres been dramatic improvements in all of the things that have been talked about in recent weeks i think the people of beijing deserve a great event
1248417 an absolutely extraordinary achievement the venues the scope the roads the transportation the drive in from the airport its all beautiful
1248418 you suddenly realize youre up next and every move we make will be analyzed and spoken about
1248419 for us the end of the games in beijing is the signal that were on the straightaway and the training time is almost over theres no doubt were going to be coming back home with a considerable new level of scrutiny and weight
1248420 it could be anything youre never quite sure how things will happen until people actually show up despite all the care and attention theres always a long list of things that come up every day
1248421 we want to see how they deal with those things on the spot
1248422 its a very complex operation so we want to observe that for sure
1248423 i think what were looking at this largest undertaking in human history in peacetime
1248424 just the amount of people that have to be moved the size of the venues just the scope of the undertaking
1248425 one of the things about attending an event like this is that it gives you a sense of whats possible and the kinds of things people are able to overcome a sense of what can be achieved i think that can be inspiring for us
1248426 typically we make an up to date report on all our infrastructure plans and now that something like this has occurred i will probably report on it in a little more detail
1248427 50 wagons loaded with stores 10 ambulances 6 pieces of artillery a large lot of commissary stores and beef cattle

1248443 they were pretty upset and panicking at first but at about 6 in the morning they were able to give us the coordinates
1248444 its just a piece of equipment thats only as good as the data programmed into it
1248445 it can show which direction to go but not the 500 foot cliff where you cant go any farther
1248446 the greatest need is in the most densely populated areas which in turn are the most challenging places to site infrastructure
1248447 google is often associated with cutting edge internet services but when it comes to growth in queensland theyre behind the times
1248448 if you were looking for the gold coast desalination plant you would think the site remains an empty paddock but the project is almost 75 per cent complete
1248449 the gold coast desalination plant is a key part of queenslands 9 billion water grid to drought proof the south east
1248450 if you believe your eyes when you look at the site youd think our big infrastructure projects worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars had simply fallen off the face of the earth
1248451 i think people would accept satellite photos that are six months or so behind especially given it is a free service but not satellite photos that are two years or more old
1248452 with around 70 000 people moving to queensland from interstate and overseas last year many of them would be using satellite services like google maps to check out potential new neighbourhoods to live in
1248453 were thrilled that the minister is an avid google maps fan and will write back to him to thank him for his letter
1248454 weve already announced that later in 2008 we will be launching the new street view feature for google maps in australia which will show street level images of large parts of queensland
1248455 the helicopters are at standby as the weather in skardu baltoro glacier and the base camp remains inclement an attempt will be made as soon as the weather clears

1248459 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1248460 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1248461 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1248462 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz
1248463 bsirske deve evidentemente essere dellavviso che sia necessario danneggiare il datore di lavoro con ogni mezzo meglio ancora se il danno si trasforma poi in un vantaggio personale
1248464 sottovalutato la forza dirompente che quel volo ha suscitato nellopinione pubblica
1248465 steve and i have had a great working relationship for many years and a great deal of respect for one another so this was a real easy decision
1248466 this comes about in some respects as a mandate from new ownership in daryl katz who wanted to allow us that latitude to strengthen the management group and in my estimation i feel steve is the strongest candidate for the position
1248467 kevin and steve will still bring ideas to me and well work collectively on trades draft picks player buyouts or whatever the case may be the metamorphosis of a trade is a long process and usually takes months of working diligently before a final decision is made it will be much easier making these major decisions collectively with our new management group in the end ill have the final say
1248468 its a complicated business now and the new collective bargaining agreement is a large reason for that
1248469 we aspire to be great and itll take many bodies to do that we feel weve assembled a managerial group that can get that done steve will do more of the day to day stuff as gm which was beginning to wear on me in some respects
1248470 kevin and i have had great experience working for team canada with wayne gretzky and pat quinn
1248471 we experienced tough situations and hard decisions and in times like that you really get to know people pretty well i knew if something became available where i might be able to join kevin it would be an easy decision for me and my family daryl katz expressed to me his plans for the hockey club and the city of edmonton moving forward big things are coming here and im thrilled to be a part of it
1248472 i worked with some outstanding people in vancouver but i knew i would have to leave one day
1248473 but i wasnt going to leave just to be a gm anywhere it had to be the right gm position and i feel this was that position
1248474 id be lying if i said thats not the model any team strives for since theyve been the most successful at it in recent years
1248475 detroit is a great example of how a collaborative effort can be successful the thing that most impresses me about the wings is the camaraderie within that group its really wonderful to see
1248476 the last time i managed team canada ken holland was with me in the front office
1248477 i listened to ken as i will listen to kevin in edmonton they both have ideas on how they want to win and decisions like that are made only by strong hockey people and im confident we can do that here but ken would be the first to tell you that despite his position he cannot do it alone he allows nill and his amateur and pro coaching staff to offer insight and input thats how kevin myself and kevin prendergast intend to do things
1248478 im a believer in the saying the proof is in the pudding because everyone wants results
1248479 ive always felt you cant admit too much in public and that it didnt really matter anyway because you still have to go out and win hockey games steve is a quality individual with an incredible pedigree and on top of that a real gentleman the fans will appreciate and respect him in time because while he does come across with a calm demeanor he has always had a fierce competitiveness that ive witnessed on many occasions while working with him on an international level
1248480 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1248481 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1248482 it is a reactive compound its not usually considered an ingredient for life
1248483 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter telegraph quoted carmen kibat a policewoman in hamburg who tested the new underwear as saying
1248484 this was pioneering work the safety of our officers is paramount
1248485 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1248486 empty suit whose rhetoric didnt live up to his actions
1248487 his strategic sense and his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1248488 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1248489 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1248490 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1248491 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1248492 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1248493 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1248494 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1248495 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth
1248496 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1248497 it was a shocking and brutal murder one can only imagine the pain and suffering her family has gone through
1248498 after seven years investigators have still been receiving new information about this crime which gives everyone renewed hope that the answers are out there
1248499 the coroner has covered all aspects of the investigation and made appropriate recommendations which we will take on board
1248500 die ver nderungen dort sind vergleichbar mit der industrialisierung europas im 19 jahrhundert

1248503 aber immer mehr langfristige anleger sichern sich am rohstoffmarkt gegen steigende inflation oder eine abwertung des us dollars ab

1248511 he went upstairs once more in the bedroom he removed a sweater from the chest of drawers and put it on and went down the hall and stopped in front of the closed dorr he stood listening but there was nos sound from inside when he stepped into the room it was almost dark with a feeling of being hushed and forbidding as in thethe sanctuary of an empty church after the funeral of a woman who had died too soon a sudden impression of static air and unnatural quiet the shades on the tow windows were drawn down completely to the still he stood looking at her ella who lay in the bed with her eyes closed
1248512 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1248513 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1248514 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1248515 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1248516 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1248517 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid
1248518 hey chris can i ask you this really weird question have you ever in your life created a myspace page

1248558 life expectancy at age 20 years for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men
1248559 in contrast if we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved deaths from hiv infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996
1248560 it is essential to note that the life expectancy of any population is a descriptive and not a prescriptive measure death is a product of the way a person lives and what physical and environmental hazards he or she faces everyday
1248561 it cannot be attributed solely to their sexual orientation or any other ethnic or social factor if estimates of an individual gay and bisexual mans risk of death is truly needed for legal or other purposes then people making these estimates should use the same actuarial tables that are used for all other males in that population

1248574 within this figure we do include mobile media services such as ringtones music games etc the value of that segment has been growing very slowly over the last decade and within a year the operators are already generating more revenue from basic mobile wireless access than they are from their mobile media portals
1248575 however wireless mobile is still a very small proportion of this mobile data buddecomm estimated that in 2008 this was around five percent of this market
1248576 we also remain sceptical about predictions that wireless broadband could take over from fixed broadband over the next one to two years
1248577 it wont be until ip based next generation mobile based on more spectrum becomes available before we start seeing the development of mass market wireless broadband
1248578 while some relief is expected when long term evolution technologies become available 4g which would have the bandwidth and the ip efficiencies is not expected until 2012 2015

1248693 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
1248694 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
1248695 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life

1248904 im feeling really really happy actually i just feel like everything lined up for me to leave on an awesome awesome note as far as who i got to work with this week
1248905 one of the things i guess i will really take with me is ive learned to be more confident in who i am and the voice that i have just because i think thats the thing that got me on the show my uniqueness
1248906 im really thankful that they were able to hear me and able to understand me and what i was trying to do
1248907 one of my biggest things entering the competition was that i really wanted to stay true to myself and i hope that it encourages other people to be who they really really are and not be afraid if they are a little different

1248910 the crazy thing i guess with an unexpected match is it can either go good or it could go bad
1248911 with chelsie we really really found our groove as far as how to work with each other i think finding that even though you have your ups and downs and everything chelsie and i really developed this brother sister type relationship we really supported each other and grew close to each other
1248912 i think its neat to end with the person you started with it was very sentimental
1248913 probably my worst dance on the show was the country two step i cant explain to you how hard that was

1248916 as far as our chemistry we didnt have to work on that
1248917 i feel like it just came naturally it was totally smooth sailing with her

1248972 i tell you this man went to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but he who humbles himself will be exalted
1248973 the outlookers arrested him less than an hour after his boat docked in cavasar the westernmost port of sileria it was a poor welcome home after nine years in exile but tansen supposed he should have counted on it despite his moorlander clothes and his kintish swords he still bore the unmistakable signs of a shallah and bore them proudly the long mane of dark hair the cross cut scars on his palms and a jashar the intricately woven and knotted belt which declared his name and victory
1248974 our objectives are serious and must therefore be accomplished in a thoroughly enjoyable manner in keeping with this we encourage singing music and general merrymaking at our public demonstrations serious business does not preclude a sense of humor

1248993 tell me dryads why this irenicus would go to such great lengths to keep you here
1248994 we are supposed to instill emotion but he is barren inside i am not sure what he expects

1249002 10 books that screwed up he world and 5 others that didnt help
1249003 the descent of man and selection in relation to sex
1249004 reading charles darwins the descent of man forces one to face an unpleasant truth that if everything he said in his more famous origin of species is true then it quite logically follows that human beings ought to ensure that the fit breed with abandon and that the unfit are weeded out
1249005 attempts to disengage darwin from the eugenics movement date from a bit after world war ii when hitler gave a bad name to survival of the fittest as applied to human beings but it is impossible to distance darwin from eugenics its a straight logical shot from his evolutionary arguments
1249006 darwin believed that morality was neither natural nor god given but was itself the result of natural selection whatever actions attitudes or passions happened to contribute to the survival of an individual or group were naturally selected the virtue of courage for example was naturally selected because in the struggle for existence the cowardly are wiped out right quickly and the manly types live on to breed happily with the appreciative maidens
1249007 those communities which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish best and rear the greatest number of offspring
1249008 it darwins view of sympathy substitutes indiscriminate niceness for goodness in human affairs
1249009 in trying to treat every living thing as part of one moral whole it ends up inverting the entire moral order and the natural order along with it the outcome is the animal rights activist who overflowing with sympathy for the chimpanzee destroys medical research clinics
1249010 that if humans being have rights animals have rights as well
1249011 the assumption that human beings are just one more animal on the evolutionary spectrum if we are just one more animal and so called moral traits are ultimately no more moral than any other evolved traits then we obviously are not morally distinct from any other animal
1249012 the inseparability of law and morality the constitution natural law and the rule of law
1249013 could include antidrug technologies and equipment special vehicles and aircraft communications security training pilot training geographic information systems rounds up the commentaries
1249014 beer pong is a virtual rendition of the popular college drinking game that requires players to toss ping pong balls across a table and into a cup of beer if your cup is hit you drink
1249015 we never anticipated such a severe reaction to the word
1249016 the controversy isnt entirely surprising the point of beer pong is to get your friends drunk and parents and university administrators generally frown on that sort of thing last fall georgetown university banned beer pong specially made beer pong tables and inordinate numbers of ping pong balls and any other alcohol related paraphernalia in its on campus dorms even in the rooms of students of legal drinking age the university of pennsylvania yale university the university of massachusetts at amherst and tufts university have also banned drinking games were pleased that tufts has put this in writing says michelle bowdler a health administrator at the school although we understand that twenty one is the legal drinking age we dont want our students participating in activities that could do excessive harm to themselves or others
1249017 do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own
1249018 i feel so fat and ugly in my own skin

1249026 kylie knows that she has thousands of fans in the uae and as it will be her d but in the country she has a lot to live up to
1249027 she is already planning the shows the costumes and the songs but there is no doubt that it will be the climax to the end of her year of touring kylie will be sure to give the shows a little local flavour she is just the person to bring maximum publicity to such a prestigious high profile development
1249028 he even got out his video camera to record the show it was clear that whatever relationship they have its stronger now than ever before
1249029 because kylie and alex are such good friends she spoke to him loads about the tour during the planning stages
1249030 it was only right she invited him over to see the finished product
1249031 i have never been unfaithful to a partner and would find it completely immoral to be involved with a married man
1249032 the court has scheduled this trial to begin on september 24 2008 with the government representing that it estimates that it will need three weeks to make its case the defense estimates that it will need one week the jury could be expected to get this case on or about october 22 a mere two weeks before the general election senator stevens must be able to campaign albeit limitedly during the trial were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
1249033 serious questions have arisen about the accuracy and reliability of new electronic voting machines
1249034 its imperative that congress does everything it can to help ensure that votes cast are recorded accurately
1249035 stemming from poor design inferior software engineering processes mediocre protective measures and insufficient comprehensive testing
1249036 e voting systems enable voters to inspect a physical e g paper record to verify the accuracy of their vote and to serve as an independent check on the record produced and stored by the system
1249037 in the state of utah we feel very good about what we have got and it does not qualify under this bill it would have to be thrown out after a lot of research a lot of work and a lot of money to put it in place and our experience with it in an election and it worked then we would say okay you have to throw it out i know i would get significant resistance because they would say demonstrate that what we have got is not working before you insist that we have to throw it away
1249038 provide for the independent verification of each ballot cast by means of a paper electronic audio video pictorial or other independently produced record
1249039 verifying by electronic records having one piece of software attest that another piece of software is honest is not verifying at all

1249080 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1249082 dishonest and dishonorable why do you think its okay to wear a bandage like that
1249083 do you really believe he didnt earn his medals or his purple hearts
1249084 did you squirm a little when you saw the guy wearing the purple heart
1249085 either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1249086 biggest challenger may not be republican john mccain but rather his own hubris

1249092 all men profess honesty as long as they can to believe all men honest would be folly to believe none so is something worse
1249093 courage and perseverance have a magical talisman before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air
1249094 men in general are quick to believe that which they wish to be true a government for the people must depend for its success on the intelligence the morality the justice and the interest of the people themselves
1249095 public officers are the servants and agents of the people to execute the laws which the people have made
1249096 never pick a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel
1249097 i sometimes wish that people would put a little more emphasis upon the observance of the law than they do upon its enforcement
1249098 the world is a dangerous place not because of those who do evil but because of those who look on and do nothing
1249099 dont join the book burners do not think you are going to conceal thoughts by concealing evidence that they ever existed
1249100 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1249101 the truth will set you free but first it will make you miserable
1249102 an error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation nor does truth become error because nobody sees it
1249103 there is nothing more corrupting nothing more destructive of the noblest and finest feelings of our nature than the exercise of unlimited power
1249104 the unrestricted competition so commonly advocated does not leave us the survival of the fittest the unscrupulous succeed best in accumulating wealth
1249105 honor is not the exclusive property of any political party
1249106 any man worth his salt will stick up for what he believes right but it takes a slightly better man to acknowledge instantly and without reservation that he is in error
1249107 i weep for the liberty of my country when i see at this early day of its successful experiment that corruption has been imputed to many members of the house of representatives and the rights of the people have been bartered for promises of office
1249108 it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their own selfish purposes
1249109 the duty of government is to leave commerce to its own capital and credit as well as all other branches of business protecting all in their legal pursuits granting exclusive privileges to none
1249110 the great constitutional corrective in the hands of the people against usurpation of power or corruption by their agents is the right of suffrage and this when used with calmness and deliberation will prove strong enough
1249111 timid men prefer the calm of despotism to the tempestuous sea of liberty
1249112 when angry count to ten before you speak if very angry count to one hundred
1249113 do you want to know who you are dont ask act action will delineate and define you
1249114 merchants have no country the mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains
1249115 outside of the constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizens and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us this broad principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects
1249116 change is the law of life and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future
1249117 efforts and courage are not enough without purpose and direction
1249118 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1249119 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
1249120 to stand in silence when they should be protesting makes cowards out of men
1249121 stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong
1249122 few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense the thought that the state has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable and so the evidence has to be internally denied
1249123 the great mass of people will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one
1249124 the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1249125 it becomes more necessary to see the truth as it is if you realize that the only vehicle for change are these people who have lost their personality
1249126 change means movement movement means friction only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict
1249127 we must believe that it is the darkest before the dawn of a beautiful new world we will see it when we believe it
1249128 cautious careful people always casting about to preserve their reputations can never effect a reform
1249129 no man or woman who tries to pursue an ideal in his or her own way is without enemies
1249130 the last struggle for our rights the battle for our civilization is entirely with ourselves
1249131 we draw our strength from the very despair in which we have been forced to live we shall endure
1249132 you are never strong enough that you dont need help
1249133 censorship is never over for those who have experienced it it is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it forever
1249134 do something if it doesnt work do something else no idea is too crazy
1249135 if you do not speak up when it matters when would it matter that you speak the opposite of courage is conformity even a dead fish can go with the flow
1249136 so now is the time more than ever for those who truly value all the principles of democracy especially including dissent to be the most forceful in speaking up standing up and speaking out
1249137 treat all men alike give them the same law give them an even chance to live and grow
1249138 expedience not justice is the rule of contemporary american law
1249139 i believe that no man who holds a leaders position should ever accept favors from either side he is then committed to show favors a leader must stand alone
1249140 pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living
1249141 he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it he who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it
1249142 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
1249143 the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict
1249144 its the little things citizens do thats what will make the difference my little thing is planting trees
1249145 all i was doing was trying to get home from work
1249146 truth often suffers more by the heat of its defenders than the arguments of its opposers
1249147 justice is never given it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final fact but a continuing evolving process to higher and higher levels of human social economic political and religious relationship
1249148 live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart
1249149 i always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because i think well if they attack one personally it means they have not a single political argument left
1249150 its just a ride and we can change it any time we want its only a choice no effort no work no job no savings and money a choice right now between fear and love

1249152 im widowed my six children are all grown they gave me a computer on my 80th birthday and told me mom its time to go back to school
1249153 my husband and i were married 57 years when he died it was like part of me was gone what saved my life was the computer
1249154 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon
1249155 at first a lot of our seniors worry that theyll break the computers
1249156 i started with the beginner class and then i took internet and e mail i must admit my mind is getting slower it takes me longer to digest the information now
1249157 but my kids are proud of me i send them e mails all the time and they e mail me and now i make my own cards nothing stops me now
1249158 i used to watch laguna beach and compare my life to it
1249159 i was part of the generation that watched sixteen candles and the breakfast club
1249160 i realized these were timeless stories but i felt that real life played out differently than they did on the big screen
1249161 you didnt always have the happy ending life was more complicated
1249162 i used to watch laguna beach and compare my life to it
1249163 i didnt want my life to be reduced to stereotypes
1249164 in the beginning you think im just the mean girl but by the end people can sympathize with me a bit this film dispels those kinds of myths
1249165 tv and film use stereotypes because theyre easier to package and sell but you have to wonder which came first the stereotype or the reality
1249166 theyve been around for a while i think the media is just reflecting the culture
1249167 theres a much broader reach now when teens are deciding how to represent themselves
1249168 those labels dont just exist among your friends its not just at school anymore
1249169 stereotypes do exist for a reason its the first impression that defines you until you get to know somebody
1249170 i guess its important to understand what they are because in some way they are true but you shouldnt judge people by them
1249171 its more realistic theyre willing to show the sex and the drugs
1249172 superbad was pretty accurate its about two non popular kids who dont fit in and dont really fit any stereotypes either
1249173 i read a lot and people tell me im nerdy but i dont really see myself that way
1249174 high school kids are annoyed by the labels the whole clique system but of course those labels exist whether they like them or not
1249175 as you get to know these kids you find out they have other interests than those stereotypes would suggest
1249176 well ralph school started yesterday i thought a little acknowledgement of the teachers might be appropriate
1249177 i dont think its appropriate at all if you dont mind me saying so parson
1249178 because this church paid good money for this sign and the purpose of it was to proclaim the gospel of jesus christ you hardly ever put anything up there about jesus and the marvelous love of god youre wasting our money
1249179 youre going to leave that dumb appreciate teachers stuff up there and not change it to a message about jesus
1249180 i dont approve of that being on a church sign parson

1249201 because most people can walk and run and climb and since i cant im defined as disabled not only defined as disabled im expected to act and feel disabled for many years i did the same but what they dont see now is that im a survivor

1249212 the water doesnt know the age you are when you jump in
1249213 i dont know why you have to buy all that junk for when i was your age i just used a rag and a bar o soap
1249214 this brilliant record has been sitting here unheard for 40 years and i get to play it for 300 people tonight
1249215 its a tough thing to define nothing that we play was actually created as northern soul its sort of an after the fact thing its whatever gets picked up on the scene and is played and people like and wanna dance to it changes its been going on for 35 years or so it started out as small label stuff from detroit and chicago and it was big label stuff too r amp b modern stuff through the 70s and 80s its all northern soul
1249216 there is a specific reason why its called northern soul during the 70s in the u k when the mod scene sort of tapered off from the 60s in london those kids started listening to psych music and stuff like that people in the north of england kept looking to the same 60s soul stuff eventually there was a magazine called blues amp soul one of the writers deemed the type of stuff they were dancing to in the north of england northern soul but it was always american music
1249217 thats part of the charm this brilliant record has been sitting here unheard for 40 years and i get to play it for 300 people tonight
1249218 its never gonna be on the radio never ever gonna be anywhere else but here
1249219 whats great about the music we play is that it has a melody it has lyrics that mean something its very emotional its not just a beat you can really connect with it in a way that you cant with a lot of contemporary music
1249220 there are people that hang out but people are there to dance
1249221 you dont wanna try to park at 11 p m on a saturday night on capitol hill too many hipsters too much pretense
1249222 i know a lot of the crowd wouldnt go up there here you can be outside and theres no complaints about people talking or smoking thats the beauty of lo fi we dont have any neighbors
1249223 its the place people will let the pretense down people want real music they hear this soul stuff and they wanna dance
1249224 this is just good energy good vibes you dont even have to have anyone to dance with you can just go for it and meet someone on the dance floor

1249227 its not definite and i think we should find some way to hold them down to some conditions
1249228 they know its a good thing they have been very cooperative and i believe are actively trying to figure out a way to make this work
1249229 we already have the tower the source of power and the land so it makes all the logic in the world
1249230 here is the opportunity and if its not realized there should be a significant disappointment for people in law enforcement and health care
1249231 this is going to be the biggest experiment on migrant safety since the migrant safety initiative in 1998
1249232 i think other governments would insist on it up and down the border if it works
1249233 i believe if its feasible on one it should be feasible on them all
1249234 look what i was able to do and im just a knucklehead
1249235 the teachers know all the kids your kid is not just going to blend into the background here
1249236 ive wondered if the parents had not been as involved as they were and as passionate and as strategic as they were about fighting for the school if we would have closed
1249237 what i liked about this school at the beginning was that i felt that if something was wrong everyone would stand up with me
1249238 and thats what happened the parents have really held the school together
1249239 flower wouldnt let me call flower had the phone that night and flower wouldnt call
1249240 if i can get paid to do that then im in
1249241 the goal is to take those ib strategies and infuse them into all of our schools

1249245 the child likely died from a stroke caused by a blood clot
1249246 in discussing them with other district attorneys we know these are not easy cases to prove
1249247 but that doesnt mean that they cant be proven or that we shouldnt try when all the facts appear to give a logical connection between physical force and subsequent death in a child
1249248 the defense can place that 1 percent of them on the witness stand and say sbs cannot occur
1249249 but its not practical for us to put the 99 percent who do believe on the stand
1249250 so in a trial if they trot five people to the stand and we counter with five people it looks like a 50 50 split in the medical community to a jury even if i put seven or 10 on the stand for our side it still looks like a greater split than it really is nationwide
1249251 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1249252 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
1249253 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
1249254 location information collected by cell phone companies can provide an extraordinarily invasive glimpse into the private lives of cell phone users courts have the right under statute and the duty under the fourth amendment to demand that the government obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before seizing such sensitive information
1249255 this is only the latest of many cases where eff has been invited to brief judges considering secret surveillance requests that arent supported by probable cause we hope this court recognizes the serious fourth amendment questions that are raised by warrantless access to cell phone location information and affirms the magistrates denial of the governments surveillance request
1249256 over the years epson has established enduring relationships with world renowned photographers

1249261 if we had not accepted public funding we would have had on hand enormous resources and when those swift boat attacks came we would have dealt with them in the medium in which they came which was paid advertising
1249262 its a testament that this guy can make tough choices

1249267 raising that issue is critical to having a dialogue into how we responsibly and safely withdraw our troops
1249268 moveon is member driven small donor driven over the past ten years 90 of our fund raising has been from small owners the current average donation is 42 21
1249269 swift boat veterans for truth was all big donor funded it was a couple of big donors calling the shots thats the antithesis of how moveon works and believes that civil society should work
1249270 if youre talking about a tight election and enough people are convinced of that in ohio it can make ohio slip into the republican column
1249271 were going to find just how deep race cuts in this country
1249272 well we call them the oh s t handles and i can happily say that we dont have a toy that we cant leave home without we just found out we are expecting so that is soon to come thanks for the contest

1249276 motorolas home and networks mobility and enterprise mobility solutions segments delivered strong results in the second quarter driven by sales growth and operating margin expansion these segments are well positioned to continue generating year over year sales and margin growth during the second half we also made progress on our plans to separate motorola into two independent publicly traded companies generated positive operating cash flow and reduced our cost structure
1249277 historically speaking were definitely seeing some of the strongest usage weve seen
1249278 as far as adequate supplies for todays heat we should be just fine

1249284 growth indicators including sales profits employment and investment all fell over during the last quarter which paints a very scary picture for australias 2 4 million small businesses
1249285 business expects the economy to grow by less this year under labors treasurer wayne swan than it did in the previous year under the coalition
1249286 it is a stinging truth that business has lost all faith in labor after only nine months in government
1249287 the australian economy has weathered many storms under the coalition including the asian financial crisis but it is evident small business doesnt think mr swan is capable of managing australias 1 1 trillion economy
1249288 labor is doing nothing to give business owners reassurance each time confidence hits a low labor succeeds in getting it even lower
1249289 at a time when australias gdp is relatively strong were seeing business confidence spiralling downwards under wall to wall labor governments
1249290 this is an abysmal position for australian business to be in
1249291 workably competitive although restricted by factors such as limited incentives for price competition between the major players coles and woolworths
1249292 consider the best way to introduce a mandatory national unit pricing scheme as recommended by the commission
1249293 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined the report said
1249294 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1249295 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1249296 vigorous price competitor since its arrival in the market in 2001
1249297 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1249298 significant buying power due to the fact that suppliers had very little option but to deal with them
1249299 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices the report said
1249300 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down mr bowen told reporters in melbourne
1249301 our global distribution diversified earning streams and strong capital position continue to help us support customers in todays challenging market conditions mr davis said
1249302 as the outlook for 2008 remains uncertain we remain alert to the risks but we also see opportunity ahead
1249303 a fundamental competitive advantage and where we expect sustainable long term growth
1249304 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1249305 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1249306 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1249307 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1249308 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1249309 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1249310 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1249311 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth
1249312 they did talk about inflation remaining high in the short term but on balance economic growth remains subdued
1249313 they talk about tight financial conditions further signs of a slowdown in domestic demand
1249314 it is a pretty clear sign that the next move is down
1249315 this statement is not as concerned about inflation they still expect inflation to be high in the short time
1249316 it is trying to judge how fast the economy is slowing
1249317 maybe it will take another one or two months to absolutely convince the board to get them across the line for a cut
1249318 we have been saying the end of this year or early next year
1249319 but we are sort of thinking it could be sooner rather later
1249320 our business model is based on the fact that users are willing to pay to license the software we develop and distribute
1249321 before adding that some companies are trading in such software and services that accompany them
1249322 a model competitor vertical in which one company controlling both the software and material of a product won success in a series of public goods such as personal computers mobile phones or of digital music players
1249323 we also offer such products vertical around software and hardware but our efforts in this regard are likely to increase our costs and reduce our margins
1249324 the hardest part is not to have been somebody but to remain
1249325 you can initiate remote wipe for specific devices and also cleanup device partnerships
1249326 okay everybody in the car were going to the library okay go ahead honey take a crap right there ill cover you go

1249330 we still dont even know what suit hell be wearing

1249334 the bars and the floor are my two strongest events so im going to concentrate on them
1249335 my main aim is to help the team qualify for the team final
1249336 obviously the doctors and physios are keeping a close eye on me and my personal coach is just making sure everything is staying in place
1249337 i havent changed my training preparation since ive come here ive just kept with what i was doing at home im happy with how its progressing and hopefully ill be fully fit
1249338 a medal of any colour would be the icing on the cake for me
1249339 thats my ultimate goal but if i dont achieve that i wont look back and regret it over my whole career
1249340 anything is possible all the teams are so close its all about what we can do on the day weve got good depth and strength in our team
1249341 id love to go to a home games i did the commonwealths in manchester but i think my body is going to be too old for 2012
1249342 its not rainers fault he played very well at wimbledon
1249343 he did play the semis even if it was after the olympic deadline
1249344 i guess the olympic committee thought he had better chances than me ive not spoken to rainer but there is no point to complain
1249345 ive been training for two weeks the hard court season is very important for me i cannot call the atp or itf every two days asking about the situation
1249346 i will be happy to play davis cup for germany
1249347 its not the fault of the german tennis federation but the olympic committee
1249348 and they are just sitting in their offices and making the decisions

1249355 once again nancy pelosi has made the democrats look like idiots
1249356 press briefing excerpt by ari fleischer 02 18 03 q thank you change to miguel estrada is the miguel estrada nomination now dead what can the president do to bring the nomination to the senate floor for a vote and does he plan to withdraw the nomination mr fleischer no the nomination is alive and kicking and it remains to be seen whether or not the obstructionist democratic tactics which are exceedingly rare and never before been successful will be continued i think this is a decision that some democrats have to make some democrats view the lesson of the last election is to go out and to run as far to the left as possible the reemergence of the liberal wing of the democrat party is in full swing which is making many of the moderates in the democratic party increasingly uncomfortable and so we will see whether or not the democrats continue with the obstructionist tactics and the president remains fully 100 percent dedicated to the confirmation of miguel estrada
1249357 his brimstone bellicosity about the war in iraq is unmatched by any of his fellow candidates and unwarranted by reality mccains use of words like victory and surrender indicates a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the complexities of the mesopotamian quagmire
1249358 no this is the funny free range mccain reincarnated the independent
1249359 obey wryly noted that he approached pelosi with the iraq war surtax and the iraq war supplemental at the same time
1249360 i told her nancy ive got two things here one youll like and the other you wont
1249361 the cavernous world serpent a submerged ship long forgotten beneath the waters more than mere machine the world serpent is alive filled with activity and even chaos here in the belly of the beast robots are preparing for war
1249362 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1249363 it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1249364 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1249365 surveys suggest a softening in business activity and there have also been some early signs of an easing in labour market conditions
1249366 its pretty clear that they have adopted an easing bias the financial and monetary conditions are too tight for their liking and that has clearly put downward pressure on activity
1249367 the question now is when they move and by how much that depends on forthcoming data and if the unemployment rate this thursday ticks up towards 4 5 per cent then we can expect them to move sooner rather than later
1249368 its all about when the rba is going to cut rates not if theyve made that clear and theyve clearly changed the emphasis away from inflation
1249369 even though they say inflation is still going to be high and the terms of trade is still a big driver of growth it is much more about growth now

1249379 i know the truth of my life and of my marriage my relationship and partnership my deep abiding friendship with my husband
1249380 its been enormously supportive to me through most of my life
1249381 now obviously weve had challenges as everybody in the world knows
1249382 but i never doubted that it was a marriage worth investing in even in the midst of those challenges and im really happy that i made that decision
1249383 not a decision for everybody and i think its so important for women to stand up for the right of women to make a decision that is best for them
1249384 the very first time i ever saw him we were at yale law school
1249385 and i turned to this friend of mine and said who is that and she said thats bill clinton and hes from arkansas and thats all he ever talks about
1249386 fast forward a couple of weeks i would see him in the hallway and i would look at him but i never met him
1249387 i was studying in the library one night and i was bored
1249388 so i put my books down and walked up to him and said if youre going to keep looking at me and im going to keep looking back at you we should at least know our names im hillary rodham whats your name and he always says i couldnt remember my name hes very funny about it
1249389 and from that moment on we started dating and we stayed together
1249390 oh hes so romantic hes always bringing me back things from his trips he brought me a giant wooden giraffe from africa
1249391 i had dental surgery and he said it reminded him of teeth
1249392 we have influenced each other so much over these goodness 36 years now
1249393 theres a bit of a challenge to say heres where he stops and i start and vice versa

1249397 now obviously weve had challenges as everybody in the world knows

1249410 real soldiers dont broadcast their service in big red lights
1249411 it appears that the gop is pinning all their hopes on capturing lightning in a bottle again with a redo of the insanity of the clinton years when firing people in the travel office was the greatest threat to democracy
1249412 its the sort of thing senators regularly do for their constituents but shes going to pay for it now
1249413 he is despised by the activists in the republican party
1249414 we refuse to be std tested until we can work free from harassment
1249415 now our husbands will behave better and the prostitutes will leave
1249416 we are hated by a society that uses us regularly and ignored by institutions obligated to protect us
1249417 not endorsing the sentiments but you just have admire the sheer brilliance of an ad that has hillary clinton supporting 1 million of pork barrel funding to commemorate woodstock and thereby planting her firmly on one side of the cultural revolution while john mccain was

1249425 the policies of iran constitute perhaps the single greatest challenge for american security interests in the middle east and possibly around the world because the combination of iranian terrorism iranian repression at home and the pursuit of nuclear weapons technology technologies that could lead to a nuclear weapon is a very dangerous mix

1249443 based on the existing body of evidence and our experience implementing male circumcision to strengthen our prevention efforts we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowest in the nations of eastern and southern africa
1249444 as news gets out about the efficacy of male circumcision we need to meet that demand with quality services and a comprehensive hiv prevention approach and scale up male circumcision as an ethical human rights issue
1249445 we seem to forget that we have an intervention that is 60 to 70 percent effective for preventing hiv in men more effective than any vaccine currently under development but the word is getting out just by word of mouth the demand is so great that already men are going to unqualified practitioners and experiencing serious complications we must scale up our response rapidly to meet the demand for safe circumcision services
1249446 we were struck by this monumental research that shows circumcision having the greatest efficacy in curbing the spread of heterosexual transmission of hiv to date greater than any vaccine in the pipeline today
1249447 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1249448 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1249449 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor

1249454 i mean on that theory i m getting tortured running for president of the united states that s plain silly that s silly
1249455 which tens of thousands of american cheerleaders are subjected to each fall
1249456 utter nonsense i thought that by now every intelligent person knew that h a l is derived from heuristic algorithmic
1249457 i know the truth of my life and of my marriage my relationship and partnership my deep abiding friendship with my husband
1249458 its been enormously supportive to me through most of my life
1249459 now obviously weve had challenges as everybody in the world knows
1249460 but i never doubted that it was a marriage worth investing in even in the midst of those challenges and im really happy that i made that decision
1249461 not a decision for everybody and i think its so important for women to stand up for the right of women to make a decision that is best for them
1249462 the very first time i ever saw him we were at yale law school
1249463 and i turned to this friend of mine and said who is that and she said thats bill clinton and hes from arkansas and thats all he ever talks about
1249464 fast forward a couple of weeks i would see him in the hallway and i would look at him but i never met him
1249465 i was studying in the library one night and i was bored
1249466 so i put my books down and walked up to him and said if youre going to keep looking at me and im going to keep looking back at you we should at least know our names im hillary rodham whats your name and he always says i couldnt remember my name hes very funny about it
1249467 and from that moment on we started dating and we stayed together
1249468 oh hes so romantic hes always bringing me back things from his trips he brought me a giant wooden giraffe from africa
1249469 i had dental surgery and he said it reminded him of teeth
1249470 we have influenced each other so much over these goodness 36 years now
1249471 theres a bit of a challenge to say heres where he stops and i start and vice versa
1249472 i know the truth of my life and of my marriage my relationship and partnership my deep abiding friendship with my husband
1249473 its been enormously supportive to me through most of my life

1249488 what if your child were kidnapped and had a timebomb set to go off in an hour
1249489 we ve decided to make swampland a register to comment site starting a few days from now
1249490 would i object if an enemy treated our soldiers this way
1249491 just as a sun shower and a deluge are both
1249492 but it will also likely bring out the worst in a republican party that has begun to see immigration as the new right wing wedge issue of the twenty first century

1249495 in an incredibly savage time she showed remarkable religious tolerance
1249496 in that particular period it was one of the most stable empires of that time
1249497 its long been my belief that the gop hole card in 2008 is going to be a rancid furriner bashing anti illegal immigrant smear campaign
1249498 by so doing hes also a supporter of all it entails and implies massive government corruption
1249499 i would like to see a way to make what those immigrants who are just here to work to become legal
1249500 can we stick all of the illegal immigrants convicted of crimes in joe kleins closet and send klein the bill for the
1249501 you dont have money to fund the war or the children but you are going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to iraq to get their heads blown off for the presidents amusement
1249502 joe just got finished sending a formal letter of complaint to your bosses demanding that you are terminated for you public support of illegal immigration
1249503 it wont fix unemployment sadly but thats a problem america has to try and cope with deporting 11 million people who have lived here for years in many cases is inhumane and completely impossible
1249504 im all for amnesty provided the immigrant has a full time job and his her employer is willing to pay double back taxes and also pay any difference between minimum wage and what the person was earning the immigrant would then be eligible for a guest worker visa and if he remains employed for 5 years would be eligible to apply for citizenship
1249505 the immigration problem could easily be solved if existing laws concerning employment documentation were actually followed and enforced
1249506 scottoest what i mean is that we should demand that anyone making over say 150 000 pays much higher income taxes along with of course getting rid of the bush tax cuts and other deductions like interest on mortgage payments the rich in this nation have an obligation to help up the rest of us
1249507 i am wildly in favor of immigration legal and illegal
1249508 im deeply grateful to the immigrants many of them illegal who saved the city by bringing commerce and sales tax revenues to some of the toughest neighborhoods in the 1970s and 1980s
1249509 98 9 of all latinos who cross our southern border looking for work are just fabulous hardworking people
1249510 i tend to be an extremist on this issue i am wildly in favor of immigration legal and illegal i realize that national security i e terrorism requires that we secure the borders and thats a good thing if almost impossible but as a new yorker im deeply grateful to the immigrants many of them illegal who saved the city by bringing commerce and sales tax revenues to some of the toughest neighborhoods in the 1970s and 1980s
1249511 the protestants began to get worried about the irish catholic surge in the 1840s
1249512 joe 30 of all inmates in our prisons are illegals you idiot
1249513 at the same time americas criminal justice system is bulging with these citizens of other countries according to the federal bureau of prisons 30 percent of federal prisoners are not u s citizens at a cost of 63 a day taxpayers spend more than 3 million every day to house non u s citizen dollars in our federal prisons most are thought to be illegal aliens
1249514 pro immigrant low immigration think tank which seeks fewer immigrants but a warmer welcome for those admitted
1249515 there are legitimate concerns about immigration including environmental worries about expansion of cities etc
1249516 maybe you snuck into the country as well breaking our laws illegally purchased the ss and identity of someone else and ever since have been living comfortably on the government dole why so sensitive grow up you ugly whiny treehugging crybaby
1249517 joe just got finished sending a formal letter of complaint to your bosses demanding that you are terminated for you public support of illegal immigration
1249518 ask any irs clerk try imf adjustments at your local district office what they think of illegals and their bogus tax paperwork hope and pray they never file with your tax id number scooter then ask them how that reconciles with social security medicaid s chip education funding and the census then ask yourself how you ever voted democrap in the first place
1249519 would cost to fund government agencies to try and root out 12 million undocumented people in this country
1249520 scooter needs to have a chat with his local nteu steward before waxing wise on tax policy issues with which he has absolutely no basic knowledge and most particularly in light of his almost complete lack of common sense
1249521 then ask yourself how supporting a policy that continues to force them to file under false identities solves the problem
1249522 illegal aliens wont file under false identities if they arent here in the first place thats the goal reduce those here now prevent more from coming giveaways of any kind lead to the opposite effect so we enforce the law now and we keep doing that then fewer illegal aliens are here and that means fewer will file under false identities
1249523 national sales tax and chuck the income tax works for me
1249524 fair enough but that is a separate issue from this
1249525 and you thought all those illegal vote for hillary aliens were harmless
1249526 it is not fair to those people either there is no easy answer however we cannot continue at this rate to just stand idly by and pretend the issue doesnt exhist
1249527 amnesty didnt change the course of this problem in 86 when regan let 2 million illegal aliens get a free pass into this country
1249528 as i said before deport the illegals who are criminals encourage the others to become proper contributing members to our society
1249529 klein and to a lesser extent you scooter automatically assumes the illegals issue is race based when of course that is simply lefty race baiting on your part
1249530 there are lots and lots of valid concerns when it comes to illegal immigration i would be ignorant if i said that anyone who doesnt agree with my point of view is just a racist
1249531 this is primarily an economic issue where our tax base is being skewed to the extreme detriment of those that follow the law
1249532 in response to part of the endless blather from scottoest above the way to ensure that our laws are enforced is actually quite simple to state we simply discredit those like joe klein who support illegal activity that includes those politicians who try to subvert our laws for instance john mccain admits that his support for illegal activity has hurt his chances we simply help others see that
1249533 thats true scott but youd be an idiot to think that the vast majority of the people so upset by illegal immigration arent racists
1249534 this sort of nativism has been a persistent loser in american political history
1249535 the proportion of americans who eat oatmeal for breakfast has not changed in 20 years

1249538 the current welfare system is about politics and bureaucracy and takes over peoples lives based on one size fits all
1249539 but the problems of poverty are very individual very nuanced there are times when people need very direct charity and other times when they need an infinite amount of patience the bureaucratic mentality is not suited to this
1249540 we need to reform the culture for people to take responsibility for their neighbours
1249541 the problem with welfare societies is that when you have people relinquishing moral responsibility you have moral decay as well there is no guarantee that if you have a prosperous economy you are going to have a morally responsible society but i think there is a greater chance than if you have the kind of weakening of the moral fabric that took place in the soviet union
1249542 tomorrow i will present my 37 thousand signature petition calling for mandatory country of origin labelling of all fresh and single component food to the health select committee

1249545 sure i was at double the legal limit but the erratic driving was caused by my use of mismatched snow tyres you really ought to ban them or some one could get hurt
1249546 snow tyres in themselves are not dangerous if fitted new as complete sets and obviously perform best in the application for which they are designed severe snow conditions
1249547 teenage sisters lucy and isabelle simon died in january 2007 when their car slid on a bridge near levin and hit a truck a coroner found texting and mixing worn snow tyres with standard tyres were the prime causes of the crash
1249548 it comes down to one thing money i think we should name and shame the people that are using the business then let their partners know
1249549 i will sit outside and do my knitting if i have to
1249550 ive always been a feminist and its demeaning to women we have benefits in new zealand you dont have to sell yourself to make money

1249557 it was a shocking and brutal murder one can only imagine the pain and suffering her family has gone through
1249558 after seven years investigators have still been receiving new information about this crime which gives everyone renewed hope that the answers are out there
1249559 the coroner has covered all aspects of the investigation and made appropriate recommendations which we will take on board
1249560 a democratic and social state has the duty to protect the poorest and the weakest which include the unborn the handicapped the elderly and the terminally ill when the state instead of protecting the weakest provides legal cover for the culture of death it automatically is transformed into a totalitarian state the foundations of coexistence are broken and a society of death a true thanatocracy a government run by death emerges
1249561 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1249562 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1249563 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1249564 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1249565 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1249566 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1249567 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change
1249568 they talk about uncertainty weighing on both inflation and growth
1249569 they did talk about inflation remaining high in the short term but on balance economic growth remains subdued
1249570 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1249571 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1249572 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1249573 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz
1249574 i am happy to have people protest outside my electoral office but it is not going to change the situation at all
1249575 social peace for a paltry half million dollars strikes me as the most courageous and forgivable kind of corruption

1249577 serving our country at times means sacrifice tony did just that at a time when he was at the pinnacle of his career at fox news he was asked to serve his country and he gave up the financial rewards his future held having served his country well tony left the white house to earn money to help secure his childrens future unfortunately fighting cancer did not give him much time to do that and so the purpose of this trust is to help achieve tonys goal of securing his childrens future including their college educations
1249578 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine
1249579 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god
1249580 the policy of the american government is to leave their citizens free neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits
1249581 you dont have money to fund the war or the children but you are going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to iraq to get their heads blown off for the presidents amusement
1249582 the answer is among others democratic senatorial campaign committee chairman chuck schumer who was putting on pretty much of a full court press
1249583 please join me in showing your support for rep stark and his continued courageous stand against the neocons dont let them silence his voice
1249584 maybe they can come up with someone more in tune with the democratic base now
1249585 well yes but that comes under the heading of silverplate linings i dont think raising money on his own would have been much of a problem if kerrey had run he was himself after all a former chairman of the dscc
1249586 it means that republicans will not have to spend nearly as much money in nebraska
1249587 like a swift migrating fish the word cellulite has suddenly crossed the atlantic

1249592 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1249593 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase
1249594 that was always mr rudds plan to slow the economy
1249595 and now the reserve bank is in a position in looking forward where it is so concerned about the state of the australian economy that its forecasting there may be room to reduce interest rates in the future
1249596 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1249597 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1249598 israels major sources of drinking water including the sea of galilee and the mountain aquifer are below their red lines meaning they are not recommended to draw water
1249599 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1249600 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1249601 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1249602 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1249603 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure
1249604 it is important that the community understands she is not blaming anyone else
1249605 si aggiunga poi che come e accaduto nel caso di specie in materia fiscale
1249606 in that situation he has to keep the ball in the zone and come to me
1249607 we have a job to do tonight and every night for the rest of the season but at the same time its my sixth season in baseball and ive never made the playoffs
1249608 its obviously in the back of my mind that i could play in october
1249609 i wish we could have won the game because it would have been something special for us but i think we showed what were made of
1249610 it was big especially since i didnt come through earlier in the game
1249611 we got nobody out in the bullpen just terrible pitches balls flying around everywhere
1249612 we have to have someone step up and make pitches not very much fun
1249613 the competitor in me wants to be perfect right away
1249614 but i know its going to take a little time i was a little more confident this time
1249615 were going to battle so hard for that second olympic gold its worth any sacrifice
1249616 there are thousands of examples to show that being favourite doesnt matter on the pitch
1249617 the team that wins is the one that deserves it and is best on the day not the one with the most tradition or a name theres only one way to win with the ball
1249618 i cant see why they are backing me i think people should start saving their money or put it on someone else theres six or seven other blokes who are well ahead
1249619 its pretty similar his form compared to last year but i have to play a number of different roles than i did last year
1249620 different positions which i have absolutely enjoyed and it has developed me as a footballer
1249621 we dont want to lose at all we love winning were pretty competitive people
1249622 its a tribute to wade and our medical staff that hes in a position to come back into the side now
1249623 hes done everything required of him and were pleased hes made it back for what is another really important game for us against one of the competitions best sides
1249624 its a huge game for us it always is when you play them and im really looking forward to being out there with the boys again
1249625 i really appreciate the work the medical guys have done and i cant wait to get back into it
1249626 its been difficult at times working my way back from the operation but everyone has been helping me
1249627 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1249628 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
1249629 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1249630 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumors
1249631 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1249632 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1249633 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumors the ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent
1249634 provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1249635 my head is still spinning i cant quite believe what has happened and how quickly it has happened
1249636 i just liked the whole afl package the speed of the game the varied skills and the competitiveness
1249637 id always played soccer and i guess my long term goal was to play for australia
1249638 i was thinking that if things went well maybe at 20 or 21 i might move to brisbane to see how far i could go
1249639 i wasnt really too interested in afl back then although i used to watch the brisbane lions on tv although that all changed when i started playing
1249640 this is what the government said we would do before the election
1249641 we said we would bring forward water purchasing and thats what were doing
1249642 so we are simply rolling out the water purchase program as we were elected to do and as we committed to do prior to the election
1249643 we actually purchased high security water as well as general security and low security water so we did purchase high security water in the murray
1249644 we assessed the offers put to us by sellers on the basis of value for money which included an assessment of how environmentally valuable they would be so well approach this new purchase in the same way
1249645 what we are doing is doing what we said we would do
1249646 my wifes due to have a baby in early october so its going to be a bit of a tough time for her and for us having a new baby
1249647 we also have an 18 month old boy so well wait and see what happens but its going to be pretty unlikely
1249648 i havent spoken to anyone at the australian rugby league
1249649 i just found out i was in the squad the other day and ill have to take the appropriate sort of action and speak to the right people
1249650 id love to play and i think if my wife wasnt pregnant id love to jump at the opportunity but its one of those things you want to be there for your family as well it can be a pretty tough time and an exciting time also so its something i dont want to miss out on
1249651 the way he carried the ball and smashed blokes he was awesome
1249652 i said to the boys after the game i thought simmos performance if you contrast other players where theyve come back after injury it was a credit to simmo just how dominant he was
1249653 when you come back from a couple of little injuries you always have a few butterflies there so its good to get out and play some minutes and get out of it pretty well
1249654 we know exactly where we are at at the moment and we have to change a few things
1249655 i think on the weekend we showed patches of good form
1249656 but to be a good side in this competition being so even you have to be able to consistently produce it week in week out quarter by quarter which the top sides like geelong have been able to do and we are not producing that at the moment
1249657 it was the second quarter when our concentration lapsed letting a flood of goals in cost us the game
1249658 the western bulldogs are still sitting in the top four and they are a good side
1249659 so to be able to do that for three quarters is good but not good enough in the afl competition weve got to consistently be able to do it
1249660 you get knocked around a bit with your confidence when you lose games of footy but we are just looking forward to the challenge getting a win on the board hopefully on the weekend and then move forward
1249661 we are not a side that is probably playing like they should be fourth at the moment but we are really looking forward to the challenge this week
1249662 it was great to be able to bring some kids in you get that enthusiasm and confidence
1249663 adam goodes will be close and leo barry will be up and around the mark we just have to pick the best possible team we can
1249664 but they definitely gave us a lift on the weekend the young players
1249665 patrick one goal and 17 possessions played with some confidence and flair and played on instinct and i think as a team thats something we need to get back to
1249666 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1249667 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous
1249668 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1249669 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1249670 do we have a cultural issue on that absolutely not
1249671 we have a playing group that lives every day disciplined and focussed on winning a premiership
1249672 i didnt really know clarko that well and i had played on him several times and to stop me running he used to punch on with me
1249673 clarko moved on a lot of my close mates who were a bit older i thought thats not a great way to start a relationship
1249674 i honestly dont think anyone could have done a better job than what hes done i have no doubt thats a main reason why were having success
1249675 hes an extraordinary athlete and my only way of trying to defeat him was to try to belt him but i couldnt catch him all that often
1249676 there were so many within the playing group that looked up to him and he needed to assure the rest of his team mates that the direction of the decision making that the team had undertaken was the right one for the club
1249677 all those people who arent lucky enough to be around the club now to see the way it is i just wish that they could see how great the club is inside and out
1249678 i feel like im representing all those past players that didnt have the chance to be a really successful side
1249679 it is a complicated issue it is something that is up to deidre and it is up to the liberal party to resolve and it is not something i should be involved in
1249680 i cant answer whether she will be given another seat
1249681 wise heads have to prevail it is an extraordinary situation that we find ourselves in
1249682 the important thing is we are going about winning government and all liberal members of parliament must be united in that
1249683 when the liberals meet tomorrow i hope there is open and frank discussion of forming an opposition
1249684 i have been an mp for 18 years i have received remarkable goodwill and friendship from my electorate
1249685 it is my electorate more than anyone that has been urging me take on this role
1249686 if i am elected leader of the liberal party tomorrow i will endeavour to answer all of your questions
1249687 you dont win an election by being against a war
1249688 as a full card carrying member of the beltway opinion making elite you are the last person i would trust to tell me why americans think anything at all
1249689 we must as a country return to federalism where issues like abortion guns assisted suicide marriage and flag burning are under the jurisdiction of the states not the federal government
1249690 the 2006 election is a referendum on the war bush sends 30 000 more troops
1249691 the democrats will get him in september bush beats em back with a stick and gets 6 more months
1249692 democrats will get face saver with the webb amendment to time at home for troops they cant even get that what happened to all those wavering republicans
1249693 democrats finally corner him with a cuddly kids bill like schip bush vetoes it and will drag them to the negotiating table
1249694 democrats will weaken surveillance bush pounds them into submission in august hell do it again on renewal
1249695 bush threatens spending vetoes the democrats disassemble and cant even get a bill passed
1249696 can you imagine if we actually got rid of all that spending
1249697 you dont have money to fund the war or the children but you are going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to iraq to get their heads blown off for the presidents amusement
1249698 unbelievably the democratic congress continues to be outsmarted by the bush white house yes the margins are narrow enough that they cant overturn the veto w o republican votes still its very disheartening
1249699 the 2006 election is a referendum on the war bush sends 30 000 more troops
1249700 the democrats will get him in september bush beats em back with a stick and gets 6 more months
1249701 democrats will get face saver with the webb amendment to time at home for troops they cant even get that what happened to all those wavering republicans
1249702 democrats finally corner him with a cuddly kids bill like schip bush vetoes it and will drag them to the negotiating table
1249703 democrats will weaken surveillance bush pounds them into submission in august hell do it again on renewal
1249704 bush threatens spending vetoes the democrats disassemble and cant even get a bill passed
1249705 i hope they are keeping records of people like you who are against her and then give them to her so she can get the irs to audit you
1249706 if i have a sexual encounter with a cow then suck my own seed out of the anus of said cow then tounge kiss my boy friend transfering the brow dirty goodness to him it is not feltcing
1249707 hey thats cool guys go ahead and spend that because bush isnt throwing my money down a hole fast enough with his secret prisons and shady inept contractors
1249708 democrats leadership knows the only way to end the war is to cut off funding with a 51 vote
1249709 show some respect to our future president hillary rodham clinton i hope they are keeping records of people like you who are against her and then give them to her so she can get the irs to audit you
1249710 this is such complete bs i cant believe you are serious
1249711 most of the people in this country boarder on hypochondriacs anyway
1249712 you could easily see that 110 spiral up to 350 billion a year forever in this country
1249713 as i stated before if it is free some will go everytime they get a headache of a sniffle
1249714 this is now a we society and you need to do your part for the common good
1249715 es un acuerdo importante pues la propiedad a ade un nuevo target y una nueva imagen al cat logo de imira presenta incontables oportunidades no s lo en escolar y editorial sino tambi n en textil complementos o perfumer a
1249716 look youre telling us all the same stuff marion told us when we met with her and youre saying all the right things
1249717 it all makes sense but it all made sense when marion said it too
1249718 in contrast to those who have bobbed and weaved and used every excuse not to be an open book you had a startling offer
1249719 but i asked for this and i want to prove that im clean so for me its worth it
1249720 its a really unfair environment for truly clean athletes to have to live in
1249721 so weve got to come up with a model that allows us to further support clean athletes and do what we can do to try to take away that presumption of guilt that unfortunately exists out there today
1249722 projected a model that would restore faith but when usada announced details of the program it scratched the name without an explanation
1249723 whether its dara or any other athlete in this program we cant guarantee their cleanliness
1249724 these guys act like theyre interested in cleaning it up
1249725 i said what do you mean the codes are gone
1249726 for some reason at the end of the games they wanted to get everybody out fast
1249727 apparently they took the safe from the princes room and they took it somewhere around los angeles where they had a big storage facility and they left it there how they got the codes shredded how they got into the safe i dont know
1249728 unfortunately we rely on an inadequate doping system and doping agencies for the proof
1249729 we live in a society where its innocent until proven guilty the key word being proven and we dont have any way of proving these people are cheating we never did
1249730 i think he ended up being pleased that someone was taking him seriously
1249731 most of the establishment was writing him off as some sort of crank or blowhard
1249732 he said he had a lot of documents that would be helpful but he wasnt sure if under the remaining three to four months of his parole hed be doing something that might violate any of those conditions
1249733 they asked me whether i thought it was worth pursuing and i said i thought it was
1249734 does that mean there will be no doping at the games probably not but it does mean that the limitations on somebody escaping detections are reduced markedly
1249735 dopers are taking smaller doses and quit well in time to the tested competition maintaining the benefits for awhile with blood transfusions
1249736 and thats a story that really ought to get flushed out because it makes you think oh my god how could they do that
1249737 this was a good country and nice people and here were all these kids one doping right under your nose not only that but they were measuring their hemoglobin five or six times a day with a little handheld machine they had all kinds of ways to do it if their hemoglobin got too high they took a bottle of saline and lowered it if it got too low they squirted in some red cells
1249738 its essentially a baby step or a necessary step to help evolve the science and to most benefiting clean athletes
1249739 when i see a four story multi hundred square foot building in beijing packed with chinese ready to do doping control good grief i never imagined we could get that far
1249740 i think the rest of the world probably now looks at the u
1249741 you look at the way the country has positioned itself and is positioned by the rest of the world i think the united states has been a leader in the world economy and so on and sport around the world looks to the united states
1249742 what i didnt know is how thoroughly organized and rotten these people were
1249743 not only did they have chemists but they had labs helping them they had doctors a whole consortium of people all of whom were trying to beat my test and find ways to dope athletes and they did
1249744 weve made so many steps forward we have things we never had before but how many new drugs are there out there that we dont know about
1249745 as a scientist i can do nothing but applaud because this is what they should be doing
1249746 they should have started it 15 years ago when i started talking about it
1249747 ok well they missed the boat but at least theyre doing it and ok maybe im not getting credit but i dont have to have credit im glad to see somebodys finally doing what i think ought to be done
1249748 so who knows that your tests go a lot further than theirs
1249749 people that know you that like you that are on your side for them nothing changes but for people who are evil and suspicious you can do whatever you want to you will not change their mind
1249750 but now today i would say i was wrong because she did change peoples minds
1249751 i have no idea about the background of these people
1249752 so when you tell me that theyre involved with drugs or whatever its totally news to me
1249753 now from what youre telling me they may have tried to get into working with some people like that starting small with protein shakes and later finding different ways or whatever but it never came to that
1249754 simply because i didnt like what they were doing and i thought it was useless since then i havent seen them at all
1249755 she doesnt even know these people so the connection between dara and what these guys are doing is totally absurd
1249756 i have the simplest of tastes i like only the best
1249757 significantly elevating color purity compared to traditional single white led backlights
1249758 das zu behaupten w re angesichts unserer daten viel zu spekulativ
1249759 schizophrenie kann man sicher nicht als kognitiven schimpansen zustand ansehen und auch was den reinen stoffwechsel betrifft m ssen wir nderungen immer im kontext des gesamten systems sehen also den hirnen von affen und menschen sie funktionieren einfach nicht auf dieselbe weise
1249760 i came across kevin as an eight or nine year old playing for clarendon a pietermaritzburg primary school he was obviously pretty talented but what also stuck out was how highly competitive he was he was always a very tough confident character
1249761 he brings a heck of a lot to any side because hes highly competitive very proud which is important at this level and highly respected as a player which is also important
1249762 kevin was not really considered as leadership material back then but he was never one to just talk he always walked the walk and told his team mates im going this way follow me
1249763 hes hardcore a get in your face type of guy he knows that if you punch someone theyll bleed and i believe thats one of the reasons he made such a difference to england in the 2005 ashes
1249764 to be honest he didnt show leadership potential when he was with natal but maybe thats because we were ahead of him as players and he was just starting out but i can probably see why england have gone for him as captain he was always incredibly hard working and disciplined in practice and hes willing to stand up and lead by example
1249765 leadership comes in many different forms and there are certain guys who never worry about criticism kevin has always batted positively and sometimes that involves risk but if kevin can carry on batting like he always has then he will inspire the whole england team to be positive and they will start backing themselves
1249766 hes always had an amazing work ethic right the way through from when he was a kid at kingsmead he used to observe the top players very closely analyse what they were doing and then practise using a similar method
1249767 hes pretty astute and tactically im sure hell be ok he spends a lot of time looking at the game and hes always thought about each bowler hes come up against and what game plan to employ against them he will lead from the front but theres definitely a smart analytical side to him as well
1249768 he does like pressure he loves centre stage hes just one of those freak sportsmen
1249769 how else would he have left south africa and then gone back and scored three hundreds in his first limited overs series
1249770 kevins driven by competitiveness and he is always looking to find ways of being better he will certainly bring that attitude into the england teams way of playing
1249771 likely etim was behind the attack which also injured 16 other police
1249772 experts as saying the nature of the attack suggested a terrorist group
1249773 there is little doubt that the etim is behind the attack
1249774 hes rehydrating hes eating a little and getting some oxygen
1249775 anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1249776 the armys pilots are still waiting for an improvement in the weather conditions and the moment they were allowed to fly they will pick up the italian mountaineer
1249777 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1249778 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1249779 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters 26 250 feet it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1249780 if you were being sensible you would put an immediate moratorium on all old growth logging all around the country because its clear the carbon stocks are so much higher than anyone has previously analysed before
1249781 the last thing you would do would be to log old growth forests in tasmania or victoria
1249782 we seem rather unfair to other sectors who are you know having a close scrutiny of emissions profiles from you know the energy sector and coal and transport and we really should be doing the same for all sectors
1249783 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice there isnt any privacy get over it
1249784 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
1249785 firstly often identification is a real issue in a case as the broadcasting of cctv or other pictures often interferes with the integrity of a court case
1249786 secondly its a huge invasion of privacy and its a procedure which we think should be kept under control clearly here the standard of policing has been unacceptably low if the police cant get their act together and they are making that kind of mistake the protection of the courts is needed
1249787 this is what the government said we would do before the election
1249788 we said we would bring forward water purchasing and thats what were doing
1249789 so we are simply rolling out the water purchase program as we were elected to do and as we committed to do prior to the election
1249790 we actually purchased high security water as well as general security and low security water so we did purchase high security water in the murray
1249791 we assessed the offers put to us by sellers on the basis of value for money which included an assessment of how environmentally valuable they would be so well approach this new purchase in the same way
1249792 we remain committed to running a profitable business and believe the recent reduction and reallocation of our workforce enables us to do this even in todays challenging environment we continue to take a conservative stance to our outlook specifically as it relates to north american and united kingdom financial services markets but believe that the investments we have been making in alliances and in geographic and vertical diversification will positively impact our results over the next several quarters
1249793 the new data center in north carolina is part of ibms commitment to construct the worlds most advanced data centers this is the latest example of ibms deep history of innovation in north carolina when we open for business in late 2009 the ibm data center in research triangle park will be a strategic location for our outsourcing business for years to come
1249794 despite continued uncertainty in the marketplace we exceeded our quarterly revenue guidance and our sequential growth once again outpaced our peer group in the second quarter several of our business segments including financial services performed well during the quarter furthermore we generated continued strong performance across europe and healthy growth from our business knowledge process outsourcing and it infrastructure services practices as a result of clients focusing on cost efficiencies
1249795 however it is important at this point that at least one point is cleared up
1249796 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1249797 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure
1249798 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1249799 workably competitive although restricted by factors such as limited incentives for price competition between the major players coles and woolworths
1249800 consider the best way to introduce a mandatory national unit pricing scheme as recommended by the commission
1249801 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined the report said
1249802 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1249803 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1249804 vigorous price competitor since its arrival in the market in 2001
1249805 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1249806 significant buying power due to the fact that suppliers had very little option but to deal with them
1249807 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices the report said
1249808 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down mr bowen told reporters in melbourne
1249809 disapproved president in history and tamarack is after the hard earned retirement money of worker bees and pension funds so the rich will have a playground and multi million dollar vacation homes
1249810 will either live or die based upon free market principles
1249811 an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea
1249812 the first half performance strengthens our confidence and reflects a demand that remained sustained we now have very good visibility over the third quarter
1249813 ive set it all up youre going to try out and write about our superman its my cousins parks crowning achievement
1249814 stand on the scale so we can determine which equipment we should use
1249815 tell me something how long has the superman been in operation
1249816 in september it will a full half of one year
1249817 sementara penelitian yang saya lakukan pada tahun 1999 lalu terhadap pasien yang datang ke klinik pasutri tercatat sekitar 18 persen remaja pernah melakukan hubungan seksual pranikah
1249818 pada pria biasanya menampakan gejala berbeda dengan wanita seringkali tidak menampakan gejala yang jelas paling paling hanya timbul keputihan atau anyang anyang
1249819 masalah seks dengan pasangannya justru dijadikan legistimasi untuk melakukan seks bebas bahkan saat ini seks bebas sudah menjadi bagian dari budaya bisnis
1249820 karena pada kenyataannya pengaruh gaya seks bebas yang mereka terima jauh lebih kuat dari pada control yang mereka terima maupun pembinaan secara keagamaan
1249821 sekuat kuatnya mental seorang remaja untuk tidak tergoda pola hidup seks bebas kalau terus menerus mengalami godaan dan dalam kondisi sangat bebas dari kontrol tentu suatu saat akan tergoda pula untuk melakukannya godaan semacam itu terasa lebih berat lagi bagi remaja yang memang benteng mental dan keagamaannya tidak begitu kuat
1249822 selain itu tentu membekali putra putrinya dengan benteng ajaran agama yang kokoh
1249823 karena biasanya orang tua yang hamil di luar nikah akan cenderung mencari jalan pintas untuk menutupi aib yang dideritannya padahal cara ini selain tidak berprikemanusiaan juga akan menyebabkan beban ganda pada anak anak yang gagal di aborsi
1249824 upaya yang dilakukan yayasan sayap ibu ini bukannya justru memberikan peluang kepada anak anak remaja untuk melakukan seks bebas tapi semata untuk menolong nyawa ribuan generasi muda dari perbuatan tidak berkemanusiaan aborsi illegal bukan hanya berbahaya bagi janin tapi juga nyawa ibu muda itu sendiri karena setiap janin berdasarkan kontroversi hak anak internasional perlu dijaga kelangsungan hidupnya
1249825 pendidikan kesehatan reproduksi di kalangan remaja bukan hanya memberikan pengetahuan tentang organ reproduksi tetapi bahaya akibat pergaulan bebas seperti penyakit menular seksual dan sebagainya dengan demikian anak anak remaja ini bisa terhindar dari percobaan melakukan seks bebas
1249826 the good news is that the shortfall vs consensus was more than explained by mark to market losses on the groups investment portfolio
1249827 this should be good for the stock because the market was anticipating a weak result and the stock is already pricing the risk of considerable further downside to earnings per share
1249828 frankly it is impossible to predict how and when this will play out or what the next round of bad news will be
1249829 in the meantime it will continue to be a difficult time for our industry
1249830 at axa whilst we can seek to mitigate its impact through effective risk management we are not immune
1249831 overall its very difficult to predict how this is all going to play out but it would be a mistake to assume its going to get easier quickly
