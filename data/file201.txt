2010000 not only to the nypd but to the ccrb civilian complaint review board
2010001 we think aggregation is an exciting and fast growing space
2010002 however aggregation without a personal touch curation only causes frustration and disappoint for users looking for useful and contextual video
2010003 this is a strategic opportunity for drs to expand our support for the united states air force in our core competencies of aircraft modification repair and overhaul
2010004 what about educational activities you know like enrichment activities and lessons
2010005 um he was signed up for t ball a couple of years ago he has therapy
2010006 oh yes he is at discovery camp this week and takes karate and an art tutor comes to work with our homeschool group and we are so busy we hardly have time to eat dinner we have to pack sandwiches in the cooler
2010007 its not like he really is going to rape a girl and if he does well that his business not yours
2010008 so why isnt it conspicuous for the droves of men who vociferously support the cause for anti rape or at least the ones who can agree that rape bad that rape cannot be pooh poohed away as a womens issue
2010009 confront your peers when they indulge in exploitative or brutal behavior non interference in such situations is akin to participating however uncomfortable you may feel speak up and interfere
2010010 vote for raegan even though he does not medically exist and is not even a candidate anymore
2010011 get over it it seems of all the bloody nerve aaargh you should send it to him anyway
2010012 for some reason i get the feeling that you are as yet unable to distinguish between feminism and misandry treading the invisible dividing line as you might be
2010013 for some reason i get the feeling that you are as yet unable to distinguish between feminism and misandry treading the invisible dividing line as you might be
2010014 ive had the unlikely experience of an extended correspondence with an independent single attractive well settled mother 44 in perfect shape etc drugged and date raped four years back
2010015 i got it up and need to stick it somewhere and i lack the courage confidence and or skill charm to influence the lady to accede to my desire legitimately which is why i roam around with a packet of date rape powder cached in my pocket
2010016 i got it up and need to stick it somewhere and i lack the courage confidence and or skill charm to influence the lady to accede to my desire legitimately which is why i roam around with a packet of date rape powder cached in my pocket
2010017 credentials especially in this case treating it as a debate
2010018 the second as discussed by some others earlier is the need for a male to flex his muscles at the hint of
2010019 i dont have an opinion and im incapable of having one so i just pick something and stick to it i am a sheep
2010020 literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason the opinions of others
2010021 another issue is that if they nerf one thing players will gravitate to the next easy thing so i think it is pointless to go beyond some basic sanity checking on things players run over and over
2010022 our main goal is to remove the cost barriers and get engineering graduates to apply for the licence
2010023 we want to ensure that every qualified person can succeed in engineering and encourage recognition of their skills we have provided the tools and we want all those eligible to use them
2010024 not only does a licence demonstrate that its holder has been rigorously educated is experienced and committed to a code of ethics it also provides the most effective means to make the holder accountable to the public
2010025 we want all those who have studied or are studying engineering to take the initiative and get licensed that includes engineering students and canadian and international graduates as well as those already participating in our engineering intern training program
2010026 our quarterly results compared to last year were below our expectations due to the dramatic drop in sales to a large customer despite the decrease in second quarter sales we are encouraged with the addition of a number of new customers so far this year
2010027 as with many us based companies we are finding that domestic conditions remain challenging therefore we are concentrating on the business issues that we can control such as tightening our domestic credit policies and reduction in both domestic and china expenses we also believe that changes we are making to our china operations will free up our domestic resources to better enable us to develop and introduce more new products furthermore given the value of the us dollar we are making extensive efforts to expand our products into international markets with the increase in raw material components the decrease in the value of the dollar and increased costs related to energy the stability of the antenna divisions gross margins in fiscal year 2008 is a credit to our supply chain management efforts as price becomes more of a factor for our business we have developed a strong foundation that provides a platform for us to execute on our plans for profitable growth we expect this to enhance our ability to grow while expanding our capacity to meet the challenges to enable us to support our customers with products and solutions that anticipate and address the expected pricing pressures of the wireless industry
2010028 as previously announced the company has engaged knox and co a westport connecticut investment banking firm to assist the company with strategic alternatives to unlock our existing potential and add value for our shareholders both from our existing assets and through future opportunities
2010029 the presence of too many foreigners gathered outside could create problems
2010030 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating
2010031 as china overtook the u s in february to become the worlds largest internet market with 221 million users the launch of jiapu cn is perfectly timed both to generate interest in and lead the online family history category in china
2010032 launching a chinese family history web site also represents a unique opportunity for ancestry to extend its global reach to those in the many chinese communities around the world who may already have access to the eight ancestry international web sites but not to chinese records
2010033 interest in family history has grown significantly in the past decade thanks to the internet which has made it possible for people to gain access to billions of historical records from the comfort of their own homes
2010034 with chinas clear sense and respect for its own historical identity we anticipate that many people of chinese heritage will enthusiastically take up researching their own roots and in doing so make new connections around the world
2010035 recently opponents of our states employer sanctions law made despicable misleading and false attacks on my husband and our family
2010036 i hope all voters in district 18 join me in supporting my husband for state senate and rejecting these misleading and false attacks
2010037 the promise of the future however wasnt enough for impatient owner and accused human rights abuser and tax evader among other things thaksin shinawatra
2010038 they said no problem you can send somebody by to pick them up and then we get another call and its whoops we dont have them
2010039 there is apparently no court order authorizing destruction of the property or any record of what happened to the property
2010040 there does need to be a court order for the destruction of any property
2010041 im the only one with a mainstream presence jennas never been on the cover of fhm theres a lot more things ive done than jenna i wouldnt say she has a mainstream presence i would say that she is the number one face
2010042 you dont do that thats gay on his part i told him that he was gay too for touching me in my private parts
2010043 i dont even know half those guys on the denver bench names
2010044 hope to relieve election year pressure by getting a democratic backed bill to the floor out of fear that the national rifle association will run hometown ads against their reelection
2010045 eco driving indicator incorporated on the instrument panel indicates the optimal level for fuel efficient driving driving within the optimal fuel consumption range the indicator is green it begins to flash when it detects increased acceleration before reaching the fuel consumption threshold and finally turns amber to advise the driver of their driving behavior
2010046 has been a leader in drawing attention to the threat posed to humanity by accelerating greenhouse gas emissions youd think that one of those challenges would be chinas newly achieved leadership in carbon dioxide emissions how china can developesustainably and what are the alternatives to their rapacious use of coal
2010047 easy solution to the problem of chinas emissions divide the country into 4 each with a population of 325 million slightly more than the uss 304 million co2 emissions of each will be about 1 4 of the us giving them another 30 years or so to catch up
2010048 im the only one with a mainstream presence jennas never been on the cover of fhm theres a lot more things ive done than jenna i wouldnt say she has a mainstream presence i would say that she is the number one face
2010049 im the only one with a mainstream presence jennas never been on the cover of fhm theres a lot more things ive done than jenna i wouldnt say she has a mainstream presence i would say that she is the number one face
2010050 she seems very pleased with how far the alliance had come
2010051 she gives us moral support encourages us and she takes back what were doing it tells us how much the state appreciates what were doing
2010052 its so impressive a real testament to the passion and dedication of these volunteers
2010053 she commented how nice the village looked and that she was pleased to be here for pirate weekend
2010054 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2010055 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
2010056 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
2010057 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
2010058 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
2010059 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
2010060 i dont know what function that serves right now in my mind it raises another set of questions which is whos minding the store
2010061 there may have been people who said this is going to be harder than you think this is going to take a long time but nobody said what we should do is collect a lot of money and let it sit there
2010062 i think some people would contend that because we have continued to make a sizable investment there hasnt been a proper incentive until now for the iraqi government to make its own investment
2010063 i admit that there is some delay in spending the money on the projects in the provinces and in the ministries
2010064 we have problems in this issue because there are lots of obstacles we face because of the situation that were going through were trying to deal with that were trying to improve things but you know the situation in iraq
2010065 thats medicinal you know cranberry juice is well cranberry juice and vodka is made from potatoes
2010066 dont it always seem to go that you dont know what youve got till its gone they paved paradise put up a parking lot shooooo bop bop bop bop

2010068 i hoped at one time to become commissioner of sewers for st louis county 300 a month with the possibility of getting ones shitty paws deep into a slush fund
2010069 every time we have to send a convoy out to refuel tanks or deploy forward locations it puts peoples lives at risk
2010070 occupation mom blogging is my new therapy and release from a hectic day as a stay at home mom and crafter artist i have a two year old son a 38 year old husband and a 3 year old chihuahua life is busy as most womens lives are and oh so fun i am a private tutor for several private school students a few nights a week stock my etsy shop paint shirts and onesies for local buyers as well and every once in a while i freelance as a lancome makeup artist
2010071 recent articles suggesting that ron is considering stepping back or that he will step back if the world championship is won by vodafone
2010072 you have a lot of responsibility but a lot of freedom also
2010073 we are making huge efforts to win races and this victory confirmed that we are on the right path it provided the entire squad with self confidence first of all however it was a team result the car isnt built by me alone ive got a lot of extremely skilled colleagues
2010074 ill give you a case of beer if you move or bring xyz
2010075 i need to get out there and do it too
2010076 its the difference between a black and white picture and a full color picture
2010077 in polls in which the question is something like do you prefer more drilling or more investment in alternative energy alternative energy usually comes out ahead
2010078 provide information about the relative acceptability of the alternative proposals taken separately
2010079 whether drilling comes at the expense of the environment or like in california the two are believed by poll respondents to be mutually inclusive that is a different question
2010080 it will be interesting to see if a oil keeps falling and b gas starts to fall seriously then what happens to that support
2010081 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
2010082 the issue could be seen as an early indicator of how much economic pain voters are prepared to shoulder in the transition to a cleaner energy future
2010083 where once there was nearly universal opposition to platforms in the ocean
2010084 some speak of them in a new way as a possibility an inevitability even a financial benefit to a region long fearful of the damage drilling could do to tourism and ecology
2010085 is critical of both political parties inflated rhetoric said he thinks the mainstream medias coverage has been
2010086 in particular theres been almost no critical assessment of the democrats continuing claims that theres not much oil to be found offshore
2010087 despite these rather obvious news events very few of the mainstream media stories bothered to mention the boom in the global offshore sector when talking about the drilling ban
2010088 have the vaguest understanding of just how integrated the global energy market is
2010089 so that leaves about eight billion barrels which is about what the world uses in three months
2010090 crude is priced in the futures market and future price expectations are what moves the market
2010091 what is certain or at least seems to me is that the media attention to the energy crunch in recent weeks and months has been commensurate with its growing importance in the campaign in business discourse in daily life etc
2010092 for years weve offset the electricity used to make silk with clean wind energy
2010093 green tags are renewable energy certificates that offset polluting energy sources
2010094 multinational corporations perpetrating underpublicized acts of environmental injustice against rural communities
2010095 pacificorps reservoirs are breeding late summer blooms of toxic algae
2010096 irrigators tribes and willing environmentalists have made great strides toward peace
2010097 passive teams end saturday without a loss sometimes without yielding a run and they can benefit from making sure everyone has seen adequate service time
2010098 even in my karting days i liked driving in the rain best
2010099 my brother sven and i always preferred to go out on the track when it wasnt that full and that used to be the case when it was raining and in germany the rain falls all too often
2010100 the normal remedies for economic downturns are necessary but even an adequate stimulus package will offer only temporary relief this time because this isnt a normal downturn the problem lies deeper most americans can no longer maintain their standard of living the only lasting remedy is to improve their standard of living by widening the circle of prosperity the heart of the matter isnt the collapse in housing prices or even the frenetic rise in oil and food prices these are contributing to the mess but they are not creating it directly the basic reality is this for most americans earnings have not kept up with the cost of living this is not a new phenomenon but it has finally caught up with the pocketbooks of average people if you look at the earnings of nongovernment workers especially the hourly workers who comprise 80 percent of the work force youll find they are barely higher than they were in the mid 1970s adjusted for inflation the income of a man in his 30s is now 12 percent below that of a man his age three decades ago per person productivity has grown considerably since then but most americans have not reaped the benefits of those productivity gains theyve gone largely to the top inequality on this scale is bad for many reasons but it is also bad for the economy the wealthy devote a smaller percentage of their earnings to buying things than the rest of us because after all theyre rich they already have most of what they want instead of buying the very wealthy are more likely to invest their earnings wherever around the world they can get the highest return
2010101 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem he must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it it would seem that it would be in everyones best interest to come to terms with the situation and do whatever is necessary to fix it there is so much at risk during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences

2010104 we are extremely pleased to announce leti laboratories as our targeted master distributor for the european market and look forward to the letter of intent which we expect to be executed very shortly
2010105 leti is a highly capable and well established company and has significant expertise in the european market our association is expected to provide a number of distinct advantages for clx as we pursue widespread distribution for our subsidiary products and additional medical diagnostic tests that we may choose to acquire or license leti will be an excellent partner for clx as we seek to expand distribution of our products in the european market
2010106 these numbers are truly shocking canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession since this time last year weve lost another 88 000 manufacturing jobs now in the middle of the summer were seeing people give up on the job market altogether this is a catastrophe for working families
2010107 the bank of canada must focus on jobs and families before apparent signs of future inflation and our government needs a forceful jobs strategy a made in canada plan to sustain and create jobs here moreover it is becoming more and more unwise for the government to carry on with its plan to swallow the employment insurance fund surpluses
2010108 im excited and honored to kick off this dynamic event that prolifics has created which will benefit anyone regardless of where they are on their soa roadmap
2010109 its nice to have men who are kind to kids and pay attention to them
2010110 they told my daughter she was lucky because i came to her school
2010111 so is the problem that women dont allow men to go to kids schools
2010112 do modern western women look upon a divorce and alimony child support as a status symbol
2010113 so is the problem that women dont allow men to go to kids schools
2010114 guys i love the way jeana tries to twist and alter any positive thing about men on this site
2010115 jump through these hoops and we may see it in our hearts to support you males
2010116 did none of those little girls have fathers i bet some or most of them did
2010117 jump through these hoops and we may see it in our hearts to support you males
2010118 guys i love the way jeana tries to twist and alter any positive thing about men on this site
2010119 they want a baby and theyre running out of time and they cant find a good man willing to commit
2010120 guys i love the way jeana tries to twist and alter any positive thing about men on this site
2010121 men are only missed when theyre attentive and not many men are
2010122 bmmg39 i dont think you have been on this site long enough to know jeana like the rest of us do
2010123 bmmg39 i dont think you have been on this site long enough to know jeana like the rest of us do jeana always tries to redefine things in her own terms when no redefinition is needed and when confronted with a straight yes or no answer will talk around the subject rather than answer the question
2010124 the quality of the relationships your children have with others is what is important
2010125 the quality of the relationships your children have with others is what is important
2010126 ut no one can remove you from your intact family without your willingness to do so unless theres violence or something like that going on
2010127 so is the problem that women dont allow men to go to kids schools
2010128 wild horses should not keep any father from being involved at school
2010129 youre joking right either that or you are blind to the injustices in what is better known as the family court system
2010130 if you are going thru a bad divorce custody proceeding that is one thing
2010131 i miss my husband when i am not around him he is the most attentive person in the world to me i miss my daughter when she isnt with me i dont miss people who dont show they care about me at all i keep good friends who are positive influences in my life and weed out those who are not positive which is why i dont stay here all that long when i do come here to see what is being discussed the negativity can be so draining
2010132 ut no one can remove you from your intact family without your willingness to do so unless theres violence or something like that going on
2010133 bmmg39 i dont think you have been on this site long enough to know jeana like the rest of us do
2010134 this is the value these kinds of people bring to the table practice in spotting the misdirection mischaracterization attacks and outright lies that feminism is based upon and learning to resist the temptation to defend ones position as valid rather than assuming so and demanding answers change
2010135 instantly vilifying jeana for noting that at schools and in most child care professions men in a position to shower attention is less frequent than female attention huh even though a few posts down you guys all agree there arent nearly enough men in education interesting
2010136 there are no solid statistics that say a non hetero normative family structure is more or less harmful that the hetero normative mom and dad
2010137 i am not giving you the silent treatment i just have nothing to say do you have a girlfriend
2010138 ut no one can remove you from your intact family without your willingness to do so unless theres violence or something like that going on
2010139 why is it so contraversial to suggest that men if able have the right and duty to take a more active role in parenting
2010140 i was talking about the men who are able to spend time with kids and choose to do so not the ones who are not able to
2010141 the family courts wont let us dont you know anything
2010142 the next president of our country is potentially the result of a single parent family so espousing about the inherent evils of the development of families in a way that doesnt fit one narrow constraint is borderline laughable at this stage in the game
2010143 and lots of people work women too and dont tell me that volunteering in your kids classroom will lead to pedophilia charges while anything is possible that is such a cop out argument especially for those of you who lament the lack of males in schools do something about it besides complaining
2010144 nah im not into that half a billion rand crap its not for me im quite happy feeling the pinch i enjoy recessions

2010148 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2010149 as a result of many hours of shelling from heavy guns the town is practically destroyed
2010150 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2010151 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
2010152 the georgian leadership has resorted to very aggressive actions he said
2010153 there are casualties including among russian peacekeepers this is very sad and this will incur a response
2010154 our intelligence didnt detect any regular russian units but detected heavy equipment and armored military vehicles coming through the tunnel
2010155 64 bit operating systems are becoming more mainstream and finally enable user memory to shed the 2gb limitation of 32 bit os
2010156 moreover the latest multi core systems are capable of simultaneous execution of highly complex workloads each commanding its own virtual memory space in that scenario the only way of avoiding data collision without writing back to the hard disk is the migration towards super high memory densities
2010157 ill pay for your childs education at a community college

2010169 consolidation already has brought us to the point where two companies control 70 percent of market revenue in an average radio market
2010170 we need to use every tool available to prevent further weakening of media ownership rules
2010171 while i respect the free market i believe it is a role of government to stand between corporations and consumers when the public interest is at stake we want local media to remain local diverse and free relaxing restrictions does not serve our citizens and we re taking further action to prevent these changes from negatively affecting our communities and the families at home we have heard from our constituents loud and clear on this issue and will continue to do what we can to maintain the diverse free and unbiased source of news that they clearly value

2010174 while posilac is a strong product for the business we believe repositioning the business with a strategic owner will allow monsanto to focus on the growth of its core seeds and traits business while ensuring that loyal dairy farmers continue to receive the value of posilac in their operations
2010175 weve literally loved everything about the hd 4850 since its release
2010176 one of those areas is the central coast of california because its one of the most seismically active areas on earth oil companies themselves say we should not be drilling oil on earthquake faults
2010177 big oil has refused to do it big oil should be required to execute the leases they have
2010178 hr 6578 tapped the reserve to remove low sulfur fuels and then immediately backfilled it with bunker oil which takes longer to refine

2010183 the antiscience agenda is visible as early as kindergarten with its infantile versions of the diversity agenda and its early budding of self esteem lessons
2010184 we also have immersed a generation in wall to wall promotion of diversity and multiculturalism as being the worthiest form of educational endeavor
2010185 obsession with the sex and race of scientists is just one more indication of how american higher education has swung into orbit around the neutron star of identity politics
2010186 i have a hard time understanding where omalley gets the nerve to attack john mccain on energy policy
2010187 electricity rates have risen exponentially during omalleys governorship despite his campaign promise to take on bge and stop the rate hikes this broken promise is just one of many examples of the failed leadership that marylanders have grown accustomed to under omalley now it looks like omalley is on the road wholeheartedly backing barack obamas energy plan
2010188 john mccains plan is to combine careful domestic drilling with research and development of renewable energies like solar wind and biofuel its a comprehensive plan that will give relief to working families now while securing our long term energy future
2010189 if obama isnt bothered by martin omalleys broken promises on energy voters have to wonder if they can trust any of obamas promises on energy independence
2010190 mod admits that a large slice of its savings resulted from the sale of qinetiq to the private sector

2010193 hey you know i was just in kindergarten when you started working here
2010194 men are that way because thats the way men are
2010195 why is it necessary for humans to indulge in unspeakable amounts of brutality and oppression to maintain patriarchy
2010196 women through the ages have been standing up for their rights and speaking up against male dominance and coercion
2010197 essentialism ignores the prominent role that fear plays in most mens lives it ignores the fact that the driving force behind the system of patriarchy is a compelling association between fear and control specifically male control

2010202 kinda expressions plastered on their faces ohhh the joy how i wish i could be there to see their reactions
2010203 whether you like it or not gone are the days of roses hastily scrawled love poems and sweet serenades crooned lovingly outside a fair maidens window today women may pretend like they want to be courted by a chivalrous gentleman but in reality the chivalrous man has about as much chance of netting the girl of his dreams as helen keller has of winning a darts competition
2010204 stay indoors pine away for your husband whos at war and pray for his victory or weep for his death

2010206 my style has changed because i didnt have any style
2010207 i think as you get more well known more designers lend you dresses but you always give them back like cinderella because you shouldnt be buying them 20 000 for one night as far as expensive stuff goes im not good at shopping im better at cheap stuff
2010208 i dont think im very good at figuring out female friendships i think theyre quite tricky to navigate i have a lot of friends who are guys and i find that manipulation and jealousy dont come into it as much whereas those things can happen easily between women
2010209 i love sienna i think she is a wonderful actress but weve been like two ships in the passing night recently i think thats whats lovely but also sad about acting you get incredibly close to people for that moment and as soon as its over you dont see each other youre away from home in this case wales its a very intense relationship for a while and then its not anymore
2010210 i told him producer cameron mackintosh that getting drunk would be the only way i could sing in front of everyone
2010211 at this particular time i probably am more comfortable with myself but i dont believe anybody who says they dont have any insecurities and moments of feeling completely crap about themselves i dont think it does anybody any good to pretend those moments dont exist but just now im having a lovely time

2010219 we are not part of the problem we are the solution
2010220 dont close your eyes we are here we are youth men who have sex with men and women living with hiv we are not going away
2010221 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2010222 it was like two of them flew up and then the other one kind of came and joined them then they all came into the middle i think these sightings are the same thing
2010223 i heard a rumbling noise and when i looked up i saw these blue grey lights
2010224 we thought they were lights from the funfair at hanworth carnival but im really surprised people could see them from the other end of the borough
2010225 my husband and i didnt think anything of it at first we just assumed it was a spotlight but later we realised there had been no beam and we got scared
2010226 this is not a joke im sure other southall residents can confirm the following i saw with my own eyes from my garden
2010227 a bright laser kind of light shot out for a second or two the vanished people saw this from all sides of southall some sort of light did fire out of the middle of the formation from in the cloud not under it people in old southall reported seeing a bright flash at around 12 55am
2010228 i saw the lights from my back garden in hamiton road feltham and know exactly what they were as i watched them for about 20 minutes or so
2010229 i called my husband out to watch it and i said to him that he must seeit as somebody is bound to claim a ufo sighting when it was clear forall those whove experienced these light shows before exactly what itwas
2010230 but four of us saw itand so did two dog walkers i met in the park there were threedisk like lights following each other and moving away then meeting inthe middle
2010231 wechecked to see what it was but couldnt find anything and the police werent interested i tried to take a picture but it wouldnt come out on my camera phone i just dont know what they could have been
2010232 the mod examines reports solely to establish whether uk airspace may have been compromised by hostile or unauthorised military activity
2010233 if required sighting reports are examined with the assistance of the departments air defence experts unless there is evidence of a potential threat there is no attempt to identify the nature of each sighting reported
2010234 these impressive results give us hope that genistein might show some effect in preventing the spread of prostate cancer in patients
2010235 diet can affect cancer and it doesnt do it by magic
2010236 certain chemicals have beneficial effects and now we have all the preclinical studies we need to suggest genistein might be a very promising chemopreventive drug
2010237 in culture you can actually see that when genistein is introduced cells flatten themselves in order to spread out and stick strongly to nearby cells
2010238 within a tumor it is hard to tell where the borders of cells stop so one way to measure adherence is to look at the size of the nuclei in cells and see if they are wider due to cell spread
2010239 and that is what we found demonstrating that the drug is having a primary effect on metastasis
2010240 what we think is happening here is that the cells we put in the mice normally like to move when genistein restricted their ability to do so they tried to compensate by producing more protein involved in migration but genistein prevented those proteins from being activated
2010241 this is really a lesson for researchers who depend on biomarker studies to test whether a treatment is working they need to be aware that those biomarkers might be telling only half of the story
2010242 the problem we have faced is that epidemiology studies that found men who eat soy are at reduced risk of prostate cancer death are all associative they dont prove anything
2010243 the only way we will find out how promising genistein is will be from conducting clinical trials

2010264 a life long libertarian alan greenspan does not ordinarily advocate giving the government more power
2010265 we need laws that specify and limit the conditions for bail outs
2010266 rather than circuitously through the central bank as was done during the blow up of bear sterns
2010267 our country has long since abandoned the notion that we should leave crisis to be resolved solely by the marketplace
2010268 the critical need is to formalise the procedures improvised in the case of bear starns this should ensure that in the future government financial assistance to lending institutions does not impact the federal reserves balance sheet and monetary policy
2010269 unless i hear from congress that i should not be responding to a crisis situation i think that its a long standing role of the central bank to use its lending of last resort facilities

2010286 never ones to pass up an opportunity to attach their obnoxious hippie agenda to even the most unrelated of cultural events peta people for the ethical treatment of animals by annoying everybody has seized last weeks horrifying greyhound bus decapitation cannibalism incident as the perfect chance to remind people about the atrocities of animal slaughter because when you think about it enjoying a delicious plate of smoked pig is pretty much the same thing as stabbing someone to death chopping off their head and eating their flesh somebody get a vegetarian tv actress to pose nude quick i think i speak for many when i say shut up peta

2010296 mr obamas years at the law school are also another chapter in which he seemed as intently focused on his own political rise as on the institution itself
2010297 embarking on five political races during his 12 years at the school
2010298 mr obama in turn could play the star in what even some fans saw as self absorption mr obamas hypothetical cases occasionally featured himself take barack obama theres a good looking guy he would introduce a twisty legal case
2010299 he was wary of noble theories students say instead they call mr obama a contextualist willing to look past legal niceties to get results
2010300 nor could his views be gleaned from scholarship mr obama has never published any
2010301 he was unwilling to put his name to anything that could haunt him politically
2010302 all of which may explain why as disturbed as i might have been by ronald reagans election in 1980 i understood his appeal reagan spoke to americas longing for order our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies so long as we rediscover the traditional virtues of hard work patriotism personal responsibility optimism and faith
2010303 were tinged with nihilism during his undergraduate years 1979 81 at occidental college outside los angeles there he played it cool and detached and began to confuse partying and getting high with rebellion
2010304 the last thing that barack obama will have to worry about next year when he graduates is job offers
2010305 obama finished his second year at harvard law school this spring and has been elected to lead the harvard law review a prestigious position traditionally reserved for a top student
2010306 its a great time to be a young black law school graduate if youre from harvard and in the top quarter of your class said obama
2010307 obama uses his ethnicity as a kind of unspoken metaphor for his political approach here is a man the message is intended to convey who is white and black liberal and conservative foreign and american a man above party ideology and the petty bickering of partisan politics
2010308 i was never lacking in confidence that my particular background would not be a barrier to me running
2010309 im not sure if this is a new lesson but it reinforced my belief that were not as divided as our politics would indicate americans are not particularly ideological
2010310 everybody is sort of a mix of what you might consider some liberal ideas what you might consider some conservative ideas but there is a set of common values that everybody buys into
2010311 everybody thinks you should have to work hard for what you get everybody believes that things like equal opportunity should be real not just a slogan
2010312 can you describe what change is what does it look like
2010313 i want people to feel connected to their government again
2010314 and i want that government to respond to the voices of the people and not just insiders and special interests
2010315 thats real change i want us to think about the long term and not just the short term whether its climate change energy policy how were educating our kids what kind of investments were making in our infrastructure how were dealing with the federal budget and national debt
2010316 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective
2010317 it is the first time all of this has been brought together in thisway
2010318 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2010319 probably more symbolic than it is substantive but i am very serious about it
2010320 im just not going to play that little game with those folks i dont need them and if these agencies want to work with them and do their cases with them thats fine
2010321 please dont try to kiss me please dont try to kiss me

2010323 what the heck lady i am in the middle of wiping my kids butt can you not wait a second or find another parking space parhaps do you not know that it is illegal for me to drive without my kid strapped into his carseat or do you want me to plop him on the side of the road so you can have a more convenient parking space and did you consider that perhaps other cars have came and went since i parked that it wasnt me that left the half car sized gaps in the front and back of my car
2010324 itll take a minute ive got to get my two kids into the car first
2010325 you know youre not the only one whos had two kids before

2010339 the maine law court has construed and applied maine law in a manner that not only tramples upon the federal constitutional rights of mr hoffman but also on the rights of the thousands of maine voters who validly signed his petitions and the rights of other members of the electorate who seek to engage in political expression or association through the nomination of non party candidates to federal or state office
2010340 but i guess it was ok for democrat tom allen to do it back in february
2010341 had the law court subjected the allen petitions to the same standard as were ours
2010342 there is a very good possibility that rep allen would have been denied ballot access as well

2010358 when i was your age we august 7th 2008 10 01 pm
2010359 yesterday we played a 14u game during which our second baseman loaned her game face to our third baseman so she could be protected from her very close position the second baseman is a good player with fast reflexes and good ball sense who gets in a good ready position before each pitch and who was playing deep just in front of the infield grass about 80 feet from the plate our opponents number 7 batter took a good outside pitch and lined it towards right center our 2b reacted quickly but did not get her glove completely up in time the ball glanced off her glove struck her square in the face and bounced all the way to the shortstop who caught it in the air and thereby recorded an out the 2b was taken from the field with her nose gushing blood emergency personnel were summoned and took her to the hospital via ambulance at the hospital where she spent the night it was determined that the girl had suffered a broken nose plus several broken bones around one of her eyes the girl underwent emergency surgery to reset her nose and take a look at the other breaks it appears as if her vision will probably come back but for now she suffers some double vision doctors claim that is to be expected in the short term though they are still somewhat concerned

2010371 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
2010372 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
2010373 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
2010374 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
2010375 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
2010376 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
2010377 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
2010378 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
2010379 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
2010380 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
2010381 brandons comments in particular contain a degree of unoriginality and stupidity that you only see in the most muttonheaded and imbecilic internet commenters
2010382 in fact ive seen him use at least a dozen variations of the word gay suffice it to say brandon mylenek is a truly stupid stupid idiot

2010404 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures old testament prophecies and foreshadowings and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
2010405 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
2010406 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise
2010407 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock jesus is that rock not peter or anyone else and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine
2010408 but if we walk in the light as he jesus is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
2010409 if you gave mice a new sensory input at the front end could their brains learn to make use of the extra data at the back end
2010410 the answer is remarkably yes they did not require additional generations to evolve new sight
2010411 each photoreceptor absorbs a range of wavelengths but the efficiency changes with wavelength
2010412 for example one photoreceptor might absorb green light only half as efficiently as red light if an animal had only this type of photoreceptor then a green light that was twice as bright as a red light would look identical to the red one but if the animal adds a second photoreceptor with different absorption properties then by comparing both receptors the red and green lights could always be distinguished
2010413 you could say that the original primate color vision system and the one that new world monkeys still use today is the poor mans or to be accurate poor womans version of color vision
2010414 desperately want s to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as a man gives the word
2010415 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2010416 meeting a person you like going out to dinner having a drink or two and letting nature take its course
2010417 and thats just the nature of democracy sometimes pure politics enters into the rhetoric
2010418 senator mccain has been quite clear offering more of the same failed bush economic policies and saying that he believes that the way social security works is a disgrace
2010419 we are here to say no to the same old politics that put wall street profits ahead of our families we can work together to ensure that social security will continue to be a strong and vital component of american life but privatization is the wrong thing to do
2010420 the solution is to strengthen the existing structures not to reinvent or privatize them
2010421 senator obama completely opposes privatization instead he has said he would ask those making 250 000 to contribute somewhat more as part of a reform to help keep social security solvent and strong for years to come
2010422 understanding the social security program what it is and what it could become is important to all generations
2010423 todays policy decisions affect tomorrows retirees children women minorities and the disabled in other words social security is social but is it secure
2010424 without math we wont be able to maintain our technical edge and the chinese will crush us in a few years

2010428 now that we know what many of these genes actually are we have potential targets to go after in humans
2010429 we hope that in the future we could affect those targets and improve not just lifespan but also the health span or the period of a persons life when they can be healthy and not suffer from age related illnesses
2010430 what wed like to eventually do is be able to mimic the effects of dietary restriction with a drug
2010431 most people dont want to cut their diet that drastically just so they may live a little longer but someday in the future we may be able to accomplish the same thing with a pill

2010433 precisely here where the question of truth is not the criterion of church communion and church division disintegration is greater than anywhere else that is to say precisely where the struggle for the right creed is not the factor which governs everything the unity of the church is more distant than where the creed alone unites and divides the church
2010434 thus for american christianity the concept of tolerance becomes the basic principle of everything christian any intolerance is in itself unchristian

2010451 may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations
2010452 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
2010453 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
2010454 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2010455 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
2010456 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
2010457 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
2010458 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
2010459 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
2010460 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
2010461 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
2010462 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
2010463 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
2010464 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
2010465 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2010466 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
2010467 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
2010468 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
2010469 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
2010470 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
2010471 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
2010472 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
2010473 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
2010474 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
2010475 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
2010476 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
2010477 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
2010478 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
2010479 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
2010480 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
2010481 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
2010482 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
2010483 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
2010484 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
2010485 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
2010486 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
2010487 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
2010488 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
2010489 what happens with animals when their skin is ripped from their bodies when they are still alive its heartbreaking for me
2010490 this bill will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools
2010491 this will harm children as young as children as young as kindergarten every may 22 ab 2567 will positively portray to children homosexual experimentation homosexual marriages sex change operations and anything else thats in the closet governor schwarzenegger should say no to this very inappropriate bill which has nothing to do with academic excellence
2010492 even if the rare extreme weather hits beijing in august people will not feel muggy
2010493 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

2010495 walked around baring their genitals with no fear of being arrested
2010496 these photos do not fit in with the slick national gay marketing plan to be sure
2010497 nevertheless the pathetic and debased spectacle is as much an offspring of the glbt movement as the current quest for homosexual marriage the latter radically redefines and corrupts an ancient institution created by god to order relations between man and woman as the basis for family life perverse events like up your alley mock any notion of right and wrong as the reckless pursuit of anything goes tolerance leads governmental authorities to enable and promote evil turning freedom into sexual anarchy while causing a breakdown in law and order

2010554 what character of franchise do you hope you never have to see again
2010555 while most disposable fast food cups including those made of paper are not easily recyclable mcdonalds choice of a styrofoam cup for a new product promotion is significant does the company consider styrofoam a better option than paper

2010564 were not gonna lie to you fans things are bad all over for quality horror cinema a recent article at moviemaker com pointed the current ills of the genre but let me expand on just how bad the problem is and possible solutions to the problem as the article pointed out young horror directors are having trouble cracking the horror audience the old guard directors like george romero although beloved by this commentator cant put butts on the theater seats and hollywood doesnt care about the discerning horror fan instead delivering forgettable terrible pg 13 horror flops one after another americanizations and remakes are disappointing fans all over the board and for the enterprising indie horror filmmaker chances are that your well crafted smart horror flick just wont be released theatrically regardless of how many awards you win of how much fan buzz your film garners

2010586 ncis director vance has informed me that your presence is no longer required

2010589 i may need nothing but there are a few personal items that i would not leave to my successor
2010590 could you ask abby or tim to have someone pack up my apartment into storage
2010591 when he heard that ncis was through with you he moved very quickly to get you into this new assignment he knows how well you work with the american military
2010592 what is this mission my father has prepared for me
2010593 we have been to your apartment and have packed your personal belongings
2010594 you are booked on a commercial flight to colorado springs the plane leaves in two hours

2010691 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2010692 shut up dumbasss what in the world is wrong with you barging in on this thread like that if i think a particular artist is not so talented then i should support him her cause theyre black

2010694 its tough to turn on the radio or the television these days without hearing someone hawking foreclosure bargains but more often than not these lists are outdated or inaccurate including homes where the owner might have simply missed a few payments or that are already under contract

2010700 youve been following me around like a hall monitor i get the feeling im absent without leave or something what gives
2010701 ive been trying to figure out the secret of your magnetic charm
2010702 your charm your inherent attractiveness whatever tell me colonel must you make a pilgrimage to the blarney stone every year to renew your gifts or was once enough or did your fairy godmother deed you with the power of attraction at your christening
2010703 ive been trying to figure out what makes you so impossibly desirable and its been driving me nuts because let me tell you the sum parts do not add up to the whole and that is not only blatantly unfair but it makes no sense either
2010704 your appearance it simply does not make sense okay for starters you have the oddest shaped ears ever your clothes never seem to fit you properly always bunching up at the elbows or ankles you are disproportionately long through the torso and you always look as though you are at least a day overdue for a shave even if you last shaved three hours ago
2010705 because the amount of attention that your hair receives borders on the ludicrous and for gods sake its only hair everyone has some and everyone and i mean everyone eventually loses theirs and your eyes well when you get too tired you get bags under them and they are the color of a muddy pond so why everyone waxes poetical over your hazel eyes is beyond me and you cant stand up straight to save your life
2010706 thats just it empirically this should not add up to a picture of hotness but it does and thats the part that i cant figure out that somehow all these odd components should en masse exceed expectations and result in a package that makes women titter in your presence and men want your approval
2010707 jeannie implied that i should ask katie to marry me because i wasnt likely to get a better offer because i was no john sheppard
2010708 but that seems like a pretty stupid reason to ask someone to marry them
2010709 and shes wrong you know about your not being a good catch
2010710 well of course shes wrong that goes without saying um how exactly is she wrong
2010711 can see that your uh component parts arent anything to sneeze at either
2010712 i mean just look at you youve got the most amazing hands especially when theyre in motion i bet you were a better pianist than your teacher ever gave you credit for and theres nothing muddy about your eyes you only see that kind of blue on a clear day at altitude
2010713 and you fill out your clothes just fine you should wear t shirts more often as a matter of fact i could watch you crawl under consoles all day long cause the view from the rear is kinda hot
2010714 so dont let jeannie get to you if you want to marry katie then ask her to marry you but only because you really want to marry her
2010715 oh thank god youre awake its about time do you have any idea how messed up this is
2010716 while we were off world the whole city went nuts on us
2010717 since we got back its like ive become invisible or something everyones acting like they cant see or hear me and if its some kind of practical joke then all of atlantis is in on it hang on you can see me right
2010718 oh great you cant see me either thats thats just great
2010719 no no no no no no dont do that sheppard not even in not funny
2010720 im fine she answered giving his hand a friendly pat but the truth was she looked worn out john nodded back willing to let it slide for now
2010721 do i know him because im drawing a blank here
2010722 i didnt see any obvious injuries when you were admitted but you didnt happen to hit your head on your last mission did you
2010723 as a matter of fact i think maybe i did my memorys a bit fuzzy about what happened on that planet and ive got one hell of a migraine
2010724 hello i am not a hallucination and whyd she call you major
2010725 you are a hallucination and she called me major because thats my rank
2010726 since i was promoted in 2002 and you arent real so why am i even talking to you
2010727 if i wasnt real would i be able to touch you
2010728 of course i can touch real you need to start focusing on whats important here namely me and finding a way to make me visible again
2010729 in some cases of head injury its possible for the brain to conjure up very realistic visual auditory and tactile hallucinations
2010730 when i was hallucinating about carter that time i got trapped in a puddle jumper at the bottom of the ocean the kiss we shared felt very very real
2010731 you hallucinated that you kissed colonel carter in a puddle jumper
2010732 your hallucination is telling you about something that it hallucinated about
2010733 what can i say im a very complex kind of guy
2010734 please youre about as complex as a connect the dots puzzle
2010735 hey youre my hallucination so would you ease up on the insults buddy
2010736 i only insult people when theyre behaving like idiots and would you stop with the hallucination thing already im a real person i do have a name you know
2010737 next hell be telling you hes related to dr jeannie mckay
2010738 looks a bit like her too now that i come to think of it though hes not nearly as pretty to look at he even has the same temperament as her
2010739 its time to tell rodney that visiting hours are over i need to take you for an mri
2010740 if you dont believe me just ask know who i am
2010741 and hes making my headache worse think you could give me something to make it go away
2010742 which one do you want me to get rid of the headache or the hallucination

2010751 i feel confident that the record ive built over the last 20 months is the record the people of the 2nd district want to see
2010752 i am interested in finding out how genuine they are that is the main problem i am not surprised at the size of the bid i always intended to get over 3 million
2010753 i have decided as a result of having this rather advanced prostate cancer and not having been able to work since january 2007 to have treatment done in london

2010755 this sale is brought about as the present lord has been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer
2010756 for sale as a whole or in part can include david the existing eccentric lord of the manor physically as well to a suitable purchaser
2010757 because these totalitarians just stopped my right to lecture and are swearing at me and who knows what they will do next

2010759 well i have investigated and the only thing i could really charge them with would be causing a disturbance but i decided to let them go with a warning not to come back to this store
2010760 do you mean that its not a crime to use gestapo tactics to break up a lecture and tell the author that he is a
2010761 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that but at the same time its something people feel very strongly about theyre concerned about where he would take the nation

2010878 boris is adopting or considering a number of policies that are likely to increase londons carbon footprint these include endorsing a 50 increase in flights from london city airport and considering a new airport in the thames estuary
2010879 in addition he has supported an extra river crossing downstream from tower bridge to ease traffic congestion which could lead to a rise in the number of vehicles on londons roads if this was a road crossing
2010880 despite recognising that climate change is one of the biggest threats facing london boris has failed to secure the team he needs to deliver on his promise to cut carbon emissions by 60 by 2025 this can only add to fears that he will seek to cut spending on climate change projects
2010881 by not appointing environmental experts johnson is missing the chance to build on the good work already being done in london there must now be very real concerns as to whether boris has any plan or strategy to maintain london as a world leading sustainable city

2010904 i am interested in finding out how genuine they are that is the main problem i am not surprised at the size of the bid i always intended to get over 3 million
2010905 i have decided as a result of having this rather advanced prostate cancer and not having been able to work since january 2007 to have treatment done in london
2010906 therefore i will sell everything up down here and move back to london
2010907 if by useful you mean blows something up then no probably not if by useful you mean of possible scientific value then its too early to tell but no probably not
2010908 a derivative i think elizabeths better at that stuff than i am
2010909 i am a scientist not a linguist and im not saying that i couldnt figure it out if i had the time but i assumed youd prefer i look at oh i dont know the ancient technology
2010910 it is nearing our time to leave perhaps we should document our findings so that we will be back on time
2010911 you know the drill no alien tech brought back to atlantis until were sure it isnt dangerous
2010912 there was a woman here just a second ago you must have seen her
2010913 how do you explain having the murder weapon in your hand
2010914 i could see them but they were sort of blurry i couldnt really make out their faces
2010915 not them i thought i saw a dead body on the ground just outside the room where we found all the alien devices no one else saw it and when i looked again it was gone so i thought i was just imagining things
2010916 well run some tests see if theres any physical reason for what the colonels reporting
2010917 was there anything you saw or heard that might give us some sort of clue what might be causing this
2010918 i didnt even notice at the time because i could understand them but they werent speaking english it might have been ancient
2010919 which fits with the writing on the artifacts your team found
2010920 well postpone your next mission until we figure out whats going on whether you have to stay in the infirmary is up to carson
2010921 these hallucinations dont seem to be dangerous so for now i see no reason to keep you here i want to be notified immediately if you have any more episodes and i dont want you doing anything that requires your full attention i dont need to be treating you for a broken bone because you got distracted while sparring
2010922 i wave a gun around at imaginary people and you dont think letting beckett know is necessary
2010923 im not taking this lightly john until we figure this out i have to relieve you of duty youll have no access to weapons and there will be a security detail with you at all times
2010924 that you pulled a weapon has no impact on the tests carsons running and you wont have the opportunity to do so again everyone knows what they need to know to work on this
2010925 like last time nothing appears to be physically wrong with colonel sheppard however were still running some tests so nothing can be entirely ruled out yet
2010926 colonel id like to keep you here for a few hours and hook you up to an eeg knowing what parts of your brain are most active during a hallucination may prove helpful in pinpointing the cause
2010927 excellent stay right here and ill be back in a moment
2010928 there was writing on a number of the devices your team found on m37 495 correct
2010929 i need hard copies of the visual records for each of those as soon as possible
2010930 aye but thats not the reason i asked you to come to the infirmary at least not entirely
2010931 you remember when i told you about the last time when one of the men gripped my arm
2010932 this latest hallucination i was locked up in some kind of cell with my arms and legs bound those same men
2010933 colonel sheppard was here the entire time he never left and no one other than two of my nurses went anywhere near him
2010934 our best theory right now is that the hallucinations are so vivid that the colonels body is manifesting physical evidence of what his mind is seeing there are documented cases of psychosomatic disorders but ive never heard of one this severe
2010935 we can treat the symptoms as they appear but the only way to prevent them is to stop the hallucinations
2010936 this is colonel sheppards eeg from earlier this afternoon shortly after you brought him to the infirmary
2010937 these are the readings taken during the colonels episode this evening theres a dramatic increase in the theta waves from that period of time
2010938 among other things increased theta waves are present during instances of lucid dreaming
2010939 i performed an mri and found something unusual in the hippocampus which is the part of the brain most closely associated with memory
2010940 ive spent the last several hours translating the writing on the devices you found on m37 495 one of them makes reference to a great injustice that must live on in memory for all generations i thought it was talking about some sort of time capsule or a written record but maybe its more literal than that
2010941 im going back to finish translating whats on those artifacts
2010942 it might be easier now that i have an idea of context
2010943 so ill be bored in your office instead of here
2010944 is there anything more you can do for me here
2010945 but i want you back here the second you experience any symptom whatsoever no matter how insignificant it might seem
2010946 im not quite sure but from the description it seems similar to the nanites we were exposed to our first year here
2010947 do the names kyran or lodan mean anything to you
2010948 i dont know theyre listed on the device as is ailanis theres no explanation of who they are or how theyre involved though
2010949 theres one other thing according to this the memory is supposed to play out over the course of a few hours
2010950 so why have i been experiencing it for two days
2010951 we can get a few hours of sleep and brief everyone in the morning
2010952 besides ive got my new friend nearby if i start seeing things again
2010953 scans indicate theyre similar to nanites but not the same
2010954 they dont operate using the same scientific principles an emp would have as much effect on them as it does on ancient technology which is to say none
2010955 why not allow the memory to come to its end
2010956 teyla might have a point once the nanites complete their task that might be the end of it
2010957 you said yourself it should have only taken a few hours and its already been more than two days how much longer am i supposed to let these things screw with my head
2010958 a hypnotic state is quite similar to lucid dreaming if colonel sheppard were put into a light hypnotic trance he might be able to access the memories under controlled conditions
2010959 you all know how much stock i put in medicine
2010960 but maybe its worth a shot weve got nothing else to go on and it cant hurt can it
2010961 you cant be forced to do anything against your will and you can stop at any time
2010962 first i want you to close your eyes next i want you to relax all the muscles in your body
2010963 colonel what id like you do now is think about one of the memories youve experienced over the past few days dont fight the memory it cant hurt you let it come to you let it expand beyond what youve seen before now
2010964 i dont know where it came from its not mine i dont even remember picking it up
2010965 they think i killed ailani theyre going to execute me
2010966 i came home and she was just just lying there and there was blood so much blood
2010967 i thought you were dead i told them they had to get help but they told me it was too late that you were already dead
2010968 no hallucinations in the past three days the bruises are healing my eeg is normal and the latest mri shows that the mass in my brain is gone
2010969 in that case i think we can find your team a mission let them know we have a briefing at 1500
2010970 its been quarantined in the lab for now rodney thought it would be best to destroy it but wants to make sure it can be done safely
2010971 these people went through a lot to make sure the truth was known
2010972 i agree what do you think about making your first mission a return trip to m37 495
2010973 now get out of here so i can finish my work
2010974 seriously it has been two hours can you provide us with another update for a company with your reputation im absolutely shocked at the apparent absence of customer service
2010975 what i cant understand is why do providers only understand this learnt its lesson two years ago why on earth amazon couldnt have invested in a similar system to keep customers informed is beyond me
2010976 they sound like a more folky all female version of the cowboy junkies
2010977 i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
2010978 set up political action front groups with no traceable ties
2010979 we are very pleased with our second quarter 2008 financial results
2010980 kerastick revenues increased 39 year over year driven by a 32 increase in u s revenues our quarterly non gaap loss improved by 1 8 million or 88 and our quarterly cash burn was reduced to 0 2 million we continue to make significant progress in leveraging our income statement driven by growth in levulan
2010981 we also achieved two key operational milestones during the second quarter of 2008 with the launch of our kerastick product in brazil through our partner in latin america stiefel laboratories and the completion of all patient treatment regimens in our acne phase iib clinical trial subsequent to the end of the quarter we announced that nicomide will no longer be marketed as a prescription product we are currently executing on plans aimed at bringing the product labeling into compliance under dshea and maximizing the value of the nicomide brand
2010982 for the remainder of 2008 we will focus our efforts on the continued growth of our core pdt business we believe that we are still in the early stages of market penetration with levulan and that there exists significant upside potential both in the u s and international markets
2010983 the vastness of the undertaking dawned upon its promoters and depressed them to almost stupidness
2010984 the shift now is from the dedicated sacrifice of individuals to open source or crowd sourcing where groups collaborate where individual users contribute and work together
2010985 now the efforts are coming to a head and the work will move forward in unprecedented ways
2010986 this is a global work where we havent started scratching the surface is asia the population of north america in 1750 was 2 million asia had 500 million in 1750 last week the chinese government announced more internet users in china than in united states many of them are accessing the internet via a cell phone there are now about 4 billion cell phones think about that in terms of technology and family history you are going to see some of the most remarkable things you have ever imagined

2010988 and our recommendation engine will get smarter and smarter as end users collaborate
2010989 our primary goal is to broaden the interest in family history to millions of people of all ages we want people to want to learn about their ancestors

2011000 employers have a duty to provide risk assessments under the health and safety at work act equipment and personal protective equipment must be assessed the fbu will not see fire fighters safety being compromised
2011001 since the fire service does not have a legal responsibility to provide equipment and resources for floods and water related rescue this cover seems to be being provided in a piecemeal manner as it is not funded by central government
2011002 but it is a tribute to our good industrial relations that in again highlighting to management their failings but being able to step up to the mark and to find the ways forward through our underpinning knowledge and expertise and the perusal of good industrial relations we were able to cause the minimum of disruption and therefore guarantee the safety of our crews and that of the public of the two counties
2011003 this expense of 518 000 is a mixed blessing it is the result of our stock price moving up 54 from 27 80 per share at the end of the first quarter to 42 75 per share at the end of the second quarter we are very happy for our shareholders that this increase took place however it does have the inverse effect of generating a non cash expense for the overall increase in the value of phantom shares owned by our board members

2011029 dont use unauthorized computer programs to submit pages check rankings etc such programs consume computing resources and violate our terms of service google does not recommend the use of products such as webposition gold that send automatic or programmatic queries to google
2011030 has anyone else noticed that after years of threatening it appears that google has now blocked wp gold from reporting rankings through their tool we called the wp support line and they said they are waiting for google to do something and have no eta has to when it will be fixed
2011031 thanks for the news this has certainly been an onging saga google has long been clear that they dont want to see automated rank checking so its not a surprise given that they sometimes serve bad data to automated pr checkers im actually surpirsed they didnt just start poisoning the ranking data too i guess that would be too much bandwidth though
2011032 can anyone tell why google doesnt have an official rank checking tool added to their webmaster tools for example no seriously theyre driving a lot of traffic through organic search and results of their pages are in direct relation to both the income of websites and web search ad campaigns its not like google doesnt have an interest in bigcompany not setting up adwords campaigns for keywords they already rank top 3 for on organic its a legitimate question and not some seo trick to see where a website is ranked at not only is it necessary in sem although which process any seo can script do manually anyway but also its a matter of transparency
2011033 but what about the wmt tools ive found them rather accurate i just wish theyd go back to the 1 week data thing
2011034 we are switching ranking tools i would rather not report on ranking and just report on traffic but reporting on traffic under specific keywords requires access and trust in a clients traffic analysis package some of the information now available on google insights will help but it isnt something that as easily digestible by client executives
2011035 and wmt gives the authenticated site owner access to that ranking data for their own website thats quite a different proposition than publicly offering ranking data to anyone for any website ranking reports for one site are one thing but offering to help reverse engineer the algorithm or at least key parts is another
2011036 just throwing this out there but i wonder if googles recent transition to a more customized search result experience dated 7 30 had anything to do with this unintentional or not
2011037 im assuming that the api key is being affected by this as well my api key will give back 100 results per day before it fails
2011038 we have to look at the cultural relativism and the gendered power equations behind that choice because most women will simply respond to an internalized gendering of power in such situations and call it their choice
2011039 but its the extended family which poses a problem sigh
2011040 it is a fact of nature that weddings are what women want so they can trap men this is just biology

2011070 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2011071 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns

2011116 the cables foamed polyethylene fpe improves its dielectric properties without adding weight the result is an astonishingly low 20 8 pf ft picofarads per foot capacitance a measurement typically associated with considerably more expensive ultra low capacitance cables
2011117 all elite series guitar cables utilize a stranded 20 awg hi purity oxygen free copper ofc conductor for reduced resistance and improved signal flow stranding the copper helps reduce capacitance and increase bandwidth this enables the guitars sound to retain more tonal character during transmission through the cable a feature commonly absent from lesser quality cables
2011118 the elite series cable lies neatly on the floor and wraps evenly for clean organized cable positioning
2011119 we spared no expense in the development of this cable but youd never know it from the price with a rich feature set and a highly competitive price we are extremely proud of this new product line im confident guitarists everywhere will find much to like

2011234 it looks like we may have flight four on the launch pad as soon as next month the long gap between flight two and three was mainly due to the merlin 1c regen engine development but there are no technology upgrades between flight three and four
2011235 on august 2nd falcon 1 executed a picture perfect first stage flight ultimately reaching an altitude of 217 km but encountered a problem just after stage separation that prevented the second stage from reaching orbit at this point we are certain as to the origin of the problem four methods of analysis vehicle inertial measurement chamber pressure onboard video and a simple physics free body calculation all give the same answer
2011236 the problem arose due to the longer thrust decay transient of our new merlin 1c regeneratively cooled engine as compared to the prior flight that used our old merlin 1a ablatively cooled engine unlike the ablative engine the regen engine had unburned fuel in the cooling channels and manifold that combined with a small amount of residual oxygen to produce a small thrust that was just enough to overcome the stage separation pusher impulse
2011237 we were aware of and had allowed for a thrust transient but did not expect it to last that long as it turned out a very small increase in the time between commanding main engine shutdown and stage separation would have been enough to save the mission
2011238 the question then is why didnt we catch this issue unfortunately the engine chamber pressure is so low for this transient thrust only about 10 psi that it barely registered on our ground test stand in texas where ambient pressure is 14 5 psi however in vacuum that 10 psi chamber pressure produced enough thrust to cause the first stage to recontact the second stage
2011239 the only untested portion of flight is whether or not we have solved the main problem of flight two where the control system coupled with the slosh modes of the liquid oxygen tank given the addition of slosh baffles and significant improvements to the control logic i feel confident that this will not be an issue for the upcoming flight four
2011240 well be regularly searching the part of the sky that telescopes on the ground are unable to search so it makes us a little bit safer

2011262 subs reqd it concludes here we use satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content these observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods furthermore the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than predicted by models implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes due to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated in short global warming is going to make extreme weather even more extreme than scientists have thought and this conclusion is based largely on observational evidence the study team analyzed satellite images of rainfall over tropical oceans over nearly two decades from 1988 to 2004 this is something that climate models had predicted
2011263 which suggests we are headed for a staggering increase in intense rainfall this has huge implications for both agriculture and human health

2011359 im looking at jobs that are way lower than what i was once making
2011360 the realty industry is quickly becoming a shadow of what it was
2011361 for those who remain employed their compensation has plunged realtors were also among the most aggressive housing investors many made the error of working and investing with leverage in the same industry something financial planners counsel strongly against
2011362 some members are saying there are too many realtors out there who are bringing additional competition and a shake up is expected
2011363 we do anticipate lower membership going forward since housing recovery is taking longer

2011368 the conditions in the market that we have seen over the course of the last 12 months are as difficult as we have experienced in many years
2011369 it would be wrong in this review to suggest that the market conditions over the foreseeable future will be anything other than tough not least because we are now seeing the impact of slowing economies around the world
2011370 for a very long time it was an excellent performing package
2011371 it gave the borrower a chance to manage his money if they qualified it was an excellent loan

2011373 3 percent of a 600 900k is alot of money
2011374 they dont feel the market will bottom out until the second quarter of 2010
2011375 freddie in the second quarter wrote down the value of its subprime and alt a portfolio by 1 billion freddie is claiming that they can hold these securities to maturity and not have to take a loss because over time the dire predictions of defaults on these loans just wont come to pass freddies subprime and alt a portfolio is about 130 billion think of that just 1 billion in writedowns
2011376 i think armando falcon a former head of ofheo said it best when i interviewed him yesterday
2011377 theyve only written them down by lets say five or 6 total over the past few quarters if those were sold on the market they would get maybe 50 cents on the dollar for these securities at some point they cant delay the inevitable about having to mark these assets down to their true market value they are now holding them close to book value based on the theory that these are temporary impairments as the market continues to decline into next year it will be clear that these arent just temporary impairments then the government will not be able to allow this forbearance on recognizing losses much longer

2011386 the only successful r e folks i know personally that are still active here in ca are involved in rentals one is a builder and one an agent but their income at this point is derived from their rental properties being property managers was once their side job they are still active as a builder and an agent respectively but with so little activity that the rentals are now their mainstay i believe they will both weather the crisis here because of that
2011387 just make sure you have enough for a decent lightly used apple cart
2011388 sales of existing homes climbed in fresno and clovis in july for the sixth consecutive month a sign that dropping prices and the abundance of foreclosures are luring bargain hunters off the sidelines
2011389 but analysts were quick to note the market is still fragile because more than half of the sales were bank owned properties and that sales typically increase in spring and summer
2011390 it doesnt appear likely that the foreclosure crisis will abate soon some predictions call for another wave of defaults in 2009 as more adjustable rate mortgages and interest only loans begin to recast
2011391 they will remain at relatively high levels through 2010 and gradually decline through 2012
2011392 similar sales patterns are being seen in the northern san joaquin valley which is ground zero for the foreclosure crisis sales are stronger where prices fell the most said andrew lepage an analyst for dataquick which tracks activity first time home buyers and investors are bargain hunting he said
2011393 lepage said increasing sales is a positive trend but that a strong recovery wont occur until the foreclosures begin to fade and the inventory of unsold homes shrinks

2011402 mortgages issued in the first half of 2007 are going bad at a pace that far outstrips the 2006 vintage suggesting that the blow to the financial system from u s housing woes will be deeper than many people earlier estimated
2011403 an analysis prepared for the wall street journal by the federal deposit insurance corp shows that 0 91 of prime mortgages from 2007 were seriously delinquent after 12 months meaning they were in foreclosure or at least 90 days past due the equivalent figure after 12 months was just 0 33 for 2006 prime mortgages
2011404 if everyone in china drove a two stroke moped it would use more oil than has been used in any year in history anyone who thinks oil is being driven up by speculators cant do basic math

2011479 my daughter asked what that strange light was over the a1
2011480 i thought it was a light rigged up by contractors working on the access road to the a1 which they had closed off
2011481 we were diverted towards the galleria where we stopped to watch this light which had the same colour as a street lamp except it was moving slow and steady
2011482 i thought it may have been a firework or aircraft but it was not like anything i have ever seen before
2011483 it then continued heading north into the distance until it became just a glimmer
2011484 the light emitting from it was hazy like looking through a window however i had the window wound down to make sure
2011485 i would be interested to know if anyone else saw what we did

2011499 kilpatrick was quite young when he was elected and the mayor of a city the size of detroit needs a bit more maturity discipline and experience than he has displayed
2011500 at a time when presidential campaign ads monopolize prime time we believe it is important to be able to provide traditional advertisers with a clutter free environment to showcase their brands and target marketing messages to a captive audience
2011501 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with sen mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut
2011502 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about sen obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate

2011512 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2011513 russian aircraft have bombarded territory in the vicinity of the vaziani military base near tbilisi
2011514 im sure pete is sleeping a bit better than he was nine months ago
2011515 it was looking for a while that federer would blow through the all time record of 14 grand slam titles when the swiss hit his 12th last year at the us open
2011516 i think pete won the majority of his slams at age 27 or below
2011517 you think it will never change for roger but the law of averages catches up nadal has improved his ranking is well earned he did something french and wimbledon titles in the same season that had not been done since 1980 bjorn borg

2011524 san bernardino county has 5 5 percent of californias population and only 1 3 percent of the state bar membership and has no law schools attorneys are often recruited from outside the county
2011525 counties in arizona with similar problems recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel have documented the advantages of initiating a loan repayment program
2011526 a loan repayment program would put monies aside to help the county recruit and retain qualified attorneys saving time and money by reducing the need for more frequent hiring and providing a significant amount of new hire training

2011562 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2011563 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2011564 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2011565 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

2011574 john mccain is a strong supporter of nasa and the space program he is proud to have sponsored legislation authorizing funding consistent with the presidents vision for the space program which includes a return of astronauts to the moon in preparation for a manned mission to mars he believes support for a continued us presence in space is of major importance to americas future innovation and security he has also been a staunch advocate for ensuring that nasa funding is accompanied by proper management and oversight to ensure that the taxpayers receive the maximum return on their investment john mccain believes curiosity and a drive to explore have always been quintessential american traits this has been most evident in the space program for which he will continue his strong support
2011575 a thorough evaluation of a combination of manned and unmanned missions what kind of exploration would be the most appropriate
2011576 words matter barack obama said he would pay for his early education program by delaying the nasa constellation program
2011577 the early education plan will be paid for by delaying the nasa constellation program for five years using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement auctioning surplus federal property and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the government accountability office and closing the ceo pay deductibility loophole the rest of the plan will be funded using a small portion of the savings associated with fighting the war in iraq
2011578 to pay for his education program obama would eliminate tax deductibility of ceo pay by corporations and delay nasas program to return to the moon and then journey to mars
2011579 houston is home to the johnson space center obama has said he wants to postpone nasas constellation program for five years should that happen the gap between the end of the shuttle program and flight testing of a new spacecraft would exceed 10 years years with no u s ability to fly humans in space would obama really force such a gap deterring americans from pursuing careers in space science and crippling the u s space program for a generation
2011580 how would barack obamas positions affect houston and its residents
2011581 when i went on my visit there was a great atmosphere and i love the metropolis area i had that feeling in my gut that this is where i wanted to be so i told coach steve kragthorpe that i was coming there and he was very excited like i said its just about the future and what i think is best for me as a player and person

2011587 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2011588 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2011589 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
2011590 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2011591 do you have something to pick up the dog crap
2011592 the dog crap i need something to pick it up its all over the place right where i have to put ladders and i dont want to be steppin in it
2011593 negative publicity may impair acceptance of our products critics of subprime credit and micro loan providers have in the past focused on marketing practices that they claim encourage consumers to borrow more money than they should as well as on pricing practices that they claim are either confusing or result in prices that are too high consumer groups internet chat sites and media reports frequently characterize subprime lenders as predatory or abusive toward consumers and may misinform consumers regarding their rights if these negative characterizations and misinformation become widely accepted by consumers demand for our products and services could be adversely impacted increased criticism of the industry or criticism of us in the future could hurt customer acceptance of our products or lead to changes in the law or regulatory environment either of which would significantly harm our business
2011594 there is nothing as useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all
2011595 to comply with state statutes and board rules to provide direction coordination and accountability for all administrators and to ensure alignment and link performance assessment and evaluation to the districts strategic plan

2011611 i am a british citizen who lives and is a resident in both hong kong and china splitting time between each at around 50 50 what i do find amazing is the perception of china in the media by people who have never even been to the place i have seen the changes here in the past few years and as mentioned oppression is not a major part of everyday life as portrayed people should come here first and then make comment all we hear in the media is the same as we heard about ussr japan etc many years ago
2011612 i agree that there are many aspects of china that still needs great improvements respect for its own diversity mannerism democracy etc but it is unfair and naive for outsiders to simply judge without visiting china and without knowing its history and culture
2011613 some westerners have a kind of inborn prejudice when they face orient cultures and societies they confuse all orient cultures together from a european heliocentric point of view how many of those people who criticise china hysterically have travelled in china themselves please comment on chinese governments tibet policy after you visit lhasa the gate is open to all of you

2011622 one percent of the people in this country control almost a quarter of the wealth and its at the expense of the middle class we want to reward success and achievement entrepreneurial spirit and the rest of that but this is not what a democracy is about
2011623 success achievement entrepreneurial spirit and the rest of that junk ill just add that since she left it off by mistake
2011624 one percent of the people control almost a quarter of the wealth
2011625 building a green economy that will lift people out of poverty
2011626 isnt he great this is the thing the idea of a new economy al gore says it very well but van just takes it home and he does that footwork and the beauty of it is that all these new technologies the new jobs the green jobs everybodys on the ground floor inner city neighborhoods rural america what are we going to do to create good paying jobs in america when they dont even reward productivity and when our productivity increases they dont reward it we have to have a different economic a progressive economic agenda that includes the new the greening of america the building of infrastructure

2011629 we wanted to test the ability of dietary caffeine intake to protect against alzheimers disease in a highly controlled study in alzheimers mice where the only variable that was different between groups was whether caffeine was in their drinking water or not
2011630 we were surprised to find that alzheimers mice given caffeine in their drinking water throughout adult life performed much better than alzheimers mice not given caffeine and very similar to normal mice without the disease
2011631 some of the current therapeutics being developed against alzheimers disease involve synthetic compounds capable of suppressing either bace or ps1 enzymes in the brain
2011632 it appears we have found a totally natural and very safe dietary compound for most of us namely caffeine that suppresses both of these enzymes this is the most likely way that caffeine is protecting our mice against alzheimers disease although there are several other possible mechanisms
2011633 the results of our study add alzheimers disease to a growing list of age related diseases where caffeine or coffee appear to reduce the risk
2011634 aside from its rich source of caffeine coffee is the primary dietary source of antioxidants for americans which may be why drinking coffee does not seem to increase risk of hypertension

2011674 a lot of times on the field i have to line a freshman up and then do my job

2011676 what planet is this guy from doesnt he know that 911 is only for married women to call after their husbands come home from the bar and issue a couple back hands for no apparent reason
2011677 i think thats probably pretty agreeable to do kids only
2011678 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2011679 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella

2011694 i have never felt at home in one demographic thats my struggle with management and my label getting everyone to identify that just because im african american that doesnt mean that im an urban artist i make music for people that have a sophisticated ear and are brave enough to support something non traditional people complain about the state of music but there are alot of diverse and talented artists with people that support them but their fans arent the ones calling the radio station they just want to see a good show so i said we should just do a tour and all of the artists that are going to be a part of it will have the same voice and stance on music so we janelle monae chester french the knux and i got all of our managers on the phone and started making a tour happen its in the very early stages but were trying to put something together

2011696 it is clear that minnesotans are united in the belief that any solution to our nations energy crisis that doesnt produce a single drop more of oil is half hearted
2011697 i believe the most effective way to lower prices is to increase supply while lowering demand
2011698 the great news is that america is blessed with the tools to affect both supply and demand if congress would just act to unlock the nations energy potential
2011699 right now wall street traders are raising gas prices with nothing more than the click of a mouse without regard for anything but their own profits traders are bidding up prices by buying huge quantities of oil just to sell them at an even higher price
2011700 for nearly eight years the bush cheney administration has turned a blind eye to this increasingly excessive speculation which has driven oil future prices to record levels and directly contributed to soaring prices of gasoline at the pump
2011701 that is why democrats have introduced legislation to curb excessive speculation and increase transparency and accountability in the oil and gas markets this bill will address the rising cost of gasoline in the short term prevent wall street traders from gaming the oil markets and ensure that american consumers are paying a fair price at the pump
2011702 over the last few months we moved quickly to deal with the effects of the downturn in the economy and housing crisis
2011703 how can we allow the energy debate to be bogged down in partisan bickering
2011704 i know the objections of majority leader harry reid do not represent the views of all democrats there are many on the other side of the aisle who do want to utilize americas resources and innovative potential toward a multifaceted solution that includes increasing supply
2011705 and most republicans likewise understand that compromises are going to need to be made for example by keeping the arctic national wildlife refuge off the table and making sure we invest in conservation
2011706 this spirit of compromise is what allowed us republicans and democrats to work together to pass the energy bills of 2005 and 2007 shouldnt 4 gas make us more not less willing to bring all good ideas to the table
2011707 i call on my colleagues both republican and democratic to develop a sensible comprehensive solution to this energy crisis minnesotans are confused and frustrated about the stalemate in washington they deserve action and i will continue to work with members from both sides of the aisle to achieve this end

2011717 well i dont believe that climate change is just an issue thats convenient to bring up during a campaign i believe its one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation thats why ive fought successfully in the senate to increase our investment in renewable fuels thats why i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise our fuel standards and i didnt just give a speech about it in front of some environmental audience in california i went to detroit i stood in front of a group of automakers and i told them that when i am president there will be no more excuses we will help them retool their factories but they will have to make cars that use less oil
2011718 i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists and won they have not funded my campaign they will not run my white house and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president
2011719 we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates my plan begins by covering every american if you already have health insurance the only thing that will change for you under this plan is the amount of money you will spend on premiums that will be less if you are one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance you will have it after this plan becomes law no one will be turned away because of a preexisting condition or illness
2011720 here is the truth fighting a war without end will not force the iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and fighting in a war without end will not make the american people safer so when i am commander in chief i will set a new goal on day one i will end this war not because politics compels it not because our troops cannot bear the burden as heavy as it is but because it is the right thing to do for our national security and it will ultimately make us safer
2011721 god showed me that he is first in my life
2011722 but i have a relationship with jesus christ and im only going to put my face on the floor for him

2011726 i had memorized scripture but i was surrounded by deception and needed truth
2011727 it had to be god that carried me through he showed me that he is enough
2011728 i didnt have my reputation my family or even shampoo and a toothbrush
2011729 i knew my kids were watching i knew god was watching
2011730 my goal was to be obedient to god not to win the million dollars had i not been honest i would not have been in gods will
2011731 my body may have not been strong but my faith was strong and the other contestants were starting to get it
2011732 i listened to the holy spirits promptings questions were asked but i didnt preach
2011733 when i said i believed jesus is the son of god i finally realized i didnt understand what belief meant
2011734 it is a firm conviction a full surrender and a lifestyle that reflects that surrender
2011735 god will not allow you to be rejected by anyone unless it is a part of his plan
2011736 it is the darkest when you are struggling but dont let go and give up before the blessing comes
2011737 if you allow this dream to come true not only will i tell them my story but ill tell them yours

2011742 bulimia alcohol drugs shes just a mess greg i dont know what to do we dont know anything about this stuff and between you and me i think her doctors almost as ignorant as we are
2011743 well im not a doctor but i know some stuff and i have some numbers you can call if you want to talk to a genuine expert but i need to know more than this slow down and take a breath and tell me whats going on
2011744 how the hell did she end up with this guy
2011745 and he had rich kids toys i think she just got hypnotized then of course it was too late
2011746 shed at least provided jim with an heir to the throne
2011747 she goes to a doctor but i dont think she tells him the truth the bulimias the worst i think thatll kill her she was down to eighty pounds at one point and she gets ulcers in her throat from the acid
2011748 you have to let the bad stuff happen or theres no incentive to quit you especially cant give her money all you show her then is that theres still an escape hatch if she is willing to take a lecture along with it trust me a lecture never even slowed me down when i was getting my drunk on it just gets filed under the cost of doing business
2011749 but shes still our daughter we have to do something
2011750 the pain and embarrassment of trying to somehow keep going got so bad that i guess that the pain i knew i was looking at if i tried to stop started to look good at least stopping finally looked like an option i knew sobering up would hurt dont kid yourself we know we know in our hearts what we are we know we eventually have to stop we know stoppings going to suck marianne knows it too thats not what denial is denial is when you tell yourself that you arent quite that bad yet that you can keep going a little while longer or maybe when you are telling yourself that it doesnt matter anyway because nobody cares what you do and youre not hurting anybody
2011751 denial is its trying to keep making it work even when you can feel it going bad for you because drinking dope what everyone forgets is that in the beginning it really works for us people like marianne and me and even when it starts to go bad it still gets the job done its the one thing that shuts up the voice in your head saying all those shitty things its the consequences that come along with doing it that cause all the trouble
2011752 i can understand that i guess we help her and there arent any consequences
2011753 if you want her to clean up then being loaded has to hurt
2011754 intervention is supposed to accelerate that make getting loaded hurt more the more unbearable you make it the faster she looks at cleaning up dont be afraid to be mean dont be afraid to embarrass her were deathly afraid of that why do you think so much of an addicts life is about covering up and lying
2011755 tell her that be rude drama gets you nowhere but you can move mountains with sarcasm
2011756 you have a job you actually are doing real stuff its like you just picked up where you left off
2011757 thousands in debt pissed away a free ride through college colleges actually there was more than one burned a lot of bridges i made a mess its going to take years to clean up

2011761 did you even look at the stuff i produced the last time i tried to write something im still ashamed your mother saw it
2011762 it was permeated with drinking everyone in that story was drinking or wishing they had a drink or thinking they needed to get drunk or whatever it was just embarrassing
2011763 youre the one thats always talking about not trying being the only bad thing i love that you come and see me but you know what i miss more than anything your letters write me something

2011792 oci creates the false impression that the only sensible thing that you can do with a law degree is work at an amlaw 100 firm dont be fooled
2011793 the same is true for most prestigious jobs whether it is federal judgeships or partnerships at big law firms
2011794 but even if you dont its no big deal seriously oci creates the false impression that the only sensible thing that you can do with a law degree is work at an amlaw 100 firm dont be fooled

2011811 the compensation sent to the packers could be steep but only if favre pays off for the jets in the win column the framework of the deal first reported by the nfl network is that he will cost the jets a conditional fourth round pick in 2009 if he takes 50 percent of the snaps this season the packers will get a third round pick at 70 percent of the snaps and if the jets qualify for the playoffs the packers receive a second rounder if favre takes 80 percent of the snaps and the jets make the super bowl the packers receive a first rounder if favre retires after one year and the packers get the jets first round pick the packers will send the jets a fifth rounder in 2010 favre must play in at least 50 percent of one playoff game for the packers to get that compensation the nfl network said an odd though not from the packers standpoint caveat to the trade stipulates that if the jets were to turn around and deal favre to any nfc north team the jets would have to surrender three no 1 picks to the packers the trade also includes provisions preventing a trade to another team if that new team were to trade him to the nfc north the nfl network said

2011814 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2011815 i took a simple picture of a very unusual natural phenomena and inadvertently snapped a ufo at the same time the worldwide media interest has been incredible with the story cropping up in many countries i am just gobsmacked by it all
2011816 this is definitely something that was caught by the camera as the pixelation surrounding the object matches perfectly with the surrounding pixelation
2011817 this one appears to be a metal type object in my opinion copper in colour goldish perhaps when you zoom into it you can notice a distinct whitish contrail type of thing but not entirely sure of what it might be
2011818 there appears to be some sort of white trail behind the image leading towards the bottom left of the image
2011819 if this trail was going from right to left appearing and emanating from the left side of the object it would indicate that this object is moving towards the right but i think its actually moving towards the tornado and not away from it this is kind of strange since the whitish trail actually seems to emanate directly from under the entire object and stretching slightly to the bottom left
2011820 i have seen similar images before but as ive left the mod i no longer have access to the specialist equipment and experts that might help solve the mystery
2011821 i hate to say or even suggest this since the source sounds legitimate but this could also be a movement blur from an object being thrown towards the tornado and then someone snapping a picture of it
2011822 the object being copper in colour could mean it was a coin of some sort or possibly a stone or rock i know its really hard to say for sure what this object is is it a ufo well i would have to say yes it is unidentified it is flying and it is an object
2011823 is it et visitors checking out a nearby weather event im not sure about that one if i was to keep my suggestion terrestrial i would say its some sort of coin metallic or smooth stone type object being thrown towards the tornado then someone shooting a picture
2011824 or even someone shooting the picture and by chance this object was caught as someone was throwing something towards the tornado which could also be the answer here
2011825 people have said to me that is a wonderful ufo shot and one of the best they have ever seenn yet this was pure coincidence
2011826 i am just a local pagan author who was out at the time fishing with my daughter in the countryside and now i have become the centre of a substantial ufo axis

2011832 its terrible to end up on a list like that period

2011836 how challenging a route can you follow and how far can you get on it
2011837 this past year i have designed and coached the first competitive climbing team in bellingham
2011838 its for ages 9 to 19 and essentially they come to the y twice a week to train on a team and theyre required to come once by themselves also
2011839 its designed to physically and mentally prepare them for competitions which are held every other saturday usually in seattle or portland
2011840 it has been going on for a while but its relatively new as far as sports go
2011841 ive been climbing for six years come this september and even in the past six years its exploded its become way more organized and more and more efficient
2011842 i really struggled in the semifinals so i ended up placing fifth but that was good enough to get me on the team and that was my goal
2011843 it was the most stressful competition in my life i was just relieved to be finished the happiness came later
2011844 the primary reason im going is because my coach has been extraordinarily patient with me wanting to pursue speed climbing
2011845 shes come up with time in her schedule to help me train for nationals and now for worlds and endless coaching and training strategies to help me succeed
2011846 the far left environmentalists are not going to like this and maybe its not politically correct but nuclear energy is a sure way to s energy independence nuclear power can make free from middle eastern oil cartels
2011847 but tom udall and the extreme environmentalists oppose nuclear energy and offshore drilling thats bad for tom udall and the radical environmentalists are in our way
2011848 tom udall opposes nuclear and domestic oil drilling i support them its just that simple
2011849 the prospects for nuclear energy as an option are limited
2011850 a new generation of nuclear power plants is on the drawing boards in the u s but the projected cost is causing some sticker shock 5 billion to 12 billion a plant double to quadruple earlier rough estimates

2011866 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis during menstruation telomeres normally shorten in length with each cycle of cell division until they reach a certain length at which they can no longer divide an enzyme called telomerase can extend the length of the telomeres so that they can continue to divide and this can happen in some special cells such as sperm and egg cells but not normally in cells that make up the organs of the body our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area

2011870 what are the motivations of the people involved the alderman
2011871 this is my opinion and im basing on what joe moore told me i think joe moores motivation his spoken motivation is to have the best of all possible facilities in his community i think that he also had the motivation whether he admits it or not and he wont admit it is he wanted to annoy and aggrevate his opposition
2011872 in the last aldermanic election it came down to a relative handful of votes so the ward is pretty much split i would argue that the residents are well served by this division i envy the 49th ward i wish other wards had similar divisions theres healthy debate theres a check and a balance the alderman doesnt just have unchecked power and in too many wards the aldermen do have unchecked power so i would say the 49th ward is served well by this even if it frustrates joe moore
2011873 we have no intention of giving up our leadership in trucks
2011874 fuel economy will be a reason to buy no longer a reason to reject ford vehicles

2011878 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011
2011879 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isn t true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obama s plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime
2011880 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011
2011881 the mccain campaign obviously senses the pulse of some polls
2011882 mccain claims in an ad released today that obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family but when it comes to promises its worth pointing out that according to the non partisan tax policy centers analysis of both candidates proposed plans obama would cut taxes for those making in the range of 38 000 to 66 000 three to almost eight times more than mccain would under obamas plan according to the center by 2009 those making 37 595 would see an average increase in their income of 3 6 or a tax cut of 892 those making an average of 66 354 would see an increase in their income of 2 4 or a tax cut of 1 042 on the other hand under mccains plan those making 37 595 would see an increase in their income of only about 0 5 or 113 tax cut those making 66 354 would see only an increase of 0 7 in their income or a tax break of 319
2011883 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2011884 senator mccain s tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes
2011885 in marked contrast senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
2011886 using tactics that he earlier foreswore mccain continues to misrepresent senator obamas record
2011887 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isn t true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obama s plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime
2011888 i was at a dinner recently with 8 people 7 of whom were obama supporters not one of them could name a single significant piece of legislation authored by senator obama now i m sure that some here will go visit obama s website and find some bill that he co sponsored but the point here is that most voters are completely unaware of anything significant he has done
2011889 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2011890 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance

2011907 she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2011908 we believe in one baptism for the forgiveness of sin
2011909 the bigger issue is whether or not the republican party in this state is going to become the republican party of john mccain and jon kyl or the republican party of russell pearce and that is a battle that unfortunately we have to have because we have to cleanse our own house
2011910 if we allow the fringe element of the russell pearce j d hayworth john birch society wing of the party to become the dominant voice as to what the republican party in arizona believes we will be a minority party for a very long time in this state this campaign is by far and away one of the smallest clients we have thats not why i did it i did it because i believe somebody needed to stand up and ask the question of what we want the republican party in arizona to stand for what russell pearce wants it to stand for is not what i want it to stand for
2011911 is a political initiative meant to satisfy conservatives in congress who have played to fears about all immigrants being terrorists criminals and living off the dole

2011914 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
2011915 because of disapproving signals being given from senator barack obama s presidential campaign for outside efforts
2011916 a new democratic leaning group that is looking to intimidate potential donors to conservative 527 groups

2011926 throwing the ball wasnt very solid at first during the second drive we got a couple first downs and moved the ball we were able to change field position we still have some work to do and thats what the preseason is all about getting the kinks out and finding out what we need to work on

2011943 ive made it very clear that im supporting senator obama
2011944 and were working cooperatively on a lot of different matters but delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission

2011977 he has a tendency to overstride a little bit and thats when the ball sails on him a little bit
2011978 he knows that he didnt have a lot of that in spring
2011979 i told him the 65 is good and all that stuff but really how they judge quarterbacks is wins and losses

2012208 it doesnt surprise me that outsiders become frustrated taha sticks by his policy of equal partnership that means palestinians must be involved at every step
2012209 fully justified and adds more social value to the project
2012210 nashef and many other palestinian political activists have obviously read it
2012211 the fact of the matter is the palestinians have something completely different to offer in the debate on ancient israel which seems to threaten the ideological basis of bar the american popular magazine biblical archaeology review which turned down this piece wgd they simply exist and they have always existed on the soil of palestine

2012241 two hundred thirty five journalists donated to democrats just 20 gave to republicans a margin greater than 10 to 1 an even greater disparity 20 to 1 exists between the number of journalists who donated to barack obama and john mccain

2012252 allowing them weapons with a possible withdrawal of israeli forces from that side of the city is a recipe for disaster
2012253 israel has to understand that our security has to be in israeli hands they cannot put the security of israelis living in hebron or anywhere else into the hands of our enemies
2012254 people say you ran the campaign in nablus and the israelis finished it
2012255 if the aim is law enforcement we are with it 100 percent but if it is to eliminate the resistance or factions opposed to the palestinian authority we are against it

2012332 on january 31 1971 members of vietnam veterans against the war vvaw met in a detroit hotel to discuss war crimes they claimed to have participated in or witnessed during their combat tours in vietnam
2012333 in april 1971 the vvaw stormed washington in a week long protest at its height spokesman john kerry went before the senate committee on foreign relations to accuse the united states military of committing massive numbers of war crimes in vietnam the appearance launched kerrys political career the charges he made shocked and sickened a nation changed the course of a war and stained the reputation of the american military for decades

2012342 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
2012343 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank

2012377 the discipline which makes the colleagues of a strong organization effective in operations is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment on the contrary such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make a strong organization it is possible to impart guidance and to give directions in such a manner and such a tone of voice to inspire in a colleague the feeling of an intense desire to obey while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentments and a desire to disobey the one mode or other of dealing with colleagues springs from the corresponding spirit in the breast of the leader he who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself while he who feels and hence manifests disrespect towards others especially his subordinates cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself
2012378 he who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself

2012407 why doesnt she get that the bible says the husband is the head
2012408 the husband is the noggin of the wife just as christ is the noggin of the church

2012418 i know that this board understands the urgency of the companys current circumstances and has the experience and capacity to promptly take the corrective actions that are needed i would like to thank the shareholders who have overwhelmingly stated their support
2012419 one of the primary tasks of the new board is to immediately implement the capital plan that has been developed for the company if successful our efforts to raise and inject significant amounts of new regulatory capital will provide the company with the liquidity and capital to maintain flexibility for its operations by restoring the companys capital to the levels desired by the new board the company will regain the ability to respond to market opportunities while it takes all necessary steps to strengthen its balance sheet in this challenging economic environment we will continue to work with the previously identified financial advisors which include friedman billings ramsey amp co inc howe barnes hoefer arnett inc and sandler oneill to accomplish this important task
2012420 we know management has been diligent in identifying and addressing weaknesses in its loan portfolio and that appropriate steps are being taken the new board will continue to support vineyards efforts to accelerate the completion of this important process through the resources provided by the company following implementation of the capital plan the ability of the company to execute its proposed capital plans will depend on a number of factors including market conditions at the time returning the company to stable and consistent operations is paramount i am confident that the new board has the tools resources and desire to accomplish this important endeavor the board will continue to be focused on the execution of the companys strategic initiatives in a very challenging economic market place while rebuilding shareholder value and confidence

2012436 the pill as pollutant and other environmental menaces the left ignores
2012437 why dont we have more outcries about hormones and campaigns to save the fish populations why arent environmentalists lobbying on
2012438 maybe because the source of these chemicals is not some corporate polluter but something a little more dear to the left human birth control pills morning after pills and abortion pills
2012439 by any standard typically used by environmentalists the pill is a pollutant it does the same thing just worse as other chemicals they call pollutants
2012440 outright denial at there being a problem obfuscation of the science when strong arguments are presented attempts to deflect attention onto much rarer and less harmful industrial estrogen and ad hominem accusations in this case an allegation of religious zealotry being in the pay of the very well funded pro life industry i imagine the effort will be based on making it unacceptable to bring up the issue in polite conversation such that anyone who does so will end up stigmatized
2012441 the epa and fda ought to have the courage to do what their counterparts in the u k had the courage to do and label the pill as the pollutant it is
2012442 omg the water is turning people gay thats even worse than giving them cancer
2012443 i said it is possible estrogen in our waterways is being ignored by the left for more than one reason the obvious reason is that the bc pill is foundational to their interests
2012444 a secondary reason may be that the thought that estrogen in water may feminize boys is not abhorant to gays why would it be it helps promote their gay gene theory as well
2012445 livestock waste has been linked to six miscarriages in women living near a hog factory in indiana
2012446 or would you just ignore deny that the fish in the rivers and in lake tahoe are actually getting sexually neutered by these hormones in the water
2012447 we believe there are vast quantities of pharmaceutical and xeno estrogenic waste in outflows from sewage treatment plants and from sewer overflows and that these chemicals end up concentrated and magnified in channel catfish from contaminated areas
2012448 these findings have significant public health implications since we drink water from the rivers where the fish were caught
2012449 additionally the consumption of river caught fish especially by semi subsistence anglers may increase their risks for endocrine related health issues and developmental problems
2012450 jess i have a house next to a farm in wisconsin and i now the farmer well his cows graze on the open grass every day and live the life a cow is supposed to live he told me he would sell me one for 1000 i am thinking about getting a big deep freeze and buying one from him cause i know the meat would be the best
2012451 his cows graze on the open grass every day and live the life a cow is supposed to live
2012452 i do have a problem with baseless conspiracy theories though that are made in an effort to insinuate that if you just take away this contamination in the water the guys would just go straight
2012453 the point of the story it would seem is that environmentally unsound contraceptives are getting a free pass even while environmentally unsound other things dont because the left sees pregnancy prevention as an ultimate good thats a valid point that should be examined rather than beginning an inflammatory tangential discussion about homosexuality
2012454 evolution is a sound scientific theory note that i did not say a sound religous theory these are 2 different subjects entirely and should be treated as such you dont believe evolution exists just look at antibiotic resistant bacteria aka mrsa that in itself shows that everything evolves in order to survive
2012455 the problem is that michael behe and id proponants generally assert irreducible complexity without proof or evidence
2012456 behe has been criticized rightly imho for failing to consider the effects of redundancy on irreducible complexity the argument for what its worth that for instance the bacterial flagellum cannot function if even one of its components is mutated to loss of function fails if the gene is duplicated or if its function is replaced by another gene
2012457 sweet although i wouldnt be so sure about humane treatment the amish believe in mans dominion over lesser animals many own puppy mills dogs that live their lives in wire cages their paws never touching anything more than wire many rescued have had to be taught how to walk on solid ground dogs continually bred until they die in those wire cages
2012458 we might wonder whether the doctrine of evolution would qualify as anything more than an outrageous hypothesis
2012459 if you want to understand what id is and what it is not the best source of information not unbiased commentary i can recommend is pz myers
2012460 eliz no i dont believe evolution explains everything it does not explain abiogenesis maxwells equations or why there is something rather than nothing religious beliefs should be entirely independent of scientific beliefs there is therefore no need for your proposed third group
2012461 with few exceptions radically new kinds of organisms appear for the first time in the fossil record already fully evolved it is not at all what might have been expected
2012462 it is now indisputable that stasis occurs in probably a majority of cases of fossil species equally it seems beyond dispute that speculation macroevolution usually occurs so rapidly that the process is below the resolution of the fossil record
2012463 no wonder paleontologists shied away from evolution for so long it never seems to happen
2012464 the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology
2012465 paleontologists have the best eyes in the world if we cant find the fossils sometimes you have to think that they just werent there
2012466 oh no now everyone will think i inherited my dads sense of humor
2012467 this is not some archaic branch of the animal kingdom
2012468 this is our branch youre looking at your great great great great cousin
2012469 there must be something supernatural because i feel so strongly about it
2012470 civility must be rewarded captain and if its not rewarded pause theres no use for it longer pause theres just no use for it at all
2012471 and bmmg39 i for one would be very grateful to a murderer who murdered me painlessly rather than painfully
2012472 but who may abide the day of his coming for he is like a refiners fire and who shall stand when he appeareth
2012473 seriously scientific theories make testable predictions what does id predict
2012474 evolution from one species to another has never been proven and cant be tested
2012475 am i gonna look back and say god i wish i could have gone to that that concert
2012476 id rather be listening to my son sing songs id rather be watching him sleep
2012477 why dont all contacts show up when searching for an account
2012478 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2012479 my family was one of the first to stop using pesticides
2012480 three years ago we realised we were spending over half our income on chemicals it was too much we were getting into debt and the pesticides were making us ill
2012481 just when i thought i was out they pull me back in

2012489 quest is firmly on track with the growth strategy we introduced for 2008
2012490 we are experiencing a significant increase in new lending opportunities from quality borrowers and are meeting this demand as a dedicated mortgage investment corporation or mic
2012491 quests results to date are satisfying and include growth in interest income a sizeable increase in our loan portfolio based on good funding volumes a reduction in impaired loans and the payment of an attractive dividend
2012492 our ability to reduce taxable income through the payment of dividends to shareholders has helped us to increase shareholder yield and after tax earnings net income for the second quarter of 2008 is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006 during the quarter we also took the first steps towards applying for a deposit taking license this is a major initiative that if successful will accelerate our growth potential in future years
2012493 with estimated underlying security of 20 million on our impaired loans we expect to avoid losses and maintain our track record of credit quality
2012494 moreover because we are targeting to achieve an increasing level of geographic diversification within our portfolio we have confidence that we can continue to achieve one of our main objectives preservation of capital
2012495 from a capital perspective we have drawn down 66 5 million of our 88 0 million revolving debt facility at june 30 2008 so while weve been very efficient in using leverage we still have room to support the addition of quality mortgages including the use of syndication from a market perspective while were cognizant of the fact that canadian real estate markets are not as strong as last year they still provide more than adequate support for quest were particularly pleased with the reception weve been given in the selected locations in the ontario market since opening there earlier this year and expect our mortgage portfolio there to grow in the second half this complements our additional penetration into the saskatchewan market in terms of adding value to shareholders we remain optimistic
2012496 we know that people care about the traffic and road information that affects their drive the most by using the trafficeye canadians will have a reliable and convenient source of traffic information before they hit the roads
2012497 over the past four years kathy has effectively led canwests canadian broadcasting division through a period of strong growth and significant change
2012498 she has positioned the company for growth going forward through both her strategic initiatives and strong leadership we are fortunate that she has built an outstanding senior leadership team and leaves the business with great momentum
2012499 bad for the south bad for the north bad for the climate
2012500 i am disappointed and surprised that the broadcasters are advocating an approach that would not and could not lead to serious substantive and enforceable terms of trade agreements
2012501 we have been ready and willing even eager to negotiate for some time but in our view a group negotiation can only lead to a race to the bottom with the resulting agreement loaded with high minded principles but lacking in specifics and substance
2012502 the more vague the agreement the less enforceable and less meaningful it is our members have told us that their sustainability depends on having terms of trade that are clear specific and binding on both sides we are far more likely to achieve those aims by negotiating with each broadcast group individually
2012503 his goreness managed to construe the judgment as vindication of ait
2012504 but but my modeling program that i wrote says it is so um
2012505 we are making significant efforts to improve results in edmonton and calgary alberta we were extremely pleased to see in the july ratings that our overall market share in these two cities has increased this is a very important achievement for us and demonstrates our ability to focus our efforts on increasing listenership
2012506 and while we continue to grow the company organically we remain focused on expansion plans as evidenced by our recent acquisition announcements and new station launches
2012507 when your head was underwater what did you want most
2012508 well there you have it thats exactly how much you must want wisdom
2012509 if you cherish a vision a lofty ideal in your heart you will realize it you will become as great as your dominant aspiration
2012510 still do not use these circumstances as excuses your determination should be so strong as to overcome any obstacles foreseen or unforeseen
2012511 c tait un homme dune finesse toute particuli re spirituel ironique dialectique
2012512 we thought the cartoons did expose muslims to hatred regardless of the context because if you look at the broader context in a post 9 11 world muslims are at a higher risk of being discriminated against
2012513 we werent shopping around for any laws we thought this was a good way to bring our concerns to the attention of the public
2012514 obviously we didnt want this to continue so another goal was perhaps to discourage people from further maligning our prophet and our religion we wanted this to have a deterrent effect
2012515 his decision is not that i have freedom of speech his decision is that i have his approval im not interested in his approval the only test of free speech is if i can write what he disapproves of with impunity thats what freedom of speech is to piss off some second rate bureaucrat like pardeep gundara and know that you have the right to do so because youre in canada not saudi arabia
2012516 the essence of what he is saying is that by approving of gay relationships rowan williams is making an attack on the family
2012517 i fear that the leaking of dr williams letters even if they are from eight years ago will give more comfort to those who see the church as a leftover from the past than to those who would like to see it stand up boldly for the values on which it was built
2012518 he suggests that because of williams stance or the apparent equivocal nature of his stance on gay relationships and the clergy there will soon be an inexorable movement for britain to become
2012519 where life had no value death sometimes had its price
2012520 these are more and more not the movies i fell in love with and i wonder if people watching them ten years from now will even be seeing the same film i did or if greedo will forever be shooting first if peking opera blues will end with a long pause instead of title cards telling us the fate of the main characters and if tony leung will drink his coffee in silence
2012521 the fact is that coal has doubled in cost in the last year alone dramatically affecting aep ohios costs
2012522 the tools given to us by the states new energy plan allow us to phase in those fuel price increases over time so that unlike the spikes ohioans see in so many products aep ohios rate increases are spread out to be made more affordable
2012523 but i na vely believe that mccain as president would flip flop flip back to his original position
2012524 triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago
2012525 wind power may be the only form of new generation with large scale near term potential whose cost is comparable to existing national electricity rates and thus much cheaper than new coal or new nuclear
2012526 aep demands 45 rate increase for ohio what all america can look forward to under mccain
2012527 the research for the cpuc puts the cost of power from coal gasification with carbon capture and storage at 16 9 cents per kwh almost double current electricity prices
2012528 would do well to consider how defiance of the world court ruling will affect the safety of americans abroad who rely on the same treaty protections that texas violated in these cases
2012529 american officials can provide a number of services for americans in trouble to assure proper and fair treatment and on countless occasions u s consular officials have interceded with foreign authorities to protect the rights of wrongly detained americans but in order to secure this access for americans traveling abroad the united states had to ensure that it would provide access for foreigners in the united states this is what it did in ratifying the treaty
2012530 given the issues at stake for all americans it is only right that congress and the texas legislature be given the opportunity to ensure our nation lives up to the promises it made to its treaty partners

2012539 despite significant economic headwinds in the u s and european consumer travel markets we nearly matched last years profits for the second quarter because of our efficiency initiatives and especially strong performance by u s car rental which generated double digit earnings growth in a difficult demand and pricing environment our results were affected by inflation in key areas including fuel vehicle damage and concession fees we are accelerating our efficiency initiatives and now expect to reduce expenses by 300 million this year to help overcome higher inflation additionally we have generated 1 0 billion of levered cash flow over the past seven quarters beating the target we set before the november 2006 ipo to generate a billion dollars of levered cash flow in 3 years net cash provided by operating activities for the same period was 5 3 billion

2012559 in recent weeks api shanghais capabilities have proven themselves to be extremely reliable as the volume of aogs has spiked in the days leading up to the olympics api is particularly well suited to support foreigners traveling to the olympics as we provide multi lingual support and the appropriate import export licenses furthermore product can be delivered same day to beijing via more than thirty non stop commercial flights from shanghai
2012560 api shanghais aog support services are just one example of apis dedication to customer support and satisfaction
2012561 every api employee operates under the mantra that customer satisfaction is our only job security whether working from our u s headquarters one of our canadian locations or part of our team servicing europe the middle east or africa our api asia pacific and api shanghai employees stand by ready to provide immediate response and the highest quality to all aviation customers in the region
2012562 we were particularly interested in an enterprise wide solution that could give seamless visibility to customers transactions and product to all of our stores integration with our key internal systems and an open next generation technology platform was also critical as we position our strauss discount auto chain for continued growth in the united states

2012567 harvey zenk could have at least shown some remorse yesterday
2012568 the truth as they say might have set him free
2012569 i have taken away someone loved and cherished and for that i am profoundly and sincerely sorry i know i have hurt you deeply and wish i could take away that pain
2012570 ive taken someone away who was so loved and cherished and for this im profoundly sorry
2012571 filed out when the former officer was asked if he wanted to say anything
2012572 did you bring along a medical report from this doctor
2012573 have you obtained a report from him for the purpose of this inquiry
2012574 and i know that you and i will discuss that further
2012575 so for various reasons that i know we will discuss in greater detail
2012576 i also reviewed a memorandum prepared by commission counsel which fortified my conclusion in that regard
2012577 q research conducted by the commission and other lawyers that assisted us have suggested sir that the sentence that was imposed with respect to the manitoba jurisprudence was a fit and common sentence in this jurisdiction a i have reviewed all of those cases and i note what chief judge wyant noted which was that none of them involved a police officer and you have my point and weve had the discussion i believe that once the fact of drinking prior to the collision was taken off the table the fact that mr harvey zenk was a police officer at the time lost much of its significance
2012578 ive also had the benefit of reviewing a memorandum that was prepared for commission counsel and it caused me to conclude that in fact most provincial appellate courts have concluded that consumption of alcohol even in the absence of some evidence as to effect on driving but consumption of alcohol coupled with driving is an aggravating factor for the purposes of offences such as dangerous driving causing death

2012587 it will be very difficult to achieve but i believe it is a noble objective that over the next 20 to 40 years you might move to a non nuclear world
2012588 it will not happen easily or quickly but at least it ought to be put on the agenda
2012589 we feel very optimistic precisely because the demand for nuclear disarmament is now coming from across the entire political spectrum there are people in the united states like kissinger who many people in the peace movement might consider to be war criminals who are now very actively campaigning for nuclear disarmament not just issuing a statement but actually going out there arguing for it working to bring people on board

2012632 the new bell brand underlines that we are moving forward as a company and as a service provider with new services a new strategy and a new goal
2012633 its a straightforward and customer focused brand that directly supports the bell teams goal to be recognized by customers as canadas leading communications company
2012634 the new bell brand is clear bold and instantly recognizable and the advertising that supports it tells our customers exactly what we can and will do for them
2012635 the taglines today just got better and la vie est bell reflect our commitment as a company and as a team to deliver on our strategy and achieve our goal
2012636 au milieu de nulle part avec un gps la vie est bell
2012637 la vie est bell just works naturally we found that substituting our logo directly for the french adjective belle in the tagline was an elegant and absolutely irresistible approach
2012638 the bell ements are a fun and constructive way to put the bell logo to work in every possible way all of our television ads actually take place on a gigantic bell logo while many of our print ads carry portions of the bell logo
2012639 considering that we offer the broadest range of services in canadian communications that so much of life happens on bells networks that canadian business runs on bell its only appropriate that our advertising literally takes place on bell too

2012660 john mccain should stay positive he should choose a young and vibrant running mate but republicans are sick of bush bashing so that should definitely stop
2012661 every time he takes a cheap shot at bush or republicans im reminded why i dont like john mccain in the first place i think bush has been a great president
2012662 if mccain trashes bush one more time i swear i will stay home on election day
2012663 i dont think mccain should distance himself from bush per se but i think its wise to call washington broken
2012664 george bush is a great president but his perception ratings are lousy mccain has to distance himself from him and congress as well
2012665 mccains ad is valid but washington isnt broken just because of bush theres a very unpopular congress that seems to be going out of its way to avoid helping the american people
2012666 the ad was criticizing congress not bush it was a smart ad
2012667 the actions or inactions of nancy pelosi and harry reid have proven that indeed washington is broken
2012668 paris hiltons disrespect for the process of aging is upsetting satire is one thing but mocking mccains age is immature
2012669 the ad may have been clever marketing but paris hilton is still a bad influence on those who idolize her
2012670 who cares what that air head thinks about the white haired guy
2012671 i think paris hilton would make a great democratic candidate for president she has lots of style and little substance
2012672 i hate to break it to paris hilton but i think you have to be at least 35 to serve as president other than that i think she meets the qualifications
2012673 for gravel to incite a bunch of loons to find out where the prosecutors children go to school is beyond despicable you werent nearly tough enough on that whacky old man
2012674 do you think mike gravel still wonders why hes not the democratic nominee for president
2012675 because he doesnt agree with the prosecutor its now permissible to use vigilante justice in this country wow whats happened to america
2012676 if anything happens to this prosecutor or his family mike gravel should be charged with inciting violence
2012677 you let the senator spin out of a tackle he never answered your question about whether sami al arian is a good guy
2012678 while its entirely possible that this u s attorney abused his authority the way to challenge him is not to go after his family mr gravel should be ashamed of himself
2012679 i hope the spaceship that dropped senator gravel off for your interview picked him up right afterward and took him back to whatever planet he came from
2012680 as a former alaska resident of 35 years ive seen the good senator in action before he really became an embarrassment to his party and his state and he apparently is as witless as ever
2012681 those brits need to stop hating on mr t and pity the fool
2012682 mr ts positive attitude is infectious im always in a better mood after i see him

2012724 ideally you want another movie with heath without him catwoman but really think that one through give her a new take
2012725 catwoman needs to be part of it thats even more obvious now that hes living on the other side of life
2012726 it would be fun to see them put a spin on a less obvious one like they did with ras al ghul id be hankering for the mad hatter granted crimes about hats are a specialized field but if you take it back to alice in wonderland and give it a weird almost psychedelic worldview from that it could be cool in their hands
2012727 catwoman s such a powerful and sexual and strong woman and i like that but god i hope not as frank millers version of her as a prostitute thats the worst part of year one thats just frank trying to be outrageous it didnt ring remotely true to me
2012728 id like to see catwoman over the penguin not as a prostitute and not as the tim burton version what cats sniffed her back to life but perhaps the adam hughes design with the goggles thats very realistic i can imagine her in street clothes that are designed just right i also like the idea of them creating villains just for the movies
2012729 theres a great story to be told of the triangle between bruce batman and selena catwoman i love writing her she plays with him like a ball of yarn shes the only one that makes him all rigid when he talks to her
2012730 i would pick the calendar man julian gregory day long halloween and dark victory happen to be my favorite collections hes not an iconic character but he means a lot to me im called the calender man on the coheed and cambria tour bus because im always on time but hes more like a hannibal lector figure
2012731 at one point batman had a therapist hugo strange who was actually a great villain
2012732 when hugo strange found out about batmans identity through analysis he drugs him and takes over his identity but realistically there are limits to what villains can play you cant have killer croc characters like catwoman riddler and hugo strange make sense because theyre counterpoints to batmans psychosis and fears the joker creates chaos two face shows the duality of the batman bruce wayne relationship and how batmans found peace with that duality batman searches for answers and the riddler has questions batman is driven and catwoman is sexual they play well against each other and challenge aspects of what makes a hero
2012733 at one point batman had a therapist hugo strange who was actually a great villain
2012734 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him

2012751 we found that the behavior of the robot affects the social behavior of a child both human human interaction and human robot interaction social behavior with a contingent robot was greater than with a random robot

2012757 why is it that single dads are more marketable than single moms when it comes to dating
2012758 every jihadist i have ever met from gaza to finsbury park has been a fierce ball of misogyny and sexual repression if you havent spoken to these people it is hard to explain just how obsessed with sexual apartheid they are at least two of the london bombers refused to make eye contact with women outside their families image the sheer effort and repression that required
2012759 so far as i can remember there is not one word in the gospels in praise of intelligence
2012760 the position i have always adopted is that much of animal nature is indeed altruistic cooperative and even attended by benevolent subjective emotions but that this follows from rather than contradicts selfishness at the genetic level
2012761 the trouble is that god in this sophisticated physicists sense bears no resemblance to the god of the bible or any other religion
2012762 the so called christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive but in spite of their religion not because of it the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
2012763 the only change i can see is all americans being forced to wear turbins yuck im not racist

2012776 chris mooney does refuting deniers only strengthen and empower them
2012777 but obviously some debunking must occur or else the myths go unchallenged the trick is as much as possible to focus on the truth and not on repeating the lie this is sometimes a difficult principle to live by and so it always bears repeating
2012778 even though they had arbitrarily placed that label on it
2012779 when people find a claim familiar because of prior exposure but do not recall the original context or source of the claim they tend to think that the claim is true
2012780 if someone says i did not harass her i associate the idea of harassment with this person
2012781 even if he is innocent this is what is activated when i hear this persons name again

2012787 ryan was doing great hes is very emotional and when i saw him go down it hurt at first i thought it was just a bump and hell come back soon but unfortunately he has a pretty serious injury that will put him out for a while so im kind of messed up about that
2012788 we have to double up our load now ryan was going to step up and handle the short yardage and goal line packages we couldnt argue on him about that position he is one of those guys that are tougher and have a bigger body hes bigger than selvin young anthony alridge and me it kind of messes up the rotation a little bit but we just have to step up and just do it
2012789 im just sick of hitting against our defense im ready to beat up on somebody else i want to see how our plays work against a different team
2012790 the coaching staff will let us know by 11 a m they will tell us how many quarters or halves we are going to play each
2012791 i can believe it i worked hard and everything i get i deserve i go to work hard everyday the coaches and players see it i see it i just pray that i get a shot once again and make the most of it
2012792 im not worrying about him i worry about the defense maybe our defense should take heed in that i dont really care
2012793 we are trying to get out there and make a name for our defense immediately and when the season comes around to just have a taste in our mouths of getting off to a good start
2012794 we picked it up pretty fast and we are having fun its not as complicated not a lot of rules you give your athletes and players a chance to just play ball we have a lot of talent on defense and we use that talent better
2012795 the only way we are going to prove that is going out on a saturday or sunday and making a name for our defense we have been having good practices here defense is doing well the real test is going to come once we are playing games
2012796 we know of it but it still comes down to playing ball i guess between them its bragging rights but between us we need to make a statement
2012797 its kind of early to say but im sure its going to be a good one
2012798 it gave us a chance to take advantage get off our feet and get ready for houston
2012799 i just came in here with a positive mentality having a good off season strength and conditioning program and just transferring it to the season staying in shape its a long season but you have to keep your body healthy and that is one of my goals

2012821 as companies have transitioned to self service models i fear that declining transparency and a lack of market rules enforcement have damaged the credibility of auctions in the eyes of many suppliers beyond the point of repair perhaps this explains why id argue actual reverse auction usage is down inside many companies despite the widespread availability of tools to all sourcing professionals this is my observation not an empirically based fact mind you

2012826 its really been a while since i had truly enjoyed a meal in a restaurant in buenos aires in a restaurant that breaks with the tradition of what we usually eat here grilled meats breaded steaks and pastas which eventually becomes routine the pisco sour was magnificent although expensive and the flavor of the dishes was very delicious and different as well having a good presentation
2012827 a low key locale but very pleasant the piscos are not only very good but help you relax to enjoy the good food the menu is impeccable there is a varied and well balanced selection of dishes its hard to choose because quality and flavor are present in all the options desserts are worth a special mention my dining companions happily enjoyed their suspiro lime o while i had the tres leches which was truly exquisite the decoration is fine but nothing out of this world i dont recommend it for romantic dinners
2012828 the food tiradito and fried rolls were excellent and this meal allowed us to escape from the routine and try a different cuisine from the traditional type found in buenos aires the service and recommendations were very good the dining area was very comfortable i recommend it

2012841 cern has today announced that the first attempt to circulate a beam in the large hadron collider lhc will be made on 10 september
2012842 the lhc is the worlds most powerful particle accelerator producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine and around 30 times more intense when it reaches design performance probably by 2010
2012843 starting up such a machine is not as simple as flipping a switch
2012844 commissioning is a long process that starts with the cooling down of each of the machines eight sectors
2012845 by the end of july this work was approaching completion with all eight sectors at their operating temperature of 1
2012846 once stable circulating beams have been established they will be brought into collision and the final step will be to commission the lhcs acceleration system to boost the energy to 5 tev taking particle physics research to a new frontier

2012898 only by understanding where i live can i learn how to live
2012899 i live my life in growing orbits which move out over the things of the world
2012900 most of all nature is reflected in our capacity for wonder nasci to be born
2012901 it is a grand long view the river and valley and then coves and blue ridges heaved up and ragged to the limits of eyesight
2012902 a conscientious journal keeper is really the natural historian of his own life
2012903 you could build your own life on the observation of it
2012904 pffffft she cant run for president you gotta be 35 years old and rihanna cant be her running mate cause not only is she not 35 either shes not even a native born american sheesh
2012905 the facts here are simple and straight forward this is a simple case
2012906 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2012907 get the expletive out of here leave my expletive family alone get off my expletive porch
2012908 i dont believe there is a person who has ever been through this process that respects it more than i do
2012909 our criminal justice system is a victim in this case actions of defendant are an assault on the judicial system
2012910 if they want to bring the charges lets go its the only way to get it resolved
2012911 i feel very grown up now yes i am an adult im running a huge corporation and its very exciting
2012912 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead ill see you at the debates bi hes
2012913 he was very strange and he wasnt just talking about sex with girls
2012914 im not intimidated walking downtown but this guy gave my friend and me the creeps
2012915 he told us that he has had sex with boys and girls he was just so strange that we wanted to get away from him but he followed us into buddakhan and he sat next to us
2012916 we were fairly busy but i knew something was going on because two ladies wanted me to let them out of the back door so right away i know something wasnt right
2012917 dan was going to get the keys to let us out the back door
2012918 but he thought that was going too far the bar was about to close so he told us to sit down at the bar while he cleared the place out we sat away from where witkowski was and he started coming towards us the bartender told him it was time to leave he refused
2012919 then i asked him to leave he refused so i asked him again and he refused again then i became more assertive and thats when he started yelling profanity
2012920 he was screaming things like you fucking homosexual and you are a homosexual faggot while squatting down and grabbing his crotch
2012921 thats when i knew he had to be escorted out
2012922 and somewhere near the entrance of the parking lot next to the pop machine he hit me from behind
2012923 that guy was completely unhinged if we werent out there and hadnt started running towards them i think he wouldve kept kicking him until he was brain dead
2012924 one officer told me i had to file a report and press charges another officer said that the officer at the scene had filed the report and i didnt have to do anything
2012925 we knew who the guy was we had witnesses so following up with the police wasnt the priority making sure i didnt have internal injuries was that weekend my family helped me take care of my wounds keeping my chin clean etc monday was when i started actively trying to get this guy arrested
2012926 i just couldnt figure out why i was being stone walled
2012927 coincidentally the last date for the opera was july 27th and witkowskis court date wasnt until july 28th
2012928 i still dont have the original police report but based on the enquirer report i dont think it was accurate the article said he punched me in the chin and kicked me in the head i believe that the original police report said that and made no mention of me being unconscious or of the life threatening injuries that didnt make any sense because you cant punch somebody in the chin and kick them in the head at the same time
2012929 if the original police report said i was knocked unconscious and kicked a bunch of times then i think the police wouldve more aggressively pursued this if they wrote it up with minor injuries then thats probably why it didnt get much attention they probably just thought it was a bar fight but it wasnt no one called me no one researched it everyone just took the original police report as fact
2012930 when i show people the pictures of the crime scene and tell people exactly what happened with me being knocked on the ground and the kind of attack they get fired up and want to take action theyre shocked and they realize the seriousness of the attack
2012931 if the report in the enquirer wouldve said opera singer knocks restaurant owner unconscious and almost kicks him to death which is what happened he wouldve been arrested the next day and it wouldve been front page news in the enquirer
2012932 if the facts had been portrayed accurately it wouldve been a whole different scenario if someone wouldve knocked out jeff ruby and the same thing wouldve happened to him it wouldve been a huge story
2012933 the things he does best were going to play him hes a gifted guy
2012934 he always had this little mischievous grin on him and a little twinkle in his eyes that always made you wonder what he was up to
2012935 he was a very curious energetic young man he was very athletic and i would say that he was a little more of a risk taker especially on the playground
2012936 he looked like an athlete even at that age he didnt have to do any extra laps for shenanigans
2012937 he stood out as a kid that had a lot of potential
2012938 represented and its the only song on the cd that tries to even show a little up to date emotion we love
2012939 two classic songs that weve loved and listened to for 30 years or something like it
2012940 which is a really pathetic attempt to be funny i suppose i dont have to tell you what them are show your hands america if you find anything this guy does funny um i dont see any hands it just makes me wonder how in the world some people make it
2012941 if you love coffee from the exquisite coffee shops you will love the coffee you get through a cold brew system i finally have mastered the starbucks taste i told my husband yesterday that ill never go back to his acidic coffee aka drip coffee pot made i nearly have panic attacks when i am running low of my filtron coffee yes its that good

2012944 it should be the end users decision what lawful content they want to be able to send and receive and which services applications hardware and software they want to use for such purposes
2012945 i apologize for always talking about sex so much i know it is nothing you are interested in but in any case it would be an appropriate introduction to freud
2012946 if groups of people are allowed to stand around drinking alcohol smoking marijuana and going to the bathroom in broad daylight on public walkways with no fear of being arrested
2012947 we are sending a clear message to criminals that uptown will not put up with it the business community isnt going to put up with it anymore
2012948 maybe if we had a responsible accountable business community on howard street we might get some positive results also
2012949 if we werent doing patrols it wouldnt be as calm as it is

2013014 there are plenty of us who had zero problems figuring these things out so theres no way this is anyones failing other than yours
2013015 if you can read and understand a newpaper then you should be able to read and understand rip why are people pretending this is so weird and difficult is it because oooh its that brain addled hack grant morrison i hope not i hope these people are just generally lacking reading comprehension and not jumping on a bandwagon
2013016 dont use a groupthink argument unless it is in favor of grant morrison
2013017 if a dozen of us got it and one of you didnt the problem has to be with you
2013018 no he said glue i heard glue and so did these 12 other guys

2013031 the only thing i dont understand is why people seem to spend so much energy reading and watching and thinking and talking about stuff they hate
2013032 here is a form of argument that i think is bad
2013033 mmmmmnah we dont wanna talk about that now heres an argument thatd bad
2013034 if you understood something like i understand it youd agree with me
2013035 you only like something i dont like because of groupthink
2013036 calling people intellectually inferior for not getting morrison or liking morrison is childish dismissing morrison as too obtuse is understandable hes not everyones thing and the idea that one must like morrisn to have good taste in comics is insulting i say this as a fan of morrison who doesnt always get or like his work especially the mystery play but reading why others liked it was interesting liking is a matter of personal taste but can we recognize that not getting a grant morrison comic is a legitimate complaint being confused by some of his storytelling choices and references can be frustrating i dont need everything in a story spoonfed to me but reading a comic that confuses me does not make me want to pick up the next issue as i said i like morrisons writing so ill give him the benefit of the doubt but i can understand why others do not

2013047 sienna and he are in love theyre living together in los angeles everyone knows about her and accepts her its just annoying that all this misinformation is out there but balthazar should have announced his separation a lot earlier than he did
2013048 the problem with the previous crises was that like civil war there was too much happening in other comics outside the core title so the whole thing jumped about from title to title with constant condensed catch ups or footnotes to fill you in if you hadnt bought title x or title y
2013049 so its like final crisis is 9 parts instead of 7 more depending on whether morrisons other mini series is important and since the superman mini series is taking the place of final crisis i dont think it is a problem
2013050 i also think that a lot of people like him because its the
2013051 yeah its fair stephen to say that morrison is treading on some familiar ground here but i think the delivery of the comic is what makes it stand out the foreboding nature of the comic is unlike his other superhero work

2013072 the keiretsu forum is an amazing community of established angel investors that come together each month to help raise capital and grow emerging companies
2013073 i would recommend the process to other entrepreneurs as long as they are well prepared when they enter the process
2013074 as the price of crude oil continues to drop drivers nationwide and in texas are beginning to really see the benefits prices have fallen by about a quarter nationwide and by about the same amount in the state this means that a motorist who purchased 15 gallons of gas at 3 99 a gallon can now expect to get 16 gallons for the same total cost all of the great work done by motorists this summer to conserve fuel and consolidate trips appears to be paying off
2013075 hi my name is denise austin most of you wont recognize me so i am making a muscle and standing out in front of the ivy so you will notice me look it worked im in a blog

2013093 rather than charge the fare necessary to produce their product management has chosen to resort to the tactics of ultra low fare carriers such as allegiant airlines and irish carrier ryanair
2013094 this model resorts to a nickel and dime approach to the airlines most valuable asset the passengers flight attendants are trained and certified safety professionals not cashiers to be used in managements futile attempt to bolster us airways bottom line
2013095 selling these items detracts from the focus on safety for both passengers and crew while we understand managements intent to add revenue this program will put both flight attendants and passengers in a no win situation proven by the myriad of problems arising from the buy onboard program currently in place
2013096 in the current industry of customer frustration the last thing flight attendants want to do is add fuel to the fire

2013098 readers were able to observe the piteous wreckage behind the trolls braggadocio
2013099 who could throw all of these resources behind a single investigation

2013101 we shouldnt be spending so much money on rebuiling iraq
2013102 what would be the short term and long term impacts of our two options stay or leave and which is in our countrys better interest
2013103 we cannot walk out until the job is finished doing so would allow iraq to fall into worse conditions than they ever had and also disparage the sacrifice of every soldier and soldiers family who lost a life there
2013104 the meaninglessness of delayed appointments and discretionary grants of capital postconviction counsel
2013105 forcing indigent capital inmates to run the post conviction course alone even for a brief time undermines the very purpose of granting post conviction counsel in the first place

2013156 we have to be very careful that the same thing doesnt happen in the schools who are facing exactly the same economic constraints that families with modest wages and incomes are facing
2013157 it hurts and we dont know exactly why or whats wrong but maybe itll get better with some rest

2013199 so my next question is how do you find the unique you in your art
2013200 our shortfall in sales this quarter was due to our inability to ship approximately 8 million in orders due to unavailable inventory we had strategically reduced inventory levels during our last fiscal year expecting that our suppliers could timely replenish components which they were not able to do this problem was compounded by our strong sales performance in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for certain key products we however expect to recover the sales shortfall over the next quarter
2013201 our sales shortfall is not an indication of the demand for our products and u s department store retail sell through which remains strong and far ahead of last fiscal year despite the difficult retail environment our promotional spending during the first quarter increased sell through of our paris hilton and guess brands which we believe will result in higher orders for the important upcoming holiday season the inventory shortage will not affect the initial orders for jessica simpsons fancy which recently commenced shipping nor for our new paris hilton fragrance fairy dust which will ship in september
2013202 in spite of our first quarter production difficulties it is our expectation that sales for the current quarter and sales and profit for the full fiscal year will significantly exceed those of the prior year comparable periods

2013212 do not extract the actual information in our brains for example our concept of a word
2013213 if the center had been approached by agents or officials of the government acing in an official capacity to gather information on parapsychology research
2013214 if the government were now committed to fisa compliance going forward
2013215 that is it wants to retain the option of departing from fisa again if and when the president sees fit to do so as i wrote above that s perfectly fine and not out of the ordinary even if i disagree with the merits of the government s position
2013216 in which case the government could simply live under the injunction and withdraw its appeal but the government understandably wishes to preserve its future prerogatives to depart from fisa which is why it has not withdrawn its appeal
2013217 the government seeks an order and the fisa court decides whether to grant it
2013218 to require the government to seek and obtain orders from the fisa court finding probable cause that fisa
2013219 except in accordance with fisa is not of course a representation made or ordered by the fisa court

2013231 nasa ames research center is developing a system with two sensors that monitor electrical signals sent to speech muscles and predict what the person is trying to say if this technology advances it will be possible to think about what you are saying and for that to be translated remotely and transferred to the correct recipient
2013232 by the end of this century i dont think there will be a clear distinction between human and machine
2013233 these people are already walking around with chips in their heads
2013234 unlike comparable studies this is the first demonstration to prove that simultaneous recordings from large ensembles of neurons can be converted in real time and online to control an external device extracting signals directly from the brain to control robotic devices has been a science fiction theme that seems destined to become fact
2013235 it was an amazing sight to see the robot in my lab move knowing that it was being driven by signals from a monkey brain at duke
2013236 it was as if the monkey had a 600 mile 950 km long virtual arm
2013237 the electrical brain patterns tells us the monkey is planning to reach
2013238 to get a rich signal that allows you to move a limb in three dimensional space or move a cursor around on a screen will require the ability to record from at least 30 neurons
2013239 the first reported case of electrical stimulation of the human brain

2013242 the cia and military mind control research building the manchurian candidate
2013243 initial biological work on techniques and brain locations essential to providing conditioning and control of animals has been completed the feasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals has been demonstrated the ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide practical systems suitable for human application
2013244 the most interesting aspect of the transdermal stimoceivers is the ability to perform simultaneous recording and stimulation of brain functions thereby permitting the establishment of feedbacks and on demand programs of excitation with the aid of the computer with the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of electronics it may be possible to compress the necessary circuitry for a small computer into a chip that is implantable subcutaneously in this way a new self contained instrument could be devised capable of receiving analyzing and sending back information to the brain establishing artificial links between unrelated cerebral areas functional feedbacks and programs of stimulation contingent on the appearance of pre determined patterns
2013245 looking into the future it may be predicted that telerecording and telestimulation of the brain will be widely used
2013246 among the many telemetry instruments being used today are miniature radio transmitters that can be swallowed carried externally or surgically implanted in man or animal they permit the simultaneous study of behaviour and physiological functioning the scope of observations is too broad to more than hint at a few examples the possibilities are limited only by the imagination of the investigator

2013248 this is the end of death by combining this information with a record of the persons genes we could recreate a person physically emotionally and spiritually
2013249 the brain is so complex that one wouldnt at the outset think that replacing any of its parts is doable
2013250 at least in principle it looks as though a chip imitating some functions of the hippocampus could be implanted in the future
2013251 its a huge huge advance in simply duplicating the functions of the hippocampus which in many ways dr theodore w berger a professor of biomedical engineering at the university of southern california and the director of the center for neural engineering there has done
2013252 within a decade well see these being used regularly to control prosthetic devices or activate a patients own muscles
2013253 the previous eeg based x systems are equivalent to a 1908 wright brothers airplane in regards to speed of learning to achieve control right now with our results were flying around in an f 16 jet

2013255 thats very hard to do if you die after only 70 years
2013256 humanitys ability to alter its own brain function might well shape history as powerfully as the development of metallurgy in the iron age
2013257 theres no question there will be a tremendous number of advances in the future that will include devices whether electrical or mechanical which will enhance the function of our organs

2013269 it is critical that we have a robust and reliable infrastructure capable of supporting our missions
2013270 this is an attempt by the agency to recapitalize its resources for the future
2013271 this is the clearest signal to date that the federal government is taking outsourcing seriously and is following a commercial model
2013272 the federal government really doesnt have any best practices to look to because they havent done anything on this scale before
2013273 you have to deal with employees openly honestly and often
2013274 you have to make it attractive to join the private sector
2013275 a lot of people enter federal service for more than just the job
2013276 for those people you have to show them that they can serve that mission from the private sector
2013277 as a result the nsa enters the 21st century lacking the tools necessary to maintain the status quo much less meet emerging challenges
2013278 hayden has a mandate and he isnt the only guy who recognizes that they need to make changes

2013374 she turned to the literature of these experiments and was surprised at the extent of it she read the fascinating history of brook farm also that of the oneida community in an obvious sense every such experiment had failed that is not one of them endured
2013375 in a spiritual sense they had not failed the mistake was to suppose they might succeed materially that was neither their point nor their meaning
2013376 worth a look it is however recommended by matthew dancona

2013380 these findings demonstrate significant associations between sleep quantity and sleep disturbances and smoking and drinking in chinese adolescents
2013381 although prospective longitudinal studies are warranted these findings suggest a potential role of sleep intervention that is education in sleep hygiene and the treatment of sleep disturbances in the prevention of adolescent substance use
2013382 the first incident occurred off campus on saturday morning when a faculty member and his two small children were forced to escape from their smoke filled home with one family member sustaining injuries and a brief hospitalization according to a statement released by the ucsc chancellor george blumenthal the second incident occurred shortly afterward when the vehicle of another researcher parked on campus was also firebombed and destroyed
2013383 these animals are terrified and abused beyond belief in these experiments and this continued depravity by cruel wanna be scientists simply cannot be justified any longer in a civilized society this is historically what happens whenever revolutionaries begin to take the oppression and suffering of their fellow beings seriously whether human or non human its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
2013384 there has been a national campaign to criminalize all pro animal and pro earth protest for the past few years

2013387 we needed to eliminate various manual interventions such as assigning claims to adjustors
2013388 and our ability to implement sophisticated web based interactions with our business partners agents and policyholders was limited or nonexistent because our legacy systems werent scalable
2013389 eventually we evaluated 15 vendors during 2003 but nothing fit
2013390 around this time claimcenter unlike other systems which incorporated claims into lines of business guidewire treated claims management as a core application that spanned all business lines another key feature was robust rules based claims assignment
2013391 the first phase was property claims which required 26 internal interfaces
2013392 guidewire representatives advocated using the agile methodology which further breaks down projects into sprints incremental development cycles in all we completed 16 sprints during the first phase some of which ran concurrently
2013393 using sprints we could demo something live to our claims department about every 30 days
2013394 this permitted each sprint to build on what we learned from the one before
2013395 also our adjustors can stay focused on settling claims instead of answering inquiry calls
2013396 since anyone with access rights can quickly determine the status of a claim our call center has taken over handling inquiry calls which currently average about 7 000 per month

2013404 for end users the biggest advantage of the uptake of odf is that more and more applications will standardize on this one format and thus applications will be much more interoperable openoffice and koffice are the early adopters here i expect that many more applications will start to generate or consume odf in some form or other for example to export an abstract dataset to a nicely formatted document ready for printing or the web
2013405 to speed up odf recognition qt 4 5 will ship with an odf writer qts text module turns into a one stop document generation api where you can use qtextcursor to create your document via a nice api and you can then export the created qtextdocument to odf ready to be opened by any opendocument implementation naturally exporting to plain text and html are still supported as is printing to pdf support for writing odf in qt sets a trend that we believe in the opendocument format and we think its useful to have for our customers the open source community and all end users out there

2013433 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
2013434 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
2013435 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
2013436 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
2013437 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream
2013438 now we have to look elsewhere for this energy source

2013462 it was not a great surprise to get the invitation as i had previously had supper with mr phillips in jaffa but mr blunt pressed dr howells and the next thing i know i am persona non grata for british diplomats
2013463 i have talked dozens of times to other diplomats and i do not think my presence at an official event should be considered as recognising the settlements as not being illegal
2013464 it is childish behaviour they are giving in to a very left wing view it is quite upsetting
2013465 its a most unfortunate action by the mp mr blunt if the settlers were recommended by the ambassador then that should be good enough it is a case of an mp busy bodying himself
2013466 the governments view on settlements is clear all settlements are illegal under international law reports of recent settlement expansion are at odds with israels roadmap commitments and threaten negotiations on a two state solution
2013467 good morning class today we are going to delve into the mysteries of 2 2 and what the end result of that union of these two numbers equals as you should all know by now the answer is 4 the answer yes fred do you have a question
2013468 miss smith this process is fraudulent and the real problem is you dont care the answer is not 4 you know it and you like it
2013469 now im not quite sure what you are talking about it has been fairly settled that adding the whole number 2 to the whole number 2 equals the whole number 4
2013470 i can show you to example after example of 2 2 equaling 5 you just ignore that
2013471 clue in miss smith weac has created an environment that has caused this activity time after time after time in location after location after location and here we are again

2013489 we want the chinese government to understand the actual cost of their support to the people inside of burma

2013494 twenty years have gone by everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
2013495 we know burma is a very rich country rich with natural resources and the junta uses those resources to prop themselves up for their own benefit not for the benefit of the people of burma
2013496 the american people care deeply about the people of burma and we pray for the day in which the people will be free

2013509 deloitte amp touche llp is pleased that it has been able to resolve the securities class action brought by investors in general motors corporation
2013510 although it has strong defenses to these claims deloitte concluded that it was in the best interests of the firm and its clients to settle this matter now rather than face the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2013511 we believe that a portion of our settlement costs are covered by insurance

2013527 has been really helpful pulling her aside and giving her lots of attention the only thing i questioned was she made all these little adjustments to her stance and the early part of her swing which are different than what she has been taught over the last six years she wanted her to open her hips earlier she had her drop the head of the bat below her hands i guess she was just trying to help her but none of this seemed to work the more she tried to help the worse she got

2013533 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
2013534 the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
2013535 on the other hand there are those of us who would argue that paranoid delusions about the impact on educational policy of a minority faith community who comprise less than 3 of the population of the uk are quite accurately categorisable as islamophobia
2013536 i cant even believe im rooting for a clinton to be back in the white house again

2013539 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2013540 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2013541 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked

2013558 concerns that the new york times and the los angeles times have about the profits of exxonmobil are pathetic when will these organizations wake up to their own failings both news organizations are on the brink of financial failure and yet they do not see any connection between their consistent socialist anti capitalist ideology and their own failure as businesses

2013565 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2013566 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2013567 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone

2013569 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2013570 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world

2013584 no educated person any longer questions the validity of the so called theory of evolution which we now know to be a simple fact

2013586 there are all sorts of things that would be comforting i expect an injection of morphine would be comforting but to say that something is comforting is not to say that its true
2013587 it is almost as if the human brain were specifically designed to misunderstand darwinism and to find it hard to believe
2013588 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown is a form of theological lunacy
2013589 science offers us an explanation of how complexity the difficult arose out of simplicity the easy the hypothesis of god offers no worthwhile explanation for anything for it simply postulates what we are trying to explain

2013599 while what ive seen of their case so far makes a pretty compelling argument that ivins was involved in creating the anthrax
2013600 theyve got nothing that explains how it walked out of ft detrick got into envelopes and got sent to a bunch of media figures and senators
2013601 the strain was grown in 1997 and many people had access to it over that four year period
2013602 having received a sample or obtained it surreptitiously they would be custodians of it too
2013603 if ivins was trying to work harder under the cloud of an impending attack it makes sense to me because i was working harder
2013604 there is that question of bizarre timing after all ivins just so happened to be finishing up his plot to send anthrax and pin it on al qaeda just as al qaeda attacked america

2013610 well i dont believe that climate change is just an issue thats convenient to bring up during a campaign i believe its one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation thats why ive fought successfully in the senate to increase our investment in renewable fuels thats why i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise our fuel standards and i didnt just give a speech about it in front of some environmental audience in california i went to detroit i stood in front of a group of automakers and i told them that when i am president there will be no more excuses we will help them retool their factories but they will have to make cars that use less oil
2013611 one thing i really want to do if i get to be an mp is to sort out the unfair disempowering nuisance laws that actually encourage anti social behaviour it is about time there was root and branch reform one of the issues we get on the doorstep from time to time is very distressed people living a nightmare with neighbours from hell or repeat nuisance
2013612 the few successful prosecutions usually result from years of painstaking evidence collection and then the penalties for the infliction of real suffering on other people are usually derisory
2013613 i believe that by changing these laws and clamping down on all forms of nuisance and anti social behaviour hard we can start to turn around many neighbourhoods
2013614 ian was nothing other than supportive helpful and kind as a fellow candidate the last few times i saw him he complained that he was having trouble with dirty libdem campaigns i would be amazed if he was really guilty of this but if it is true then i presume the stress of a nasty campaign would have got to him
2013615 however the ian oakley i know is a nice guy if he did do this then it must have been because of intense pressure nasty politics and untruths in leaflets can get out of control on all sides which is not constructive in the long term for the people that we serve and is psychologically harmful for those involved more needs to be done eg by the electoral commission to ensure that leaflets and other political messages properly represent the truth and that politicians keep their promises and if they cant there is openness as to why this might go some way to reducing the amount of nasty partisan politics that can lead to this kind of behaviour and upset

2013633 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2013634 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2013635 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2013636 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2013637 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

2013660 combining these predictions with the 5 000 21u rnas that we experimentally identified we suspect that there are more than 12 000 different 21u rna genes in the genome
2013661 there are so many 21u rna genes spread out over such a wide swath of the genome but they all share common requirements for expression and common structural features

2013664 in spite of the psychopaths deficiencies in normal psychological and moral knowledge they develop and then have at their disposal a knowledge of their own something lacked by people with a natural world view they learn to recognize each other in a crowd as early as childhood and they develop an awareness of the existence of other individuals similar to them they also become conscious of being different from the world of those other people surrounding them

2013666 observation of the ponerization processes of various human unions throughout history easily leads to the conclusion that the initial step is a moral warping of the groups ideational contents in analyzing the contamination of a groups ideology we note first of all an infiltration of foreign simplistic and doctrinaire contents thereby depriving it of any healthy support for and trust in the necessity of understanding of human nature

2013711 given the lateness in the congressional session it would be better to review these complex matters in the next congress when they can receive a full and serious examination
2013712 is the immediate termination of all nuclear commerce by nsg member states if india detonates a nuclear explosive device
2013713 would be inconsistent with us law place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical us nonproliferation objectives
2013714 it would also jeopardize congressional support for nuclear cooperation with india this year and in the future
2013715 it shows that congress is concerned that the bush administration may be seeking an exemption for india that would allow nsg trade to continue if india conducts a nuclear test explosion

2013774 radical proposals to close all 13 womens jails in england and wales and replace them with small house units holding up to 20 offenders were today rejected by the government todays announcement is a bitter blow to penal reform groups who had put their trust in key female members of the government my emphasis instead the ministry of justice highlighted initiatives to support women including pilot projects in five jails in which a new search technique is being used which does not require them to remove their underwear
2013775 baroness corston proposed closing womens jails and replacing them with a network of small units located in city centres and run by

2013827 the ad does not link him to the ku klux klan it makes it clear he voted against removal of the statue of nathan bedford forrest

2013836 it has been said that a week is a long time in politics so many things can happen within 20 days

2013845 all voters should be upset with brown if the measure is defeated certainly supporters will be disappointed but opponents also should be concerned that the vote will be tainted because of the attorney generals interference
2013846 prop 8 backers are suing to get the title and summary changed to reflect what was on the petition they deserve to prevail as an individual brown can express his views on any political issue but the attorney generals office should take a neutral position on all ballot measures

2013863 in terms of unit production within the united states lockheed martin outpaces its competitors as the number one military satellite manufacturer in the world over the next 10 years
2013864 this lack of balance in the world military satellite inventory and in military space capabilities as a whole is driving this dynamic market and therefore the militarization of space will continue to be a vigorous and lucrative market
2013865 therefore manufacturers of these systems especially in the united states can look forward to a strong military satellite market over the next decade
2013866 you didnt gain all the weight because of one big thanksgiving dinner and youre not going to put it all back on because of one
2013867 either the market will enforce adult supervision whereby imap technology is standardized or a huge opportunity will open up for web based email readers

2013870 time is running short but i believe strongly that the additional public debates i propose are the best way to make clear where each of us stands on the economy healthcare the environment the war education and other issues of concern to the voters of the 26th
2013871 people relished lopezs story they were affected by his story they appreciated what hes overcome and accomplished and his story really is uniquely american because were a nation founded on the principles that immigrants can succeed here
2013872 there were a few other sports captains in the room who were ready to nominate lopez if the track team didnt
2013873 i didnt hear a word about that in the room
2013874 maybe somebody was in a corner talking about that and i couldnt hear them but i really think people voted for lopez because they appreciated his story
2013875 he is an olympian he is supposed to tell people about the situation that happened there
2013876 im here to inspire the kids who are out there watching
2013877 mccain said he voted against alternative energy bills in the past because they contained a lot of pork its wrong to paint mccain as a flip flopper when hes really just against extra spending
2013878 you say obama changed his position on drilling because so many americans now favor it good it burns me up when politicians are elected and then ignore the will of the people who voted for them
2013879 how can you read obamas mind and know he changed his position on drilling because of how the majority of americans feel
2013880 there is no upside for barack obama to do the factor moveon would get on his case about it
2013881 moveon clearly owns the left wing liberal part front of the democratic party obama is one of the most liberal politicians in washington so he must be in the pocket of the fringe lunatics
2013882 if we dont want moveon org ruling america we had better cast our votes for john mccain
2013883 i find the thought of a private enterprise calling the shots in the democratic party very troubling moveon org is not your everyday lobbyist group
2013884 gee thanks bill i now know the hours ive spent researching both candidates was worthless i should have just called tyra
2013885 americans have a way of deciding for themselves who is fit to lead and who is an over hyped empty suit
2013886 independent voters are not uniformed if they dont vote for obama i am smart enough to know when the carnival barkers are trying to sell me nothing for something
2013887 no amount of obama arrogance will sway independents they are by nature analytical thinkers and will vote for mccain
2013888 once the technology is perfected my wife and i would clone our dogs in a heartbeat a clone is just a twin born at a different time
2013889 at any price cloning dogs is ridiculous my wife and i had two beautiful german shepherds they can never be replicated
2013890 theres not enough demand for cloning pets to happen in the united states at that high price its not ethics holding us back its a flawed business model
2013891 lets clone the caribou in anwr so we can finally drill there
2013892 mankind has no problem tinkering with fertility drugs causing multiple births how is that different from cloning its all messing with gods work
2013893 i have often wondered if fox news doesnt have a laboratory somewhere cloning all those blonde female anchors love your show because you are definitely not a clone
2013894 i adore my dog and will be devastated when she dies but as humans its natural to experience appreciation and loss in cloning we rob ourselves of important life lessons
2013895 thank you for being the voice for those of us who have none bill you are americas true patriot
2013896 i loved your striped blue tie tonight it brings out your dashing eyes
2013897 i love the culture quiz and pinheads amp patriots but my favorite thing is when you use those great three and four syllable words that send me scurrying for a dictionary
2013898 why would any republican vote for this man john mccain
2013899 i was going to submit it myself but you beat me to it
2013900 shifted us more toward information snacking and i would argue toward shorter attention spans
2013901 its a shift away from the drier books we all grew up with
2013902 it is difficult to imagine that an incompetent biography would generate anything like the attention that michaelis study has received
2013903 he did as much to set the style of warners musicals as did its more famous choreographer busby berkeley
2013904 the most difficult part of the whole business is to present a logical story in a ridiculous manner at the same time making it entertaining
2013905 standing strong we have removed the bracing and have completed the walls and the floor
2013906 is to have the roof in place before the first snowfall
2013907 how many people died from injuries incurred playing polo with walt disney
2013908 waned after an accident at the riviera country club on october 28 1935 during a match there between mgm and the disney studio the horse of a thirty one year old contract player at mgm named gordon westcott apparently collided with walts and westcott fell by one account walts horse then toppled onto the young man
2013909 perhaps comes closest to fitting your criteria its a drama about two kids trying to survive in world war ii except we know at the outset that they die
2013910 little more than ciphers their appearance and their actions almost wholly dictated by formulas
2013911 where animation is concerned the problem is that the medium has never been allowed to compete with live action on the playing field that i think matters most the mainstream narrative film
2013912 the kind of movie everyone wanted to make and to see may be slipping into obsolescence the blend of big stars with meaty serious themes lavish production values and unstinting professionalism
2013913 above all to harness the charisma of movie stars to great emotional and dramatic effect
2013914 dolores del rio a comely actress of spanish descent became a frequent dinner dancing and drinking companion of walts rumors of an affair between them circulated throughout hollywood although not a word found its way into the gossip columns
2013915 all of those directors like all good film directors were in some way egomaniacs and all of them suffered some more than others when they couldnt channel their huge egotistical energies into good cartoons but only into bad cartoons and self promotion chuck jones suffered the most i think and so behaved the worst
2013916 where animation is concerned the problem is that the medium has never been allowed to compete with live action on the playing field that i think matters most the mainstream narrative film can animation can tell an absorbing story that isnt a fantasy of some kind or that isnt as quirky as the triplets of belleville or persepolis maybe it go further and say that probably it who knows
2013917 has become a useful meeting ground for people with sharply conflicting interests
2013918 its important to always respect the creator no matter how large or small
2013919 as much as we want to believe that animation is a medium and not a genre maybe everybody outgrows it after a while which isnt to say that animation isnt capable of more than its currently doing but looking at whats out there now its not hard to sympathize with directors who want to try something new
2013920 the president of the division bmw motion hendrik von kuenheim is convinced that we must make a scooter therefore we are working on the project we want to be open to new markets and it is for that reason that we produce the motor of the g450x for kymco and the g650x to the loncin chinese factory
2013921 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2013922 have always said that had casey not declined to endorse mr bill clinton in 1992 he would have been allowed to speak to the convention
2013923 barack obamas campaign credits small donors as the big reason for their big fundraising numbers so how much has obama raised from people who gave at least 1 000 one hundred and twelve million dollars
2013924 thats one third of obamas total haul 112 million thats more than john mccain
2013925 sen john mccain opposes tax increases and sen barack obama favors them
2013926 of going to a gym rather than visiting wounded troops
2013927 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
2013928 cant point to a single instance in which president bush or mccain or karl rove or sean hannity or talk radio or any other major republican has made an issue of obamas race
2013929 as more is learned about barack obamas positions his past and his affiliations it seems that the change candidate has all the same problems with race as those before him
2013930 its only fair to ask do the obamas have a race problem of their own
2013931 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
2013932 the president of the united states never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
2013933 had very high poll ratings 80 percent to 90 percent throughout his first term
2013934 there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president 90 percent of the time
2013935 what this new work shows is that there is a golden mean with p53
2013936 by targeting a decrease in p53 protein specifically in neurons we can extend healthy life span in fruit flies this is an important conceptual shift decreasing the activity of p53 can have positive effects on aging
2013937 we believe that p53 is part of the caloric restriction life span extension pathway
2013938 its not the entire explanation but it appears to play a major role
2013939 i read a writers almanac on the internet every morning and am very grateful to be able to do so

2013959 this wonderful restaurant imho is the best place to close a deal
2013960 the palace hotel in gstaad switzerland is the best skiing resort i
2013961 the best resort for a honeymoon and where we went is the
2013962 one of the best beach resort in the world i recocmend
2013963 just heard about this upcoming tournament there at the jack nicklaus course
2013964 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him
2013965 you know the difference between cannibals and liberals cannibals only eat their enemies
2013966 america is not at war the marines are at war america is at the mall
2013967 have i told you today how grateful i am to have you blogging on my side
2013968 only by understanding where i live can i learn how to live
2013969 i live my life in growing orbits which move out over the things of the world
2013970 most of all nature is reflected in our capacity for wonder nasci to be born
2013971 it is a grand long view the river and valley and then coves and blue ridges heaved up and ragged to the limits of eyesight
2013972 a conscientious journal keeper is really the natural historian of his own life
2013973 you could build your own life on the observation of it
2013974 when youre looking at who to vote for this year be it president or members of congress you really need to think about science when drafting public policy
2013975 well my child would be cured if we only had more stem cell research
2013976 i dont want to anger the religious right so ill just go along with this because i think my constituents think this anyway
2013977 what in gods name are these people doing why does the religious right try to limit scientific advances when they relate to human reproduction ive come to believe that the most extreme and frequently the most influential right wing advocates seek a country that comports with their view of the bible if it was up to them they would not only outlaw abortion altogether but all forms of birth control except the rhythm method and abstinence
2013978 i am going to elect politicians who care about science in public policy and who vote that way
2013979 congress passed a bill that allowed states to give health insurance coverage to fetuses but not the pregnant mother
2013980 the bush administration appointed not just one but two people to direct the office of family planning who are opposed to birth control they would be horrified
2013981 no but i have heard that some people might have sex outside marriage for other reasons
2013982 these children wouldnt exist if embryos were used for stem cell research
2013983 secularists are often wrongly accused of trying to purge religious ideals from public discourse we simply want to deny them public sponsorship
2013984 religion with or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things but for good people to do evil things that takes religion
2013985 during many ages there were witches the bible said so the bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live therefore the church after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for 800 years gathered up its halters thumbscrews and firebrands and set about its holy work in earnest she worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned tortured hanged and burned whole hordes and armies of witches and washed the christian world clean with their foul blood then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches and never had been one does not know whether to laugh or to cry
2013986 hot on the heels of its magnanimous pardoning of galileo the vatican has now moved with even more lightning speed to recognise the truth of darwinism
2013987 nothing will change because this is the old soviet union for the russian sports establishment the desires of a player mean absolutely nothing
2013988 they are the big bosses it is a dictatorship he is a slave
2013989 its complete nonsense arshavin is a professional he has a contract with the club so what kind of strike can there be
2013990 i dont know the details of the negotiations besides its a matter of the private opinion of the player on the matter
2013991 too much cream in my coffee and slices of cheese
2013992 fall on strange festival rare festival push that ball up
2013993 theyve got all that stuff up there you can learn about it then
2013994 you can take the kid out of the city but you cant take the city out of the kid
2013995 one of the reasons that i love to camp is that life is simple when youre out of doors
2013996 as an added bonus hair can be wrung out and used again and the oil can be recovered as well
2013997 she started planning her wedding a year and a half ago and was surprised that venues were booked
2013998 are particularly useful in a sentence that is long and complex
2013999 i think its every girls dream to see how they compare to other women
2014000 its great we get a stylist who chooses our dresses a professional hairdresser and a photographer then we get photographed in beautiful locations i really wanted to take part in this
2014001 our country is recognized for the beauty of its women
2014002 i consider ours one of a very few countries perhaps even the only country where female beauty is in the blood where it is a national resource because of this i feel that beauty contests here are very significant they glorify these national resources
2014003 its not that russian women are more beautiful than other women
2014004 its just that slavic beauty is a universal kind of beauty
2014005 when people think of nuclear energy they get scared they think of chernobyl we want to show that the people working with and promoting nuclear industry are normal and the fact that the industry is filled with lots of beautiful women
2014006 we try to achieve a golden mean between feminism and femininity
2014007 we want a woman to be a good wife and housewife but we also want her to be presentable in public
2014008 the daily yoga will not only help the girls deal with the stress of the contest
2014009 it will also help give the girls the confidence theyll need to talk to the media often a girl can do well in the beauty part of the competition but when it comes to talking to the press or on stage she has trouble expressing her thoughts the yoga helps with that a lot
2014010 because of the small number of men in our country there arent a lot of women who have kids and a full family
2014011 we feel that a woman who has a child but not a husband is no worse than any other woman
2014012 developing family priorities the maternal spirit and female beauty as a national resource
2014013 the contest was important not only for providing people with information about hiv but also for helping the women work through some of their own issues
2014014 these kinds of events give people the power to open up to deal with their self stigmatization and help other people realize that this can happen to anyone that people with hiv are regular people just like them
2014015 ive learned that things are better left private until youre actually planning the wedding its so hard for me because im so open to hold back i could really just go on forever about this stuff
2014016 we can talk about chris until the dogs come home i married chris i had a baby with chris chris will be in my life for the rest of my life
2014017 i dont want to be one of those girl who doesnt stand up for her self
2014018 god is over all things under all things outside all within but not enclosed without but not excluded above but not raised up below but not depressed wholly above presiding wholly without embracing wholly within filling
2014019 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
2014020 i think people are really infatuated kind of with the fact that i came from hawaii
2014021 that seems to be the focus of most questions and the most asked about thing hawaii is such a unique place and such an awesome place and for me to go out there and have success i think people have been really excited about seeing something different it seems like traditionally its about the sec the big 10 and the pac 10 and for me being from hawaii its different people like different sometimes
2014022 if the fans were with me when i talked to our last two targets theyd have agreed leave them and look for the next one
2014023 war is coming but everyone including russia is turning a blind eye russian statements are not helping us

2014025 clean green domestic sustainable biofuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security are a crucial part of americas energy policy
2014026 last year the president proposed and congress passed the most aggressive alternative fuel and vehicle efficiency standards ever considered biofuels presently blended into our fuel supply are one of the only forces applying downward pressure on the price of gasoline
2014027 doe is pleased that the process laid out in statute has been effectively administered and appreciate the diligence of our colleagues at epa in making this determination
2014028 looking toward the future we must have a diverse array of cost competitive technologies and sources to overcome our addiction to oil in a time frame that is consequential and biofuels constitute a prominent but not an exclusive promising pathway
2014029 tbilisi georgias capital takes very aggressive steps against south ossetia this is very sad and very concerning it will obviously lead to russias actions in return it is very sad that the military actions have already touched upon russian peacemakers we cannot leave these events out of our attention
2014030 as repetitive and uninteresting as it may sound the fundamental laws of supply and demand are at work
2014031 excessive speculation on energy trading is the fuel that is driving this runaway train in crude oil prices
2014032 todays allegations of merit gifting in the news journal raise many questions about not only the process of issuing a merit job to a political appointee during a hiring freeze but also about the department of natural resources and environmental controls priorities questions about issuing merit jobs have led to disciplinary action in other states and even to the indictment of former governor fletcher in kentucky four things must be considered when determining the correctness of this action 1 was this position created through the normal state budgetary and personnel approval channels 2 why was an exception made to the current hiring freeze who granted this exception 3 was the position properly advertised 4 will the hiring process be consistent with departmental procedures should it turn out that all proper channels were followed the situation still reeks of cronyism and does nothing to build confidence in state government also in question are the priorities of the minner carney administration dnrec needs more enforcement more air and water quality monitors and more front line employees not another high level administrator people need to see results when it comes to cancer clusters and air pollution they havent seen those results during this administration we must do better delaware needs real change as your next governor i will demonstrate decisive leadership in cleaning out the wasteful administrative positions in our state government using the savings to help the front line state employees who deserve it this will ensure that the government works better and helps delawares families
2014033 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2014034 i guess youre just abnormally normal because everything came back fine were just waiting on one test that doesnt come back for another 24 48 hours electron microscopy
2014035 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2014036 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia

2014041 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2014042 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2014043 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2014044 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2014045 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
2014046 i have supported governor patersons property tax cap proposal since the beginning i welcome mr ranzenhofer to the cause unfortunately career politician ranzenhofer is a perfect example of the reason we need the tax cap during the giambra ranzenhofer administration in erie county we saw reckless irresponsible spending that lead directly to tax increases thats a record we cant afford in albany

2014078 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2014079 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means
2014080 if a new consensus emerges it will easily overturn the iau this is not an issue
2014081 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along
2014082 ive been arguing pluto for eight years so its another occasion where im arguing pluto this one happens to be a little more formal in its construct so i see it as another day of just trying to tell people teach people about what we now know about the solar system
2014083 when you bring a lot of creative talented people together new solutions can arise that might not have arisen from any one individual
2014084 the collaboration the intersection of ideas has its own way of creating new understanding
2014085 this topic provides the perfect opportunity to teach science as a process not a collection of facts
2014086 we also need to stress the importance of incorporating new discoveries to continually improve our understanding of the diverse objects within planetary systems
2014087 no votes will be taken at this conference to put specific objects in or out of the family of planets
2014088 but we will have advocates of the iau definition and proponents of alternative definitions presenting their cases
2014089 theres a lot of emotion still a lot of room for opinion
2014090 but its conferences like this that are hoping to settle the dust and see what remains standing and see if a consensus can emerge
2014091 everyone sings kumbaya at the end with a brand new classification scheme for everything that orbits a star that would be really cool
2014092 if things are so bad then why hasnt the prophet warned us
2014093 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2014094 if all the national squads will lose players if clubs force them to return home we simply will not have an olympic football tournament here in beijing
2014095 we could do beach soccer or a five a side tournament that would be very sad and the world would not understand it
2014096 we cannot have players who have been entered in the football tournament in accordance with all the rules we cant let them go we cant see them return home
2014097 its really sad to see such a decision was handed down putting in danger the entire football tournament
2014098 after the games we will take stock of the olympic football tournament and decide on what measures to take
2014099 in the meantime we have to manage it in the short term and appeal to the clubs not to withdraw players and allow players who are entered in the football tournament to put their dreams into reality
2014100 i would like to appeal to the clubs plead with them to respect this dream please observe an olympic truce for this olympic football tournament

2014108 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
2014109 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

2014119 far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow examples of sexual flexibility dont square with genetic theories of rigid erotic predestination
2014120 to deny choice to make it appear that religionists cannot help it and to argue that any criticism of the religionist lifestyle is as silly as criticism of being left handed or red haired
2014121 and this has been a deliberate strategy by religionist activists they have done a very good job to convince a gullible public that religionist are born that way and cannot change
2014122 prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience

2014134 these dollars which were once used to fund ad messages to broad audiences are being redeployed to the internet in more personal one to one marketing efforts advertisers are rethinking their approach to media marketing and are questioning their media mix

2014203 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all

2014229 consequently the erosion of sales and operating earnings relative to last year was less marked in the third quarter than in the first two quarters of the year furthermore good operating cost management practices and the optimization of production helped offset the impact of competitive pressures and steadily rising energy costs and resin prices

2014286 its of course completely unacceptable not to reject the death sentence for homosexuals to take up this debate now is important not least of consideration to young homosexual muslim who struggle with their own identity
2014287 there have been enough opportunities for the islamic council to enter the homosexuality debate now its time that the state stand up for some values and remove all financial support from the organization till they distance themselves
2014288 i have noticed that the head of the islamic council himself is against the death sentence for homosexuals this shows theyre going in the right direction i hope that the islamic council therefore acts as an instigator for homosexuals standing in islam and towards the european fatwa council
2014289 i can understand that the homosexuality issue is difficult but i dont accept that the islamic council cant reject the death sentence which conflicts with basic human rights

2014310 samak has the blood of hundreds of innocent hmong refugees and people on his hands after he ordered over 1300 hmong refugees to be brutally forced back to laos just a few months ago
2014311 unarmed and innocent hmong women and children students and the young and old hmong people at ban huay nam khao were attacked by elements of the thai third army by direct orders of prime minister samak in his capacity as defense minister these hmong refugees and asylum seekers were engaged in a peaceful protest in opposition to their repatriation back to laos and to seek to reach the united nations and unhcr headquarters in bangkok to seek political asylum
2014312 hundreds of the hmong refugees from ban huay nam khao have now disappeared in thailand after this peaceful protest march and bloody crackdown by prime minister samak and elements of the thai third army in petchabun province thailand and many of the hmong refugees and people violently forced back to laos have been sent to reeducation camps tortured killed or simply disappeared
2014313 president bush should send a strong signal of protest on his visit to thailand and his meeting with prime minister samak
2014314 thousands of hmong people are being starved to death massacred and hunted by the lao military in laos right now samak is the defense minister of thailand and he should not be sending back any hmong people to this terrible one party military junta that is allied with the burmese regime that also continues to kill and oppress its own people
2014315 we urge president bush to work to press prime minister samak to stop the forced and involuntary repatriation of the remaining 6 000 hmong refugees from ban huay nam khao in petchabun province thailand back to the brutal communist regime in laos that the have fled
2014316 we urge president bush to remind prime minister samak about the historic role the hmong people in assisting in the defense of the national security kingdom of thailand the royal kingdom of laos and the united states during the vietnam war
2014317 the hmong refugees in thailand should not be forced or sent back to laos since they are the descendants of those who fought to assist the united states military and clandestine forces including the central intelligence agency cia during the years of the indochina conflict and that long war many american and thai soldiers lives were saved by the hmong people and general vang paos soldiers during the long alliance between the united states and the freedom loving people of laos and thailand during he vietnam war and its aftermath

2014342 low frequency sounds are a signal of power and size so wild carnivores growl and rumble at low frequencies to maintain their territories defend themselves and threaten
2014343 low frequency sound is also important because it travels over long distances so large wide ranging animals like whales and elephants often use it to communicate
2014344 as far down as you can measure they can hear it
2014345 just as for humans there is noise you can deal with and noise you cant and we dont know what that is for the bears our job is to find out what they can tolerate and what we are looking for is not win win but okay okay for both bears and people

2014467 the renewable fuels standard is critical to our nations goals of reducing oil imports addressing environmental challenges and developing the promising next generation of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks
2014468 for months special interest groups seeking to defend the energy status quo have attempted to lay all of the blame for rising food costs at the feet of the ethanol industry
2014469 but the fact of the matter is that virtually every independent study has shown that ethanols impact on food prices is minimal while its impact on lowering gas prices is substantial
2014470 right now ethanol producers are making more ethanol than ever and yet the price of corn has gone down it should be obvious that the argument that ethanol and biofuels causes higher prices has little merit

2014499 i need to learn the language im working on it ive only been over there for a year or two and its a difficult language i know a few words but i need to get a lot more words most of the girls speak english so its fine
2014500 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times

2014515 as a mother whose stepson is currently in harms way as a special forces soldier in afghanistan and as a legislator with a strong record of making veterans issues a top priority i strongly support the idea of using silver crosss facility here in joliet to create a new va hospital

2014522 clean green domestic sustainable biofuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security are a crucial part of americas energy policy
2014523 last year the president proposed and congress passed the most aggressive alternative fuel and vehicle efficiency standards ever considered biofuels presently blended into our fuel supply are one of the only forces applying downward pressure on the price of gasoline
2014524 doe is pleased that the process laid out in statute has been effectively administered and appreciate the diligence of our colleagues at epa in making this determination
2014525 looking toward the future we must have a diverse array of cost competitive technologies and sources to overcome our addiction to oil in a time frame that is consequential and biofuels constitute a prominent but not an exclusive promising pathway
2014526 while many may have been legitimately lost it seems probable that quite a few are either stolen or reported stolen in order to sell them
2014527 there appears to be a healthy market for both buying and renting laser visas on the border
2014528 have affected the livelihoods of many in virginias key agricultural sectors and could lead to job losses
2014529 i am also concerned about the adverse effects the mandate is having on consumers
2014530 it is my hope that by temporarily lifting the ethanol mandate our poultry dairy and livestock producers will benefit from reduced feed prices and will pass those savings on to consumers
2014531 which do not compete with food and feed sources like corn
2014532 unfortunately for the jews jerusalems water reservoir is situated in the mountains and it and the whole pipeline are controlled by the arabs the british would not let them cut the water off until after may 15th but an arab told me they would not even do it then first they would poison it
2014533 that after the explosion upon reaching the british post which separated the jewish section from a small neutral zone set up in the middle of jerusalem he was questioned by the british officers in charge
2014534 the jews informed the british government that 600 iraqi troops were going to cross into palestine from trans jordan by the allenby bridge on a certain date and requested the british to take appropriate action to prevent this passage the troops crossed unmolested i saw several thousand non palestinian arab troops in palestine including many of the famed british trained and equipped arab legionnaires of king abdullah of trans jordan there were also soldiers from syria lebanon iraq
2014535 the arabs in command believe that eventually victory must be theirs it is against all law and nature that this jewish state should exist they promise that if it does become a reality it will never have as neighbors anything but hostile countries which will continue the fight militarily and economically until victory is achieved
2014536 the jews on the other hand believe that in a few more years if a jewish state is formed it will be the only stabilizing factor remaining in the near and middle east the arab world is made up of many disgruntled factions which would have been at each others throats long ago if it had not been for the common war against zionism
2014537 his later years were filled with ill natured debates over his proposals for reforming english spelling and over the more fanciful etymologies in his dictionary
2014538 he was extremely well read mr ed he lived with a judge for a while studying law who had an enormous library for his time and if he fell into the blunder of deriving all languages from the original chaldee he was at least shrewd enough to notice the relationship between greek latin and the teutonic languages before it was generally recognized he was always at great pains to ascertain actual usages and in the course of his journeys from state to state to perfect his copyright on his first spelling book mr ed old no eee webster gave us the famous blue book speller he sold millions of those jesus no eee was a rich man then came along the merriams oh hell im horsing around now sorry he accumulated a large amount of interesting and valuable material especially in the field of pronunciation much of it he used in his dissertations on the english language published at boston in 1789
2014539 as an independent nation our honor requires us to have a system of our own in language as well as government
2014540 but if it were not so webster said the british language was on the decline you know as noah said it
2014541 his style is a mixture of latin and english an intolerable composition of latinity affected smoothness scholastic accuracy and roundness of periods
2014542 she is at too great a distance to be our model and to instruct us in the principles of our own tongue several circumstances render a future separation of the american tongue from the english necessary and unavoidable numerous local causes such as a new country new associations of people new combinations of ideas in arts and sciences and some intercourse with tribes wholly unknown in europe will introduce new words into the american tongue

2014571 no such thing as success when the human cost is so high and the moral failure so obvious
2014572 time especialy when it comes to national media marketing is of the essence we dont have time to mess around and blow our chances at what could be a fantastic opportunity
2014573 i am a big fan of this national media marketing paper it lays out the ground work for exceptional progress and investment in this sector personally im going to invest my own funds in project development
2014574 speaking from a personal viewpoint i believe that the more we can get out of this time period the better
2014575 we can all look forward and predict financial success for all involved but that comes tempered with a bit of risk right now
2014576 i never thought that national media marketing would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way
2014577 i dont want to ruin the parade but somme humility and financial restraint in a sector dominated by national media marketing firms would go a long way
2014578 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
2014579 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
2014580 countries which share a common cultural heritage such as germany and austria great britain and ireland or the benelux countries could share a common commissioner

2014584 as a practical john maszka i think youre absolutely correct
2014585 what is a proportionate reason when it comes to the abortion issue
2014586 its the kind of reason we will be able to explain with a clean heart to the victims of abortion when we meet them face to face in the next life which we most certainly will if were confident that these victims will accept our motives as something more than an alibi then we can proceed
2014587 i know ill get the jitters a little bit when i go out there because this is my first experience
2014588 oven i georgien konflikten var der tidligere et terrorangreb fra pkk den kurdiske opr rsbev gelse i tyrkiet red der ramte en olieledning det vil koste langt over 100 000 t nder olie f r det er p plads igen
2014589 samtidig har vi gennem l ngere tid set kraftigt faldende oliepriser s der er flere ting i spil
2014590 derfor er der altid en stor f lsomhed over for olieprisen p det russiske marked
2014591 p langt sigt har russiske aktier v ret en usandsynlig god forretning men det er klart at der med usikkerheden omkring rusland vil v re nogle bump p vejen det er der ofte i de nye markeder som vi har set i eksempelvis indien og kina
2014592 der er intet der tyder p at rusland ikke ogs p l ngere sigt vil v re en rigtig god forretning for vores kunder

2014594 my desire to leave is still as strong but there is nothing more to do now other than hope for a miracle
2014595 i understand perfectly well that if i dont move on now i probably never will im just hoping that one fine morning the bosses at gazprom will wake up in a good mood and say weve had enough of arshavins whining lets let him go
2014596 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2014597 but after ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join
2014598 tottenham have a decent squad with luka modric dimitar berbatov and other players and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the champions league
2014599 the main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the english premier league and play against the likes of manchester united chelsea and arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years
2014600 if tottenham can sell robbie keane to liverpool for 25m then in my opinion they should pay good money for arshavin
2014601 that is evidence of his participation in the kidnapping of people and other grave crimes

2014720 being in moscow recently i think theyre going to suffer a similar thing as new york in that theyre building too fast and i would hope that in building and wanting to make economic progress that the history of the city is not destroyed
2014721 that is whats happening in all great cities certainly in new york where a lot of historical and beautiful buildings are leveled to put up some you know modern hotel or condominiums and i think its important that people in the great cities do not lose their sense of self do not lose their sense of history and that people remember that the most beautiful things about human beings are their accomplishments what theyre like inside what kind of people they are and not what they own not what kind of car or apartment they have but you know what their accomplishments are
2014722 so of course i cant presume to understand all the changes that are going on in russia im still learning but i do recognize that sometimes from whats happened in my own country is that you have people sometimes very corrupt people moving very quickly in a country thats changing and what often suffers is the common people and also architecture architecture and history and we want to make new changes but we need to have a sense of our own history i think its very important

2014883 deals such as this contribute to an increase in the numbers of aptamers in development without encumbering our internal resources

2014909 this will be the first true all high definition games every venue will be wired for hd and covered in hd
2014910 even the smallest lipstick camera the camera thats embedded in the target at archery that gives you that point of view of the arrow coming directly at the target even that camera is in hd
2014911 i think what gives the olympic games its special cachet is that they happen only once every four years for most of the athletes its their one and only chance for a handful they might have two or three chances but they have to wait four years despite the disappointment tom brady and the patriots are about to go right back at it and eli manning and the giants will have to prove it all over again and the lakers are already making plans for how they can unseat the celtics and there will be another world series coming up as soon as this octobers world series is over with not so in the olympics its once every four years at most for many of these competitors once in a lifetime and many of the events go by in an eye blink so you think of the drama involved in preparing your entire life and then intensely for several years prior to this event and maybe youre in an event that lasts 10 seconds or less or lasts just a few minutes and it is this which will define you for your entire career i think that raises the stakes and raises the drama and its why so many people around the world americans included pay attention to events at the olympics pay close attention
2014912 we learned our lessons after sydney that we probably had too many features and it became more important for us to have our announcers tell more stories we still have 60 or 70 features to get in over 17 days little profiles but now theyre almost uniformly two minutes or less theyre split between the american team and international athletes but weve trained our announcers during the competition to tell you these stories which are really key the average american not only doesnt know the foreign athletes in the olympic sports they dont know the american athletes in the olympic sports so it is important for you to have an understanding for you to have a rooting interest for our announcers to lay that all out and they do a very good job of it now

2014935 what we are suggesting here is that there needs to be some parity between our older and our younger retirees

2014942 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2014943 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2014944 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2014945 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint

2015051 guarding the self against committing adultery and fornication is achieved by avoiding its causes and there can be no doubt that leaving eyes free to gaze and the mixing of men and women at work are some of its major causes
2015052 there are people who support hamas and their use of suicide bombings in israel as a weapon of last resort
2015053 there are people like me who support hamas as freedom fighters but abhor their methods and there are people who dont care at all about the plight of palestinians

2015080 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2015081 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2015082 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2015083 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
2015084 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
2015085 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2015086 the coalition leaders believe that it has become imperative to move for impeachment
2015087 we elected him and now we will support him to defeat this move
2015088 the economic policies pursued by general musharraf during the last 8 years have brought pakistan to the brink of critical economic impasse
2015089 we can have all the walkthroughs we want but to get it to where the speed of our offense operates we have to make the adjustment
2015090 we have to face the challenge and we didnt win today
2015091 hes physical fluid and athletic hes starting to connect the dots the front line is coming along really well i really like the development of our young kids ernest mitchell gives us power and thats an element that we havent had and he has some quicks

2015094 this will be a way for china to show the world what it is capable of
2015095 i think it is going to be the biggest show of its type ever seen

2015097 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just three hours
2015098 some previous ceremonies have been truly extraordinary and i have no doubt that the chinese will match that at least if not take it on to another plane
2015099 but frankly these things go on for too long and it is getting increasingly hard to wow people

2015101 when you get as old as i do it is terrible when a lifelong friend dies so i cant let it give me a heart attack either

2015103 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
2015104 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
2015105 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
2015106 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
2015107 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
2015108 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
2015109 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
2015110 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
2015111 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
2015112 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
2015113 brandons comments in particular contain a degree of unoriginality and stupidity that you only see in the most muttonheaded and imbecilic internet commenters
2015114 in fact ive seen him use at least a dozen variations of the word gay suffice it to say brandon mylenek is a truly stupid stupid idiot
2015115 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
2015116 the sermon was based on what he claimed was a well known fact that there were no atheists in foxholes
2015117 it is a telling fact that the world over the vast majority of children follow the religion of their parents rather than any of the other available religions
2015118 the patient typically finds himself impelled by some deep inner conviction that something is true or right or virtuous a conviction that doesnt seem to owe anything to evidence or reason but which nevertheless he feels as totally compelling and convincing we doctors refer to such a belief as faith

2015128 our ability to continue to adapt our solutions to the diverse needs of the marketplace and help companies stay ahead of threats in a proactive manner remains the strength of our company and our dedicated corelabs researchers
2015129 organizations need to be more aggressive about isolating their most significant risks and prioritizing their efforts around those problems and testing allows you to do this quickly core impact essential provides all organizations with a tool to assist them in effectively managing their vulnerabilities
2015130 as a long time core impact customer were excited to bring essential onboard to augment our implementation of pro and expand our use of proactive security testing to branch offices statewide
2015131 as with many organizations today we have a broad range of it assets distributed across a number of locations and the combination of the two products will allow us to administer tests quickly and easily throughout all our different operations until now weve had to rely on the use of network scanners in many distributed locations but they simply do not provide the same level of specific actionable information that allows us to isolate and address pressing areas of risk that need to be addressed immediately
2015132 we see more than the ancients and yet our eyes might possibly be poorer than the eyes of the ancients the ancients saw less than we but their eyes might have been more discerning than ours i fear that the whole comparison of the ancients and the moderns would lead to this result

2015143 what a good ambassador of new nigeria gene many of this kind stories to come about us all over the world please read on copied from independent of london newspaper website
2015144 i congratulate the home secretary on this decision it is unfortunate that damilola was forced to return to nigeria where he had not lived since childhood but it is a huge relief that he has been allowed to return here
2015145 he has much to offer this country and we were worried that the home office had not taken his past and potential contribution into account
2015146 he has been an absolute star who has given unfailing support
2015147 it seems to me he is the very kind of person we need to keep so it is quite bizarre that we are even thinking about deporting him
2015148 i find the appellants contribution to youth culture in our society as a whole and to his school society in particular has been remarkable he is clearly an outstanding young man he would appear both keen to learn and keen to give
2015149 i have always regarded britain as a just country and believed that as long as you played by the rules you will be treated fairly

2015167 this was kept secret for a long time because they didnt want hundreds of people to come in there looking for the bird and disturbing it
2015168 that video was analyzed almost like one of the crime shows on tv to see if it could be determined without question that it was an ivory bill
2015169 one of the central themes of a museum like this is studying evolution and themes over time

2015172 i never know how much to warn people the smell isnt the worlds best
2015173 people have recognized this is a useful insect for this process
2015174 he has put together a tremendous program here at the museum in terms of salvaging these birds the reason the collection is in this kind of shape is because of all the time and effort dave has put in over the years
2015175 i personally think that the banners look hideous and distasteful when i tried to raise this matter up with someone a long time ago i remember being told off that those posters were being targeted at the heartlanders
2015176 to put banners like the one you sent me when there is no ge general election near in sight thats
2015177 it gets very confusing here cant tell the difference between country state government and ruling party

2015198 were not going to be the only school district facing this situation in the next couple of years if state funding for schools doesnt change
2015199 there are a lot of odds against us but i believe in miracles
2015200 its not a good time to ask voters to raise taxes but is there ever a good time we need a miracle from the state
2015201 i know the state isnt rolling in money but how long can we keep this up
2015202 what do we do next year do we cut a chemistry teacher do we cut a shop teacher who will teach good hands on skills that a student will take to a technical college and use to learn a career and become a good taxpaying citizen are we going to say they dont have that opportunity any more
2015203 most of these teaching positions were cut from the elective areas but there were also english math science and social studies teachers

2015208 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2015209 what weve seen over the last few years is that the convenience sector realized that they can compete with the quality sector by making incremental improvements in the quality of their coffee
2015210 capture some of the specialty market and still maintain a value driven business model
2015211 i dont think mccafe is going to be a threat

2015222 a consumer education consortium concerned with issues related to food nutrition chemicals pharmaceuticals lifestyle the environment and health
2015223 group that describes itself as 400 doctors and scientists who release position statements on science and the environment
2015224 consumer foundation in manhattan that is in part financed by industry
2015225 acsh has a long history of going where the science takes us even when that science is counter to the interest of its funders for instance acsh regularly criticizes industries who are guilty of making unscientific and overstated health claims promoting dangerous natural supplements failing to tell the truth about scientific issues as in the case of industrys failure to defend the safety of genetically modified foods of course we are known for pointing out the dangers of tobacco in all its forms smoking is the 1 public health threat in the world you wouldnt know this from listening to cspi but its not just tobacco acsh regularly criticizes all of those responsible for distorting the truth about important public health issues including those who demonize specific foods as causes of obesity a favorite tactic of cspi
2015226 we encourage reporters and the public to consider sources of bias beyond corporate funding alone for instance from which foundations does cspi gets its money do reporters ask about their project specific funding from left wing foundations whose stated goals are to increase governmental regulation and take away choices from consumers
2015227 cspi is primarily funded by the 900 000 subscribers to its

2015231 roh found himself in the toilet from very early in his tenure
2015232 roh had no support from the people immediately after he took the blue house
2015233 so be it most everybody knows who he is and like i said the laws the law the guy served his time hes out or he should be out they shouldnt be holding him all this time just because they cant find a place for him to live
2015234 i think he needs to be in a permanent place thats my opinion i think going from place to place thats unstable and he can do anything hes gong to be out and nobody knows where at
2015235 for years our canadian forces have been in the unfortunate position of not having an option other than hitching rides with allies in order to move personnel in countries like afghanistan those days are over
2015236 the addition of these resources will provide greater safety and security to our troops in afghanistan with uavs acting as the eyes in the skies for commanders
2015237 the helicopters will allow commanders the flexibility to reduce ground based re supply convoys and more easily reach remote locations in challenging environments where they could be at risk of ambushes land mines and improvised explosive devices
2015238 to decide whether this was an innocent mistake singaporeans must know the answers to these questions in the interests of transparency and accountability that mr low upholds he must share with singaporeans the answers that he received from mr gomez
2015239 this would have undermined public confidence in the integrity of our elections system and done serious damage to the reputation of singapore
2015240 low cannot brush aside this episode and say just move on this is a serious matter it cannot rest here

2015282 what do we have to do to fight them off today
2015283 this is a very sobering video places like lakeland toronto and brownsville are no revivals such as the bible describes watch this video and let us cry out to our god for mercy that he would show such a revival to us in our personal lives and in our churches
2015284 the value of money is not in its possession but in the value it adds to another life

2015294 a specially created website had attracted only 877 pledges when its deadline passed on thursday far short of the 4 678 people needed
2015295 what have been christianitys fruits more or less in all places pride and indolence in the clergy ignorance and servility in the laity in both superstition bigotry and persecution
2015296 i am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world
2015297 during many ages there were witches the bible said so the bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live therefore the church after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for 800 years gathered up its halters thumbscrews and firebrands and set about its holy work in earnest she worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned tortured hanged and burned whole hordes and armies of witches and washed the christian world clean with their foul blood then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches and never had been one does not know whether to laugh or to cry
2015298 the inspiration of the bible depends on the ignorance of the person who reads it
2015299 thanks for sharing such lively genuine conversations about the work of real psychiatrists

2015306 winning combination of likeable mildly argumentative and almost always interesting personalities often laugh out loud funny
2015307 this is not your usual national day song that is it does not espouse our foundation myth ad nauseam this song was written to reflect our true feelings towards our nation
2015308 i think most people and kids dont dig the songs because the songs sound fake
2015309 its not because its not hip or funky or contemporary enough though the people in charge think so for me a good song is real and felt and meant not manufactured a lot of national day songs regardless of whether they were or not sound manufactured
2015310 a unique blend of metal hard rock and alternative that is often confrontational and politically incorrect
2015311 we wanted to write something that shows our concern about our country and the reality that bites and usually ignored our own brand of patriotism
2015312 this reflection should be done not only by those at the top but by the citizens as well
2015313 the song is about reflecting on the values that have been drilled into us since young while they have undoubtedly helped us reach where we are today it may perhaps be time to consider what we have sidelined along the way and how we can bring that back to become truly well rounded citizens
2015314 whether you agree with us or not its fine the most important thing is that you are not spoonfed to think with a certain mindset
2015315 we do not engage in politics although some of us are greatly disturbed by the politics in this nation
2015316 and by some of the things that this government has done
2015317 i dont mean the usual racial harmony and what not that the govt throws at us just take a look around those non commercialised non touristy nooks crannies and back alleys of that you definitely cannot find overseas
2015318 as dumb peasants who are always asking for handouts and are always on the brink of riot and revolt with no constructive views whatsoever
2015319 people who complain but dont do anything about it people who are afraid to stand up or even talk people who dont want to help one another people who are unfriendly
2015320 if one day magically it was like hey tomorrow there will be freedom of speech its not going to change anything because the people havent changed we havent changed the change has to start with us
2015321 whether or not we want to is another thing but first we have to start asking the questions and i think were just getting to that now
2015322 we must start taking ownership of the future of our country so that we can protect and preserve the things that make our home
2015323 hopefully we can find the courage that our forefathers had in making this country
2015324 to stop accepting to wake up to be able to take a stand thats something we need to learn how to do to decide hey i dont agree with this f band or maybe hey i do either way its a good thing
2015325 you are the leader of our country a leader must be seen and be heard a leader must lead by example please be a leader
2015326 i hope everyone ponder hard enough and understand why the term country was artificially created
2015327 they always start with wrestling that leads to hardcore sex
2015328 higher education gets a severe beating in these magazines i e new criterion and the atlantic monthly both from above and below the upper tier is infected with what is best described as a terminal case of theory the lower tier is driven by a combination of fiscal opportunism and na ve optimism which conspire to insist that everyone has what it takes to get a college degree

2015332 personal qualities such as courage strength and faith or indeed cruelty prejudice and apathy do not belong only to the past in every age people do bad things for what they believe are good reasons in every age some are prepared to die for a cause some are prepared to compromise their ideals and some stay silent every age has its weak its fearful its cowed and broken every age has its heroes and its survivors
2015333 resolution of the retreat of the clergy southern deanery of the diocese of chicago and mid america of the russian orthodox church abroad
2015334 we wish to voice our agreement with the recent resolution of the northern deaneries of our diocese and would add that in addition to giving priority to the education and preparation of our clergy and the encouragement of religious vocations among the youth of our church we would also ask that the broader issue of the religious education of the youth and laity in general be given renewed focus and attention and also that our bishops address our flock with instruction on moral and social issues which increasingly confront us as we see a general assault on the institution of the family and the spiritual and moral decline of the culture in which we live we need the apostolic instruction of our shepherds to guide us as we struggle to preserve and strengthen the spiritual lives of our families and parishes
2015335 i feel that the church must go out into the people more as bishop theophan the recluse said
2015336 replication will not begin until the configuration is picked up by the members of the replication group the amount of time this takes depends on active directory domain services replication latency as well as the polling interval
2015337 can analyse as little as a billionth of a gram of material
2015338 this technique can pick up small amounts of drugs like cocaine or thc the active ingredient from marijuana as well as compounds from explosives
2015339 either that person smoked weed or they sat next to someone shook hands with someone or bumped into someone who smokes weed snorts cocaine works in a mining quarry etc
2015340 the bad guys this isnt a tv show you know everyone is bad to some degree or another no one is perfect all the time

2015342 yes and what happes when i smoke a lot of weed and it gets all over my
2015343 wait they need a mass spectrometer this is going to take some time to happen
2015344 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2015345 we show here that your horribly disfigured stumps have traces of
2015346 did you really think that we want those laws to be observed
2015347 we want them broken youd better get it straight that its not a bunch of boy scouts youre up against then youll know that this is not the age for beautiful gestures were after power and we mean it you fellows were pikers but we know the real trick and youd better get wise to it theres no way to rule innocent men the only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals well when there arent enough criminals one makes them one declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws who wants a nation of law abiding citizens whats there in that for anyone but just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted and you create a nation of law breakers and then you cash in on guilt now thats the system mr rearden thats the game and once you understand it youll be much easier to deal with
2015348 man every man is an end in himself not the means to the ends of others he must exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself the pursuit of his own rational self interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life
2015349 give us your fingerprints please were doing um a a random yes a random drug test

2015353 nine long and medium range missiles including an upgraded shahab 3 intermediate range ballistic missile capable of reaching israel
2015354 crane is bigger stronger and faster than ryan he throws a great ball the only thing he doesnt have is experience
2015355 hes levelheaded and hes confident i think hes going to do just fine
2015356 we were left with no running backs josh is going to be a special kid for us he did a great job in the spring and hes going to bring a dimension that hasnt been seen around bc in awhile
2015357 hes a mastermind on offense but he has a way of putting things to the players thats easy to grasp you just love playing for him
2015358 were gonna lean on our defense early this year until our offense can catch up our defense is good weve got a real strong run defense in particular
2015359 we have a close knit group of fifth year seniors i dont think we have a guy as vocal as matt was i think we have a lot of guys who lead by example
2015360 our goal is to still go ahead and win the acc championship were got a lot of guys who played in that championship game last year they call it a football team for a reason therere 11 guys out there
2015361 for instance in our country theres a shortage of nurses and in their country theres an excess of nurses
2015362 they can be immense changes live university exchanges or exchanges in clubs like the rotary
2015363 i think she actually could see herself in the white house
2015364 no not as president but first lady shed love nothing more
2015365 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
2015366 without michelle he wouldnt be there michelle obama youre one hot mama
2015367 michelle is one of the smartest people i know she is my chief counsel and advisor i would never make big decisions without asking her opinion certainly about my career and my life
2015368 that competition will continue through august where you really find out about quarterbacks is in the game well probably have to play the first few games with more than one
2015369 what hes really learning now and its a sign of maturity is that talent alone is not enough hes worked extremely hard and seems ready to have a good season
2015370 obviously its not going to be easy replacing chris but i think we have enough young talent that can step up and help this team win some games
2015371 since 2000 usc has been in a league of its own as far as college football is concerned theyre the most talented college football team that ive seen since the florida state teams of the early and mid 90s
2015372 i want my husband beside me now to see his children
2015373 i signed at that moment all i could think about was getting to a hospital
2015374 now he cant be with me and the children and we cannot go to him
2015375 it is difficult to describe the joy because it is mixed with a bit of sorrow i would have liked to have been with her i havent seen her for more than a month
2015376 i married issam four years ago he is originally from gaza but when we met he had been living in the west bank for more than 10 years
2015377 the gaza strip is a graveyard anyone who wants to die should go live in gaza
2015378 the israeli authorities should show consideration for our humanitarian case
2015379 i wont agree to my children knowing their father only through photographs and the internet
2015380 its a miserable place you cant raise children there today but i dont want my children to grow up without their father or to leave me when they go to live with their father that is every mothers nightmare
2015381 this is her first pregnancy and she was nervous before entering the operating theater
2015382 she is alone here in a strange country undergoing her first pregnancy which was by artificial insemination that is not easy
2015383 they understood that at the hospital and my wife received devoted and pleasant treatment
2015384 i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store
2015385 we pass those prices on dollar for dollar to our customers we dont earn any profit
2015386 what we can do is arm our customers with the information that they need to make things a little bit easier on the family budget
2015387 at some point in the middle of the night we found him unconscious
2015388 we became alarmed a couple days ago because he wasnt sweating like he was supposed to
2015389 have done a lot of training work in the morning and its hot in the morning
2015390 hes extremely depressed medically hes cleared theres a doctor checking on him every hour he wants to go home
2015391 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2015392 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2015393 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2015394 a lot of people on the team are really good
2015395 but there are already green groups in this town and i dont want to step on their toes
2015396 but no one in this town cares about the environment anyway
2015397 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it
2015398 if all four of those groups had fully funded education nclb might have worked but without the funding it was set up only for failure
2015399 i hope someone there asks him why half his schools dont make
2015400 if were really serious about producing world class students for the 21st century we need a better system of accountability resources that consistently meet the needs of schools and students and a transparent system of data reporting to make sure we can understand how minnesota schools are really doing
2015401 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2015402 i am the first to admit a queasy cynicism at the idea of the normalizing of gay culture which marriage in general represents to many
2015403 but even though i do not see marriage per se as a defining life pattern for myself i have come to recognize that it nonetheless embodies an acknowledgment of our fundamental equality and civil rights as gay people in a way that no other legal or social institution could possibly offer marriage is a fundamental social cornerstone that even the religious right cannot deny the very fact that they hate the idea of gay marriage so much indicates its power as an institution to challenge the status quo and change minds even our own about ourselves
2015404 in other states where the state constitution has been changed to define marriage as man woman only all other protections of gay people be they simple same sex partner health benefits or even full on domestic partnerships have fallen or been irrevocably weakened
2015405 the long term commitment a list gay oriented porn companies have made in promoting hot hunky steamy sex errific safer sex
2015406 generally porn companies are relegated to the back tables at auctions and fund raisers within the gay community due to the controversial nature of their product content yet nothing has established the idea that aggressive horny satisfaction can be achieved safely than the continuing output of the major gay porn companies i have always believed that adult projects and efforts deserve to be acknowledged as publicly as possible both for their artistry and their message
2015407 shawn and his team at the faultline have always been at the forefront of giving back to the community
2015408 we are proud to be a part of such a worthwhile event marriage equality is a civil rights issue and one we wholeheartedly support in fact our general counsel gill sperlein will marry his partner carlos in october so this has very personal meaning for us all
2015409 whether you feel that gay marriage is for you or not we are at a crossroads in this country with regard to civil rights that will affect the lives of all gay people all over the world
2015410 i believe it is of the utmost importance that legal equal gay marriage stands in california and i believe that the future health and well being of gay people the world over may in fact involve our re envisioning of ourselves as equal participants in society at every level
2015411 if someone tells us they want to hear from us by only one channel well honor that but theres so much crossover
2015412 we dont want to make the mistake of pigeonholing people into one channel
2015413 its all part of the mix to increase the relationship and get prospects
2015414 thats when people notice our work providing things like water and sanitation services and rebuilding to critical areas
2015415 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2015416 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
2015417 we cook the great food and serve the great wine mayor villagairosa eats the great food and drinks the great wine
2015418 when businesses seek out self report and rectify illegal conduct and otherwise cooperate with commission staff large expenditures of government and shareholder resources can be avoided
2015419 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

2015426 previous findings show that children and adolescents with autism may have difficulty reading mental states from facial expressions but our results suggest that this is not due to an inability to interpret information from the eyes
2015427 surprisingly autistic children seemed particularly reliant on the eyes and also the mouth when making mentalistic inferences
2015428 the conclusions of previous research are largely based on methods that present static photographs to participants our study indicates that a more accurate measure of the abilities of those with autism can be obtained through the use of sophisticated digital imaging techniques with animated facial expressions

2015463 have agreed that while informal contacts between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran as part of our dual track strategy
2015464 we are dealing with it through other channels measures have already been taken and we will follow them up if necessary and if appropriate
2015465 iran has a way out if they ever wish but we will seriously pursue sanctions if they dont
2015466 you have to hope that there are reasonable people in iran who see this as not the way to run a country
2015467 they should have felt like time is running out quite a long time ago

2015469 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2015470 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2015471 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2015472 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm

2015475 david soft as haye doesnt have the right to call anybody out he cant take a cruiserweight punch and he definitely will not be able to withstand the punishment that i will give him
2015476 we re responsible for keeping everyone inside the hospital from getting contaminated

2015489 this is much colder than other presumed mantle plumes such as hawaii
2015490 if it doesnt have clear source as it rises eventually the plume will die out
2015491 regardless of the ultimate origin of the plume the volcanic hazard remains about the same
2015492 the evidence is pretty convincing that the models give a good simulation of climate
2015493 he concedes that the report did not examine predictions of future climate change
2015494 its only the department of defense that is big enough and has the federal mandate for the necessary scope of development
2015495 every time the price of oil goes up 10 a barrel it costs the department of defense 1 3 billion a year

2015517 she would come home from school and would immediately take off her braces and crawl around on the floor
2015518 its a pretty unusual wish and i dont think weve had others like it in illinois
2015519 she could have chosen to go to a hannah montana concert or take a trip to disney or something and she would have been happy for a night or one week
2015520 this is something that was going to benefit her forever
2015521 shes made great gains and shes one of those kids who really wanted to stay and do more
2015522 when i started i did not think i could take 100 steps
2015523 she can go on the swing climb up the ladder slide down the slide everything we do

2015533 british columbia will not be able to achieve its long term 2050 goals by adding mitigation and adaptation measures to an essentially unsustainable underlying development path instead we need to change direction
2015534 paying attention to the underlying development path offers the potential for the kinds of transformative changes in emission causing activities that will be required to achieve climate change goals
2015535 unfortunately far too often development patterns result in urban sprawl that creates an unnecessary increase in transportation related greenhouse gas emissions
2015536 take steps to ensure that federal and provincial infrastructure funding for communities is directly tied to demonstrated progress towards achieving complete compact and energy efficient communities
2015537 the greater use of marine and rail transportation and the more efficient operation of b c s major ports also offer the potential for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from goods movement
2015538 a considerable amount of freight moves directly from ocean going vessels to rail and then to destinations across north america however there may also be opportunities to increase the use of rail possibly through the development of an inland container port
2015539 enhance the role of rail in moving freight in b c
2015540 none of this will have any effect on her day to day life
2015541 she stays home all day every day she is agoraphobic and it would be worse for her to go somewhere than not to go anywhere so when we negotiated this when we talked about probation and supervised release and home detention all the different options that did not include jail none of them really have any impact on her day to day existence so theyre not particularly concerning to her what she wanted to avoid was having to forcibly leave her home either for trial or for a jail sentence but the home detention and the probation wont affect her day to day living at all
2015542 us ing an interactive computer service to transmit to the middle district of georgia and elsewhere links to three websites which contained obscene fantasy stories describing in explicit and graphic detail the sexual abuse rape and murder of children and from which websites the obscene stories were downloaded into the middle district of georgia and elsewhere
2015543 it didnt get a finding on the merits that anything was obscene it didnt get any pound of flesh didnt put anybody in jail i dont know that it would particularly scare anybody you know a probationary sentence i dont know how much of a deterrent that would actually be for anybody this case fizzled out once the government saw who karen fletcher was and how it would impact her to actually go to trial or be sentenced to any kind of serious incarceration the blood would be on their hands if they pushed it so to their credit the ausa and jerry mooney and i were able to negotiate something that was reasonable under the circumstances and that let the government save face and that prevented karen fletcher from going to jail
2015544 the max hardcore case at least thus far is a win for the government by comparison they got a determination by a jury on the merits that something was obscene and they can check that off as a determination that they can use in future cases and so forth
2015545 but in terms of karen fletchers case this was just a way for everybody to get rid of this case in such a manner that would cause no further damage to either side and let the government focus on other cases they got this mccoy case in athens georgia that involves written material as well a federal case that involves some of the same kind of stuff this is a guy whos been writing this kind of material for over a decade and kind of challenged the government to come after him and they did they indicted him so to the extent that the government wants to push a case and get a jury determination on the merits that erotic stories are obscene thats probably the case theyre going to do it with and in light of the fact that they have that other one this one fletcher is not particularly important and wasnt important any longer
2015546 written pornography obviously does not depict the actual abuse of children and does not foster the market for such abuse except in the sort of attenuated way that the supreme court has already found unconvincing
2015547 these types of prosecutions are not aimed at people who actually abuse children and do nothing to protect children from such abuse they are simply outdated attempts at enforcing decency by prohibiting certain written words just the sort of thing attempted centuries ago by the banning of fanny hill who by the way is depicted as a minor and not enforcing public decency either but private decency in any case they have no foundation in the law of child pornography
2015548 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the licence we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up

2015562 die aua r ckt mit dem klimarechner die klimasch digenden auswirkungen des flugverkehrs ins bewusstsein ihrer kunden das ist ein schritt in die richtige richtung
2015563 es geht uns nicht darum auf die aua zu schlagen sondern es liegt uns etwas daran der ffentlichkeit ins bewusstsein zu rufen dass die mobilit t eben folgen f r die umwelt hat
2015564 wenn man sich das unrichtige ergebnis ansieht kommt man zum schluss dass das fliegen ohnehin nicht so klimasch dlich ist das entspricht aber nicht den tatsachen
2015565 wenn man schon einen solchen emissionsrechner installiert sollte dieser der realit t entsprechen
2015566 es ist ein genereller trend dass sich fluggesellschaften dem problem der treibhausgasemissionen stellen
2015567 allerdings sollte man dann davon ausgehen dass dies auch den tatsachen entspricht
2015568 diese kritik betrifft allerdings nicht nur die aua die luftfahrtindustrie insgesamt betreibt immer noch massives lobbying um die wahren ausma e ihres beitrags zu den treibhausemissionen zu verschleiern

2015579 they actually convert known carcinogens to non toxic chemicals and studies have shown a correlation between deficient expression of these enzymes and increased risk of developing some cancers
2015580 expression of this enzyme varies dramatically in people due to genetic variation and environmental factors
2015581 green tea catechins somehow increase gene expression of these enzymes which can be an advantage to people with low levels to start with
2015582 this is the first clinical study to show proof that chemicals in green tea can increase detoxification enzymes in humans
2015583 there may be other mechanism in play by which green tea may protect against cancer development but this is a good place to start
2015584 green tea boosts production of detox enzymes rendering cancerous chemicals harmless
2015585 green tea has long been of interest to researchers given studies that have shown populations in which it is often consumed such as the chinese and japanese generally have lower rates of cancer

2015597 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2015598 one night my mother asked me to go out and bring something in from the freezer and i noticed a round shaped object hovering over the field next to our home
2015599 it had a bright yellow orange color and was the size of a basketball
2015600 when we moved from side to side it did too as if it was looking at us
2015601 they got in a perfect formation all were on top of each other and when they got together in one spot they all left it was like someone shot them out of a jet they left so fast
2015602 it was just a little light you couldnt really say what it was it just left you with your mouth open apparently that one bright light was waiting for the other ones and when i came out i interrupted them
2015603 using the size of the home to estimate i guessed the width at 70 to 80 feet and the length at 90 to 100 feet
2015604 although it was no more than 20 to 30 feet above the treetops i never heard a sound
2015605 if my wife had not seen it too i would question whether i actually saw it or dreamed it but it was no dream
2015606 i know enough about how things work and its not something i expect that someone would have built around here
2015607 the lead would hone in on the targets and the other would do intercepts
2015608 i was pretty good at discerning what false targets were the thing that gets me the most is the article in the newspaper is nowhere to be found
2015609 we began to hear a sound that got progressively louder and we turned to see a bright glow
2015610 a round sphere looking object was hovering over the cotton field
2015611 when we arrived next to the newly constructed bellsouth relay tower at glendora there was a large sphere like object hovering adjacent to the tower
2015612 it began to ascend skyward at a slow rate of speed until it reached the top of the tower and at this point it shot away and was gone in a matter of seconds
2015613 we never talked about it much and when i did not many believed the story
2015614 i didnt get really deep with the psychology of it back then its not something i dwelled on but it is one of the most vivid memories of my teenage years
2015615 it was so large and moving so rapidly i fully expected to top a hill and find the woods or pastures ablaze before i got home
2015616 i always thought that if i ever saw something like this i would be terrified but after my long business trip i suppose i was just too tired to be scared
2015617 i know i saw something that was not an aircraft we commonly think of as an aircraft and it was not a meteorite because of the shape size and the manner in which it moved through the sky
2015618 it caught up with the other plane passed it did a big u turn and zoomed back in the direction from which it came
2015619 well joe since you decided to post this story how about you write a story about how sheriffs deputies are pissed because mike lewis is letting jason chance come back to work after all of his comments he made back during the whole davis ruark incident where is that story joe i thought you were supposed to expose all that was corrupt in the city and county didnt mike lewis make the comment that one his deputies would be fired no questions asked grow some joe and post a story about that but you wont because youre all buddy buddy with mike and god forbid you get on his bad side

2015647 so what youre arguing is that jesus was the divine and unique son of god filled with the holy spirit but at the same time a bit of a thicko and dullard cos his father let him down by allowing him to say something that 2000 years later wed think was just stupid and wrong

2015651 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky
2015652 since there is a single link to the ground and everyone on board needs to share that link if there are a lot of users on board loading the system it may not have great performance
2015653 the per flight price may be a little high for the casual business user as well since if you really sign up for every flight you are on it will costs hundreds of dollars per year
2015654 ease of connectivity to the network will also be key as i dont think too many flight attendants will be acting as a geek squad agent

2015768 freespire is returning to debian because we need to build all of our desktop products upon a single code base

2015810 by academic freedom i understand the right to search for truth and to publish and teach what one holds to be true this right implies also a duty one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true it is evident that any restriction on academic freedom acts in such a way as to hamper the dissemination of knowledge among the people and thereby impedes national judgment and action
2015811 well i think its the offenses responsibility to score more runs for our pitching staff

2015825 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2015826 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

2015834 soaring oil prices will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as 79 billion by years end according to an american federal oversight agency but iraq has spent only a minute fraction of that on reconstruction costs which are now largely borne by the united states the unspent windfall which covers surpluses from oil sales since 2005 appears likely to reinforce growing debate about the approximately 48 billion in american taxpayer money devoted to rebuilding iraq since the american led invasion in one comparison the united states has spent 23 2 billion in the critical areas of security oil electricity and water since the 2003 invasion the report said but from 2005 through april 2008 iraq has spent just 3 9 billion on similar services over all the report from the government accountability office estimates iraqi oil revenue from 2005 through the end of this year will amount to at least 156 billion
2015835 no war to create an increasingly wealthy and stable iraqi democracy
2015836 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him

2015866 just heard about this upcoming tournament there at the jack nicklaus course
2015867 its been an honor to be back with my friends
2015868 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2015869 do not have to bear the full costs of research and development for the software
2015870 in recent years certain open source software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our license based software model
2015871 the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsofts own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products
2015872 microsoft released the sharepoint protocol as part of its compliance with the european commissions decision issued on march 24 2004
2015873 the popularization of the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including continuing efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products
2015874 this acquisition will enhance our knowledge base and further solidify altus as the canadian leader in commercial real estate market information
2015875 by extending our service offerings and subscription products we will bring greater value to the marketplace
2015876 we are pleased to be joining the preeminent player in our industry and know our online presence will broaden altus substantial information resources
2015877 we are elated to be part of this successful expanding canadian based company
2015878 the day you arrive is the day you begin to go obscure because there are many unknown people out there who are willing to do twice as much to take your spot its easier to get ahead than it is to stay ahead
2015879 my desire is to provide more information not less more transparency not less
2015880 wed say heres the keys you operate it for 30 years and continue to improve the facility so you can continue to handle the ships that operate there
2015881 we have to create an environment thats better than other ports so the ship owners want to come here
2015882 we would turn our portfolio over to them and say this is the business that we have today you honor these contracts be responsible for renewing them and bring in new business
2015883 and that means people must know what this product is its well known enough that someone knows what it does thinks its cool and that someone else is going to buy it
2015884 come on isnt someone going to look it up who owns it
2015885 prom night photo album real prom stories from the cast
2015886 how do you know if youre any good at that
2015887 by the number of people who strongly agree or strongly disagree with me
2015888 if a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly inaccurate there is somehow a perception that i am being successful
2015889 its pretty disruptive the way our austin facility is designed our new facility is designed much more around being able to isolate the flow of individuals
2015890 as a practical john maszka i think youre absolutely correct krugman lays it out
2015891 the future relationship between materials and technologies in product fundamentalism vol 2
2015892 im put here by my constituents and its to them i owe my allegiance taking the oath to an unelected person is a nonsense
2015893 i want my way and ill thcream and thcream til i get it because im so very important
2015894 there is barely a sector in the uk economy which is performing reasonably well right now there is a degree of political uncertainty and public finances are poor
2015895 so he ran his hands through my hair and said it works
2015896 theres no one out there that id want right now
2015897 while tragic the liberal medias knee jerk reaction has been to try to say this is a hate crime
2015898 man of the year jim david atkisson loves america and knows who to blame for his lifes failures liberals and anyone different he is my personal nominee for big man of the year
2015899 the church jim shot up had been involved with a variety of dangerous liberal activities that included womens and gay rights political refugees and had even founded a local chapter of the american civil liberties union jim may be an illiterate unemployed truck driver with a restraining order from his ex wife but that doesnt mean he was a violent dumbass
2015900 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement
2015901 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2015902 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2015903 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2015904 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2015905 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds
2015906 first i thought it was the top light of a sailboat
2015907 but then when they did not move and disappeared i thought maybe it could be a ufo or something a very strange object
2015908 i was drawn away from conversation looking at it it didnt really cause any alarm but whenever you see anything like that the first thing you do is call the coast guard because it could be an actual distress signal
2015909 they were doing some training with flares thats what people saw
2015910 they wolfmother simply ask all fans to please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has lead to the decisions announced today
2015911 andrew stockdale myles heskett and chris ross will make no public statements at this time except to say that they are each really looking forward to making their new music over the years ahead
2015912 his dream that he talked about was that when he got out of the service he was going to build a cabin next to a fishing stream that was his dream but that s not going to happen now
2015913 the np41 and np61 projectors provide the powerful features required by mobile users while remaining lightweight and cost effective
2015914 their automatic features deliver the technological innovation expected of nec products delivering bright and brilliant images
2015915 you see it was the only workers i could get
2015916 i think it is a bittersweet time for the organization no one wanted brett favres career as a packer to end this way but we are happy with this closure i think this situation has gone on long enough
2015917 did you go down there with the mindset to find out if he was really convinced he needed to play or were you going down there to tell him the time had come for him to get out on a high note
2015918 i want to get that out there thats something coming out and that was disappointing quite honestly i went down and my intent was to be helpful
2015919 on behalf of all new yorkers i want to extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family friends and fellow soldiers of specialist andre darnell mitchell who died with honor in service to our country
2015920 his selfless acts of bravery courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten
2015921 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2015922 chinese forces have for years been battling a low intensity separatist movement among xinjiangs uighurs a turkic muslim people who are culturally and ethnically distinct from chinas han majority
2015923 those in xinjiang pursuing separatism and sabotage are an extremely small number
2015924 they may be uighurs but they cant represent uighurs they are the scum of the uighurs
2015925 it is estimated that this option will cost government about r2 45 billion
2015926 if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective polices that is a conversation i am happy to have
2015927 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist in plain english obama means i hope denying my obviously false and desperate allegation of racism will get me elected
2015928 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some white people to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work in plain english obama means why settle for a little cash i hope to ride white guilt to the white house and beyond
2015929 i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest instead im going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testament to my patriotism
2015930 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china
2015931 we believe we are moving to a point where you will be moving toward a point where you can report in an unfettered way
2015932 spot on christopher brauchli recommendation the games the smog the promises
2015933 kanye also just brought him a new beat called brooklyn
2015934 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2015935 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2015936 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2015937 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2015938 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2015939 the key issue is control of the land from the mean high tide water line inland 800 feet
2015940 gaming commission regulations require that the applicant own or lease the land from the water line to the location of the casino and that the area be controlled by the applicant and an integral part of the project if there is public sand beach between the high water line and the casino it is impossible to comply with that regulation
2015941 rw will likely attempt to get around the control issue by claiming that you dont measure from the waters edge as it presently exists but from the toe of the sea wall which is several hundred feet north of the present high water line
2015942 if they approve the site without changing the regulation the anti gaming groups will probably file suit they will probably sue if they approve under any conditions
2015943 will be the most memorable epoch in the history of america i am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival it ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to god almighty
2015944 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
2015945 i have rights and i can do what i want regardless of what others think and say god included i am my own authority
2015946 ive lived sir a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proofs i see of this truth that god governs in the affairs of men and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probably that an empire can rise without his aid we have been assured sir in the sacred writings that except the lord build the house they labor in vain who built it i firmly believe this and i also believe that without the concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of babel we shall be divided by our little partial local interests our projects will be confounded and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word down to future ages
2015947 let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us
2015948 that which the holy spirit occupies should be treated well and indeed should be treated in an honorable fashion
2015949 we do believe it is very important for all believers to take care of their bodies
2015950 i cant think of the last time we had anything fried we try to be more careful
2015951 your body is less efficient in terms of burning calories
2015952 his small frame carries weight in his stomach so it is noticeable i have to be careful because i dont have room for error
2015953 but dr akin i dont know how to say this ive never seen so many fat preachers in all my life

2015958 mikey i think you have some of my runs and hand over 2 or 3 of those saves while your at it
2015959 what i would like people to feel when they see my art is joy hope happiness and most of all to be able to use simple words to have a discussion about art
2015960 i had the opportunity to personally meet romero where we ended up in a conversation about how to bring his art to people across the country
2015961 i see my work as colorful vibrant and very positive and optimistic about the future
2015962 most insurers have really not dealt with the huge book of business that they transact with agents on a daily basis
2015963 we are taking this approach because we believe it will differentiate us from our competitors and because we have a technology platform that enables us to do it
2015964 we issue a policy to a customer in 10 days and issue endorsements to agents in the same time frame
2015965 we have a 24 hour turnaround for more than 50 percent of our business
2015966 ultra liberalism today translates into a whimpering isolationism in foreign policy a mulish obstructionism in domestic policy and a pusillanimous pussyfooting on the critical issue of law and order
2015967 in the united states today we have more than our share of the nattering nabobs of negativism
2015968 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2015969 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2015970 its the fighters and the coaches responsibility to make sure they are on weight
2015971 plus usa boxing started a residential program to better prepare its boxers and you would have expected that this type of situation would never have happened its embarrassing
2015972 competing in the olympic games has always been one of my dreams and i wish i would have been able to represent my country alongside my teammates
2015973 the u s amateur program in the past 10 or 12 years is totally gone
2015974 oh my friend he would have said this and that

2015981 but the fact that greens is infinitely more coherent and suspenseful is well sort of funny right
2015982 the rec is not convinced that hmrc has correctly estimated the cost of the removal of this concession to these sectors evidence from the affected sectors suggests that the cost could be to the tune of gbp400mn this will have a dramatic impact on the supply of staff to work with some of the most vulnerable in society the removal of the concession will also reduce flexible working opportunities in the financial services sector at a time when it is under great strain
2015983 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
2015984 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2015985 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2015986 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2015987 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2015988 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2015989 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2015990 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2015991 weve always said wed like to settle this through negotiations
2015992 its hard to know what exactly it the proposal is
2015993 i closed my thumb in the copy machine at work yesterday but still went out last night and took home gina from accounting
2015994 why you talk about me on the radio if youve got beef with me lets settle it face to face

2016022 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia it has been made doubly worse as the hiv epidemic is now affecting women at a higher rate than men especially in sub saharan africa we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
2016023 the female condom is the only method that women have to protect themselves it has been embraced in many countries and cultures it works and it is cost effective political leadership and funding are needed now no more excuses
2016024 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more hiv infection rates among women continue to rise young women in sub saharan africa represent 75 of new hiv related cases the female condom would definitely cut the percentage down
2016025 it can be a win win situation for all especially for young women the most vulnerable group

2016033 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c0 2
2016034 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
2016035 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance
2016036 if you cant figure out whats going on in the ecological system then look at the oddball the deviant something that doesnt fit the model

2016048 we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much abu nabaa solicited
2016049 the 2004 opinion is very clear but throwing the regulation into the mix muddies the water the fec could revisit the issue
2016050 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
2016051 the public should trust the system because the procedures in place have withstood the test of time
2016052 you hear of courts from time to time doing stuff but in a limited fashion using the justification the judge used here you could shut down virtually every case in the country
2016053 were working on it hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2016054 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
2016055 we should all walk off of our jobs and refuse to work and refuse to be cogs in the wheels of psychotic consumerism until our troops military contractors and permanent bases are removed from iraq and afghanistan
2016056 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination

2016060 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2016061 are you truly supporting sen obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2016062 im dragging this dinosaur kicking and screaming into the 20th fucking century

2016064 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
2016065 i could use all the adjectives i know amazing incredible fantastic awesome but i dont think any of them do it justice
2016066 it was the best experience of my life thus far to be carrying the flag and see so many other maple leafs in the stands and hearing the voices of all the canadians behind me and then knowing the 30 million plus people back home are so proud of us is such an incredible feeling
2016067 its a huge honour and privilege to be here representing canada in beijing
2016068 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
2016069 its energy from a canadian perspective and energy from a global perspective as well its pretty awesome
2016070 its an extremely powerful experience im just extremely proud to be canadian today
2016071 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2016072 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2016073 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a loss is something i and my colleagues regret very much
2016074 we are deeply disappointed to be announcing these results and apologise for the pain this has caused our shareholders
2016075 were in the middle of a financial markets crisis the industry is in a tight place and as a major participant in the industry we are in a tight place we are not alone in having taken write downs
2016076 i wont do this job for ever but right now you will find me extremely galvanised to do the task at hand
2016077 we reiterate our view that rbs has absolutely no need to sell rbs insurance
2016078 what an absolutely incredibly amazing awesome experience there is no string of adjectives which can possibly do justice in describing just how special the opening ceremony was
2016079 all the diversity beauty community and enthusiasm of the olympic movement all packed into one place and time i waved the maple leaf as high and hard as i could all the way around the olympic birds nest stadium every time our red and white horde passed a group of canadian fans waving a flag of their own a rush of familiarity reminded us all that millions of canadians back home are watching and cheering us on every step of the way
2016080 the diversity of the world olympic stage is a thing of distinct beauty and wonder the multicultural diversity of our own team and country reflected by the broad racial spectrum of athletes representing canada was a true thing of beauty for me members of our mens field hockey team donned their red turbans as a sign of the personal significance of their olympic experience and athletes such as jujie luan who have competed for other countries and now call canada home proudly representing the maple leaf jujie even won china a gold medal in fencing in 1984 and is so well known by the chinese that the olympic volunteers leapt out of their queues for the chance to have a photo with her many of the volunteers recognizing a woman who won before they were born i myself am first generation canuck born from hungarian and dutch immigrants
2016081 the show was an amazing spectacle i hope everyone back home caught it on tv and felt a patriotic chill up their spine at the first site of our red and white

2016085 the thesis of this dissertation is that the city gate of iron age ii was used for multifunctional one
2016086 the iron age ii city gate and its area are the physical locations for the society or the institution that fostered multifaceted civic functional emphasis
2016087 it could be argued that they should attain a higher level of competency in english before they are allowed to successfully defend their dissertation

2016095 i was disappointed not to get my first choice of university to study broadcast journalism and although i was accepted by my second choice i actually began to realise that some of the other courses on offer might open up more opportunities for me
2016096 i saw in the clearing guide that the politics course at the university of hull had places i knew that the course was one of the best in the country and my english teacher had been to the university and told me it was the secret of the north
2016097 i learnt a lot during my time at westminster and made some great contacts i was amazed at how many of the people there are hull graduates there seemed to be more mps from hull than from any other university
2016098 look at the course not just at the university i would also encourage people to cast the net wider and look at courses they may not have initially considered
2016099 considering todays inflation pressures and the rising need families have to better manage their spending it is becoming more important than ever for parents to think about shopping smart and looking for resources to save money
2016100 we all have ideas to share and i expect this challenge will generate even more
2016101 this further enhances our ability to communicate reliably over long distances while using extremely low levels of power this allows for predictable communications even under challenging circumstances something our customers have been asking for
2016102 we were going at 120 miles per hour so we stopped and said we should concentrate on the facilities that were closed down and then after that we should inspect the schools as a whole
2016103 what were trying to do is concentrate on certain facilities in the schools that were actually closed down by the task force we want to get those facilities re inspected and opened before the school year
2016104 most of the work is done there are some minor things that need to be done but were confident that should the suruhanu come and inspect them they should pass with no problems at all
2016105 right now if weather permits we will be able to attack that before the opening of the school year once thats done well have those re inspected right now mother nature needs to be good to us
2016106 apparently if i have an opinion about someone who in my opinion is famous i am jealous

2016128 it was necessary and you take it for the right reasons

2016151 we were surprised by the variety of clay minerals in this region
2016152 but whats interesting is that we find the same ordering of the clay materials everywhere in mawrth vallis its like a layer cake of clays one on top of another all these layers are topped with a frosting of lava and dust we can see the clay layers where an impact crater has carved a hole through the surface or where erosion has exposed them
2016153 but it does suggest the long term and common presence of liquid water and concomitant active chemistry on the red planet in the distant past
2016154 the focus has unfairly been upon china rather than the true evil empire the olympic nation state which from the beginning the all male naked greek games has been political and commercial and since the 1896 revival has traded in on the worst kind of nationalism from fascism to communism to global corporatism to keep its monopoly alive
2016155 the goal of all this central planning and spying is not to celebrate the glories of communism regardless of what chinas governing party calls itself
2016156 it is to create the ultimate consumer cocoon for visa cards adidas sneakers china mobile cell phones mcdonalds happy meals tsingtao beer and ups delivery to name just a few of the official olympic sponsors
2016157 the 2008 beijing olympics will open tainted by a sharp increase in human rights abuses directly linked to chinas preparations for the games
2016158 those abuses reflect both the chinese governments wholesale failure to honor its olympics related human rights promises as well as the negligence of the international olympic committee ioc in ensuring that china fulfills its commitments
2016159 the chinese authorities have broken their promise to improve the countrys human rights situation and betrayed the core values of the olympics

2016198 every statistic shows that children grow up more likely to do well in school stay out of trouble and have a happier life if they have both a male and female role model
2016199 too often we look at these things from the point of view of the adult rather than the child i think that adoption by homosexual couples is unsatisfactory for the child

2016217 the violence was cut down is too much for a 12 or pg 13 is not realistic

2016221 this was a very difficult decision and one that i did not take lightly
2016222 after reviewing all of the evidence and hearing from both prosecutors and defense attorneys i decided the pardon and parole board made a proper recommendation to provide clemency and commute the death sentence
2016223 we felt that the crime did not warrant the death penalty we did not want this man on the street ever period when we asked for clarification we were told that we had all the information that we needed to make a decision were not lawyers and all we knew is what we saw on tv
2016224 when the opportunity came up to try to right the wrong i took it
2016225 this is a life and death matter and a deliberative review process cannot be completed by the scheduled execution date

2016233 probably no medical advice is given as often and with so little rational basis on the pressure for obese people lose weight
2016234 nunca foi comprovado cientificamente que uma dieta produza substancial perda de peso em longo prazo a n o ser em uma min scula quantidade de indiv duos
2016235 it has never been scientifically proven that a diet produce substantial weight loss in the long term unless in a tiny quantity of individuals
2016236 if the diet work or not people who make them is most likely to die sooner than those who keep their weight stable or who gain weight slowly
2016237 for obese people or anyone concerned about their health the best option is probably moderate exercise and eating fruit vegetables without worrying about standards of beauty and weight
2016238 the model that anyone looking for losing weight is based on that obese people eat more and must learn to eat as thin is probably a myth
2016239 we have two arrests one had some involvement in the parcel delivery it was an an independent contractor the other person was the intended person for the parcel
2016240 the organization would use a courier or delivery person a contracted person to deliver parcels they would make arrangements with these people to either deliver the parcels to them or in some circumstances leave them at an address and then the drug trafficker would come back behind it and pick it up
2016241 the law simply does not allow police officers to take this kind of initiative on their own without extremely grave urgent exigent circumstances or the authorization of a judge
2016242 this appeared to be a major drug trafficking activity and violence and the use of a firearm is quite often associated with that
2016243 the specific circumstances was that our team was ompromised the mother in law saw them as they approached the house she gave a yell to whomever else at the time was in the house
2016244 these arrests confirm that trinity tomsic was a random victim of identity theft at the hands of major drug traffickers this crime was compounded by law enforcement when it illegally invaded the calvo home tied up the mayor and his mother in law and killed the family dogs the suggestion that mayor calvos reaction to seeing a swat team in her front yard justified an illegal no knock entry is outrageous
2016245 im an animal lover a pet owner myself and so i can certainly sympathize with that
2016246 theres nothing that can replace those animals that they calvos dearly loved and im sure will hold close in their hearts for the rest of their lives but i think an apology from the police chief and the county sheriff would certainly go a long way towards healing this this community

2016251 the longer inflation fears force the mpc to leave interest rates on hold at 5 the more severe the looming recession will be interest rates will eventually have to fall very far to lift the uk economy out of its current malaise
2016252 once interest rates start to fall i think that they will be cut rapidly perhaps all the way to 3 5 by next summer and perhaps even lower subsequently however this will come too late to prevent an outright recession later this year and a long period of very weak economic activity thereafter
2016253 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels

2016335 posted by drteeth about 14 hours ago come on vm come down my street now
2016336 im still devastated by what happened at leicester and the fact im no longer there
2016337 but i want to get back in the game as soon as possible this is the first time in 30 years ive not had a pre season as a player or as a manager
2016338 but im waiting for someone else to fail arent i
2016339 thats the nature of football management and in the meantime im left to re educate myself
2016340 im looking to exploit as many media opportunities as possible and am taking my a licence qualification
2016341 im going to watch as many games as possible and hopefully the call will come
2016342 you have got two great big sides in league one this season in leicester and leeds
2016343 hopefully he will develop a strong relationship with the chairman and the players should certainly find it easier than in the championship
2016344 leicester are down at the moment but i look at one of the greatest stories in footballing history
2016345 when bill shankly took over at liverpool they were a second division side in the doldrums
2016346 people said he was crazy when he said they were going to win promotion and be champions of europe
2016347 its like a warzone and everyone needs to be pulling together in the trenches and thats what id say to leicester

2016357 urgent report is us beef safe from mad cow disease
2016358 under the plan south korea would only import beef from cows under 30 months old in the first phase it would lift the ban on boneless beef from cows over 30 months in the second phase after the u s toughened feed standards in the third phase it would follow the world organization for animal health recommendations to import beef of all ages including beef with bones when the u s actually implements the feed standards

2016361 the current division we are experiencing in south korea that started with the beef issue is in some ways similar to the situation in the united states before the outbreak of the american civil war
2016362 if anti us beef protesters are really concerned about the health and rights of the public they need to observe whether or not the order of our free market economy is being followed
2016363 the grand national party and the rightist intellectuals argue that the rallies are not much different from the cultural revolution that ruined china
2016364 president lee myung bak has begun his counterattack while expected it has come suddenly like a blitz on june 19 he said he had seen the candlelight and reproached himself on june 24 he revealed his intention to deal sternly with the candlelight protests on june 25 protest participants were rounded up and arrested on june 28 the government formally published its announcement that american beef imports were beginning again

2016366 were supposed to read that as a sign that obamas trip failed and maybe it is a sign of that but whats far more interesting to me is that mccains c in c numbers are dropping faster than obamas why why are they dropping at all well both polls were conducted starting july 31 just after the britney ad hit and ending august 4 time or august 5 cbs i think the problem is the mccain campaigns clownishness i think he looked serious to 8 more people before this clown period than he does now

2016387 the centre for health science is a pioneering undertaking which will help to improve patient care and deliver real economic benefits to the region
2016388 this degree will enable school leavers and mature students with appropriate qualifications to register as dental therapists and dental hygienists and could help to improve access to dental care for people around the rural areas of scotland therapists can perform many of the more routine treatments freeing up dentists to concentrate on complex cases and enabling them to see more patients

2016390 i tell you which one i would want i want the mass effect one
2016391 right now in google gadgets you can open arbitrary php scripts you could create a gadget that very discreetly took advantage of vulnerabilities in a users web browser
2016392 one of the things that really characterizes web 2 0 is the high interactivity between the user and other users as well as the application in sharing information
2016393 these little microapplications like google gadgets are ideal for that on the other hand if someone creates a gadget that is designed to trick the user thats easy to do
2016394 right now in google gadgets you can open arbitrary php scripts
2016395 you could create a gadget that very discreetly took advantage of vulnerabilities in a users web browser
2016396 if you can get a user to visit a page an attacker controls and youre logged in we can silently add a gadget to your igoogle page
2016397 we believe it will be applicable to a much broader market that goes beyond the video surveillance market
2016398 server and consolidation to markets that havent been able to benefit
2016399 eliminating a server that would otherwise be added to the rack
2016400 serverless computing represents a new class of emerging technology where i o and compute resources are closely coupled together to serve the needs of i o intensive workloads with less complexity easier management and higher availability than distributed solutions
2016401 by layering server virtualization on top of their high performance highly available x86 based storage controllers pivot3 allows organizations to harness huge quantities of i o without complex fabrics or complex management
2016402 the drop was largely due to due to increased competition and promotional activities for the olympic games we expect the margin to remain stable at this level in the current year
2016403 the olympics will have some negative impact on the pc sales not necessarily less than the earthquake since it will last a few weeks and will affect main cities such as beijing
2016404 even if the margin on the netbook is very low lenovo must do it otherwise it will lose market share
2016405 we escaped through a crack in the door we started crawling thats where my race started
2016406 i want to run as fast as that guy and i want to run for that country
2016407 i went out to my tent to think about it
2016408 in the camp we had chicken twice a year on christmas and easter
2016409 one chicken shared by ten kids we cut the little pieces of chicken we put a big load of water and we boiled it and put a lot of salt and we just shared the soup of the water if you get a little piece of chicken merry christmas to you
2016410 i dont even have a word for it im so happy
2016411 if he hadnt switched sports the aliens wouldve stolen his talent we wouldve lost that intergalactic game and the aliens would be raping our wives and daughters as we speak
2016412 i dont usually digg top ten lists but this one was good
2016413 like i took this class evolutionary biology as part of my electives and the professor was all like we came from monkeys and not like read the account in genesis for the truth its crazy
2016414 now those six games would make an excellent holiday line up
2016415 yeah they disney offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself no regrets no regrets at all
2016416 yet california democrats placed their radical political agenda ahead of citizens safety by refusing to prevent terrorists from teaching in our schools citizens should be outraged that these lawmakers are playing political games with our safety
2016417 would have required any person or organization seeking use of public school property to sign a statement of information declaring they do not advocate the overthrow of our government and are not part of an extremist terror network also any school employee discovered to be part of an extremist terror network could be fired
2016418 will allow communists to teach in public schools and use government property for their meetings
2016419 it really is shocking that at a time when america is still subject to attacks from radical terrorists and communist governments still terrorize their citizens california democrats wont stand up for us we have brave soldiers putting their lives on the line every day to defend us from such tyranny but democrats will not cast a simple vote to do the same here in california democrats are quick to side with the latest political cause championing the rights of the oppressed with their votes today democrats have missed their opportunity to make a statement denouncing oppressive communist governments responsible for the misery and suffering of so many worldwide
2016420 i am appalled that democrat lawmakers will not agree to these commonsense amendments
2016421 my son is currently serving in iraq to defend our state and nation from terrorists yet democrats will not do their part on the homefront to also defend us from such extremists
2016422 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2016423 i knew the time was right and i felt i was the right person to do it
2016424 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2016425 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know steve cohens complete record
2016426 international court rulings have no bearing on criminal cases in the u s
2016427 soc functionality might have future applications that could potentially be advantageous to consumers such as facilitating new business models
2016428 consider waivers petitions or other proposals for the use of soc in this regard
2016429 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2016430 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2016431 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2016432 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons
2016433 trixie made us go on at least 4 times i was laughing so hard i was crying as we kept making circles trying to figure out what the heck she was trying to have us do
2016434 are you kidding me are you kidding me go go
2016435 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
2016436 i cant deny it was an important issue there are very few players who left me against my will
2016437 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2016438 he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2016439 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2016440 were happy he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed he is a manchester united player
2016441 the player is happy to be a manchester united player he has always been happy to be here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him
2016442 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont ever want to leave
2016443 the three greatest fools in history have been jesus christ don quixote and me
2016444 moreover the latest multi core systems are capable of simultaneous execution of highly complex workloads each commanding its own virtual memory space in that scenario the only way of avoiding data collision without writing back to the hard disk is the migration towards super high memory densities

2016448 while material exposure to dreadful u s residential construction and auto markets a concern we believe current valuation metrics more than amply discount risks
2016449 her son in law overdosed not good thats why shes had to cut back on her hours
2016450 its working out better for her schedule she was here at the restaurant too many hours she was working herself nearly to death its so sad that a tragedy has forced her to slow down a bit

2016452 hes out wont be back for several days his wife is having major surgery this morning doesnt look good as far i can tell we gotta pray for the two of them theyre really swell folk
2016453 i feel so sorry for them they thought that her condition was improving after her last surgery but the whole thing flared up again and now shes right back in the operating room
2016454 yes we do and we are all remembering that especially today
2016455 how are you doing youve had a busy day pre op this morning surgery this afternoon and now the day is nearly over
2016456 i am doing so well my daughter cannot get over it she said that when she drove here to check on me after surgery she was quite apprehensive after the other operations ive had but this time i am so thankful for the wayive come through this i even enjoyed my evening meal
2016457 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2016458 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2016459 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2016460 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2016461 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2016462 the caucasus teetered on the brink of all out war today as russia sent tanks and fighter jets into the breakaway region of south ossetia to support it against an invasion by georgia
2016463 i have just chosen to take the reins of my career
2016464 my mom and i have a different view and mindset
2016465 it is a completely new day and time in music now in four years his audience demographic and musical direction has changed records like lollipop are the type of phenomena that yeah was in 2004
2016466 i had a great time and we parted ways amicably
2016467 it was the best experience of my life thus far
2016468 as we were coming through the tunnel we were singing o canada a couple times
2016469 its energy from a canadian perspective and energy from a global perspective as well its pretty awesome
2016470 its just so unbelievable right now its my first olympics and ive waited so long for this its incredible
2016471 way to go grace i like the way you knocked that entire rack of funyons over when you tried to be sly about grabbing one in the first place
2016472 formed an outside corporation with it and cut off all other organizations
2016473 dronke of the new must of lewd lightness of minde and vayne gladness of harte
2016474 had the power to exert pressure on individuals to stretch their inventive capacity
2016475 hackers could use the pilfered key to impersonate other attendees by cloning their badges intended as a way for attendees to wirelessly zap their contact information to vendors
2016476 a key part of our information security history has been the vx group responsible for developing and spreading viruses before the internet was commonplace
2016477 he improvised the dosages of the drugs partly because of how conveniently or inconveniently they were packaged had no set protocol and kept no records of procedures
2016478 pray the prayer that never fails thy will be done
2016479 the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
2016480 worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
2016481 it would be low on the list of issues in 2008 for most people in network ops
2016482 if youre looking at it from a cio perspective its more than just how much extra bandwidth you have its how do your employees behave because its not a one size fits all answer and what enforcement do you in place to monitor them
2016483 what weve seen in the past is a significant up tick in the amount of traffic that is going on accessing these high bandwidth sites
2016484 the companies that are most progressive on this have established acceptable use policies and its not just the it guy that establishes it its the management team
2016485 this is obviously a welcome boost to our marketing of fresh pork under the specially selected pork brand and means we can effectively double our spend on behalf of the scottish pig sector when the campaign kicks off next saturday
2016486 our pig industry continues to face an uphill struggle in the wake of rising fuel fertiliser and feed costs
2016487 i know its there but i dont have any residual pain
2016488 in some cases there are costs benefits to outsourcing enterprise email but in all cases it frees up it resources
2016489 there will be functionality fall out between the premise based gear and the cloud based service
2016490 but thats not unique to email and those problems will get resolved over time
2016491 more than 200 million machines have been infected and all fortune 500 companies have infected machines
2016492 most organizations are often ill served with in house email
2016493 once an organization outsources its email it is relatively easy to later add additional features such as team collaboration enterprise instant messaging voice over ip web audio and video conferencing email archiving and ediscovery etc all as part of an integrated solution from the same provider
2016494 you can track traffic across different users networks and domains which make it easier to detect threats than just looking at one machine at a time

2016501 the amount of video being delivered for this years olympics exceeds all the prior summer games broadcasts in terms of hours and complexity
2016502 our biggest challenge is the scale of what we are doing and the many different standards of the various new media formats
2016503 it seems like every day nbc is signing up a new distribution outlet with a new format
2016504 we have done a lot of different video players for different clients what is unique about this one is bringing content that has never been seen before online up until relatively recently a very small amount of the games were televised now you watch every minute of whatever contest that you want to see

2016508 as many of you know the childrens music breakfast hosted by lynn orman and beth blenz clucas during the 50th anniversary grammy awards made one thing perfectly clear with so many amazing childrens music projects being released each year it is important that every artist submits and becomes a member of the academy to vote this was a point stressed by cathy fink and marcy marxer long time grammy members and previous award winners now it may be that a new push should be made to separate compilations from the pile to allow individual artists to triumph over entries such as the muppets or various disney soundtracks that have won in previous years the only way to do that is through a vocal membership comprised of people who care about this category www grammy com for your appropriate chapter artists producers and other related categories are all eligible to vote karen noted subsequently that artists who join after june 30 cant submit their own albums but they can still vote im sure that most of you are aware that the recording academy has recently mailed all information regarding the online entry process for the 51st grammy awards access to the online entry process will remain open to members from july 30 through september 3 all entries should be made during this period including releases planned through september 30 if you have already made entries as a record label representative there is no need to re enter them as all duplicate entries will be voided as a new member of the academy im looking forward to my first voting experience after watching my husband deliberate for so many years over the various categories if you have any questions please feel free to send an email my way if i dont know the answer i may be able to point you in the right direction
2016509 its the greatest test of golf i have ever played

2016512 its an excellent golf course its a great test of golf and patience

2016543 even the campbell government admits that the fuel tax will barely make a dent on our overall emissions reducing them by only 2 8 per cent by 2020
2016544 a preliminary estimate by m k jaccard and associates suggests that in the absence of other ghg reduction policies the carbon tax could reduce bcs ghg emissions in 2020 by up to 3 million tonnes of co2 equivalent annually
2016545 with the governments 100 climate change dividend most british columbians come out ahead on the tax
2016546 it is unfair that major industrial polluters dont have to pay the carbon tax while ordinary consumers do
2016547 i have been frustrated that the ndp continues to play the carbon tax as not applying to industry
2016548 emissions released intentionally or unintentionally during the production processing and transmission of fossil fuels in the oil and gas sector such as leaks from natural gas pipelines another example is the production of lime in making cement which has carbon dioxide as a byproduct
2016549 major industrial polluters dont have to pay the carbon tax while ordinary consumers do
2016550 so then we said ok if it takes 36 37 million tonnes to get all the way there and thats going to be a third of overall emissions then what number are we dealing with
2016551 as we put our final election platform piece together we will adjust to that number

2016590 using opendns or other dns services is a good immediate workaround as it lowers ones exposure instantly but does not fix it completely
2016591 dans presentation convinced all of its attendants of the reality of the problem and showed the ease and breadth of exploitation possibilities personally i think it is important that the press continues to highlight this issue and monitors progress

2016595 she was absolutely furious and they had a full blown argument they were screaming at each other and the next thing joss headbutted him

2016606 however in recent weeks genuine passengers using ryanairs website have been suffering long processing times and slower access because of the huge volume of information being downloaded from our website by these screenscrapers all over europe
2016607 in all cases this scraping activity is unlawful and in breach of both ryanair coms copyright and terms of use
2016608 at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel in the way that is convenient for them not making it even harder

2016617 ive had a great time in the national team over the past few years the world cup in 2006 especially was fascinating and a unique experience for me
2016618 it was a good talk we were absolutely on the same wavelength in evaluating the situation
2016619 i thanked him for great performances our success at the 2006 world cup is linked closely to his name because of the penalty shootout against argentina he also played a big role in our success at euro 2008
2016620 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
2016621 it has come to gamepros attention that certain parties on the internet want you to believe that there are no decent games coming out on the wii these people are malicious liars and you should not believe them
2016622 but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2016623 we would ask you as a matter of urgency to take personal immediate and direct action to resolve an increasingly threatening confrontation
2016624 kent police has held back from extending stop and search powers since the climate camp protestors arrived but we now feel it necessary to put an order in place that covers the whole of the hoo peninsula

2016632 they say we create a negative image they treat us like refugees and criminals
2016633 they are cracking down on us more than ever before they regard us as enemies who will disrupt the stability of the country
2016634 they ask us to embrace the olympic games to love the country love the party but they dont love us

2016637 this is official propaganda from the current political party in switzerland
2016638 this mousepad is supposed to advertise some finnish educational site
2016639 and the people here are crazy enough to rename the mars bar to hopp for the european soccer championship they also have a song and karaoke oh and the swiss also make a delicious chocolate called frigor which was so delicious that i ate it myself
2016640 but contractually a company that advertises jd powers wins isnt allowed to mention the fact that they had previously won a bunch if they somehow skip one year
2016641 as for the screwdriver the professional emblem refers to a pdp 11 based personal computer that digital sold maybe 1984 1986 ish they were the coolest looking computers if you watched buckaroo banzai the pc as tv that the president is watching was a decmate which was the pdp 8 version of the same thing a little smaller
2016642 all three of these policies are forms of second guessing consumers
2016643 if there was an overwhelming demand for conspicuous calorie counts then businesses would respond to that the fact that you dont see it indicates that they are not really clamoring to have that information thrust in their faces

2016655 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2016656 it is characteristic of every hubble servicing mission that when we leave hubble we leave it a better observatory than it was before
2016657 when the astronauts leave hubble for the last time we believe it will be at the apex of its capabilities
2016658 there will never have been a time in the past that hubble was more capable scientifically than it will be after this mission
2016659 this will be the first time that hubble has been fully instrumented every instrument slot filled with an active scientific instrument since december 1993
2016660 some of that technology that was envisioned for a fully robotic repair actually came to fruition in the form of the fastener capture plate
2016661 provides a good technical baseline for future work for developing a propulsion module for deorbiting hst
2016662 weve come a long way since costar days and really probably the new challenges now are trying to get the state of the art detectors into our instruments at the last possible moment
2016663 you start down the path of developing your sensors and the first ones that come out are never as good as the last ones that come out theres so much risk in building these sensors up and getting them to work and getting through all their qualifications that youre often so far behind the curve of technology by the time something needs to go into the instrument that your sensors are getting a little stale
2016664 a large proportion ballpark 40 50 of the most important science hubble has done in the past has been unexpected
2016665 questions have arisen we didnt even know how to ask when hubble was first launched the universe has many more surprises in store for us and i think with this incredibly powerful toolset of new instruments and restored instruments were going to stumble on the unexpected as we always traditionally have in the past
2016666 i dont think nasa does as well as it could do with capturing lessons learned from previous programs
2016667 it seems like every program that comes along theres a new set of people a new set of managers and they all think they know how they want it to get done and they go off and do it theres been a lot of effort over the years to generate databases and to pull together documents

2016695 this is about the investment that america is or is not making in the health of its citizens and its economy right now the nations brightest young researchers upon whom the future of american medicine rests are getting the message that biomedical research may be a dead end and they should explore other career options and in too many cases theyre taking that message to heart the presidents latest budget proposal that calls for another year without an increase will only make the problem worse
2016696 theres been a lot of discussion in the last year about the negative impact of the tight nih budget on senior researchers and their labs
2016697 but it appears that junior investigators may be having the toughest time in this fiscal climate theyre competing for funding with established researchers who are their mentors and finding that the financial support just isnt there or that they cant afford to support themselves while writing and rewriting grant proposals
2016698 the feedback i received from one reviewer was that my ideas were very innovative and had the potential to make a big impact but they were too risky
2016699 to succeed in reaching our goals we need the freedom to try risky things to develop new approaches and techniques
2016700 reviewers told us we have good data a strong team and well thought out experiments we didnt get funded just because there were others going for their second and third round who were waiting in line
2016701 with this tight funding situation ive stepped away from the riskier stuff
2016702 my salary and that of everyone in the lab is dependent on my getting grants you become very savvy to what is fundable
2016703 i dont worry about the difficulty of getting funding from nih for myself i worry more about what it means in terms of patient care the whole grant cycle can take 12 18 months and thats if youre successful on the first or second try in the meantime im seeing patients every day who could benefit from this research

2016743 the purchase of the montgomery ward and charles keath properties is very exciting
2016744 as recently as the 1990s montgomery ward was a pre eminent brand in the united states were hopeful that we can breathe new life into what was once an american retail icon
2016745 it is extremely difficult to grow consumer catalog businesses today were finding that more consumers are using internet search engines for shopping or are visiting name brand sites although the ward brand needs to be rebuilt it does have strong recognition among consumers
2016746 in all likelihood this issue will escalate and i understand could result in wto action focused specifically on how the u s government enforces its laws i cannot see how that can be in the interests of this country

2016790 the tragic price families are paying for gordon browns economic incompetence
2016791 even when the economic good times were rolling councils saw ever increased pressure on their social housing stock
2016792 now that the credit crunch is upon the country it appears that many thousands more people will be looking to councils to provide them with a permanent home as they find it either impossible to get on their housing ladder or see their home repossessed
2016793 faced with stagnant earnings rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills the weight of debt is taking its toll on the thousands of hard working families who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet

2016798 gender inequality is one of the key drivers of the pandemic the church is in a key position to transform attitudes within the community it cannot remain silent
2016799 gender inequalities leave women disempowered and more vulnerable to violence including rape
2016800 there are new laws about sexual violence in drc but any law without the collaboration of the community is useless
2016801 the church is an influential voice in many affected communities and so is best placed to address these deep rooted attitudes
2016802 it was the church that stood on the front line against slavery and against apartheid now the church must stand up against gender injustice
2016803 we work with churches tackling gender issues and harmful practices which put people at risk of infection we work with both men and women because to effectively address gender inequality we cannot leave men out

2016819 when we come back to things that really matter then peace begins to settle into our lives like golden sunlight sifting to a forest floor and somewhere deep down inside we know that simpler times are better times
2016820 it is the simple things of life that make living worthwhile the sweet fundamental things such as love and duty work and rest and living close to nature
2016821 avoid spending sizable chunks of our lives simply moving from one place to another turn necessary chores into family outings

2016830 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
2016831 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
2016832 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
2016833 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
2016834 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
2016835 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful

2016847 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
2016848 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
2016849 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work
2016850 if youre looking for ethnic meat then youve come to the right place
2016851 i cant begin to describe how much i love your blog youre so fucking hillarious i could kiss you
2016852 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
2016853 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
2016854 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2016855 its difficult really because the matches in june were played under the old laws the tri nations is being played under the new laws plus another few where everything is going to penalties and free kicks
2016856 so it has been a little bit difficult to judge that when you know its going to be a little bit different for us from august 1
2016857 a lot of the free kicks that are being given now will be full on penalties at the moment its tap and go or take a scrum
2016858 the lineouts could come back into vogue a bit more than they are in the tri nations at the moment where there seem to be probably more scrums than there are lineouts statistically which is a bit of a change from what we had
2016859 i suppose we wont fully know it and thats why it will be important to get the players in on games from the start of the season this year just to find their way themselves
2016860 with the elvs the passages of play are just going on for so much longer i think there was one super 14 game that went to six minutes at the very start whereas before a three minute phase would have been very long
2016861 id say we can expect three four or five of those in a game now a few more two minute phases and thats going to put its own demands on players too but its only perception
2016862 everybody is saying that the ball is in play more but the fact that its in play might not mean it is being run with ball in hand
2016863 there seems to be a lot more kicking than there was before and that is why mark tainton has been out and about with the players over the last three or four weeks
2016864 thats a skill we are going to have to improve on and it wont be good enough that just one or two guys are going to be able to kick the ball in the coming season
2016865 i think it is going to take four five maybe six guys to take the ball the length of the field
2016866 its been great really its been a bit nerve wracking just trying to get everything right and trying to get things off to a good start
2016867 the players have come in well we invited 45 players in so we have 40 of those in and they have all been working hard
2016868 we have been trying to get a balance between the provincial pre season which is everybodys pre season really because it has been a little bit shortened this year
2016869 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election

2016872 some people argue that the federal ban on abortion was just an isolated effort aimed at one medical procedure that its not part of a concerted effort to roll back the hard won rights of american women that presumption is also wrong
2016873 there was already a law in place in illinois that said that you always have to supply life saving treatment to any infant under any circumstances
2016874 it looked different in the catalog and now i dont like it
2016875 it was just maddox and brad just father and son time
2016876 the good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals
2016877 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects
2016878 no one wants to see a household lose their home and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well
2016879 the focus of lenders arrears management policies today is on seeking realistic alternatives that balance the interests of customer and lender
2016880 anyone who thinks they may be heading towards financial problems should contact their lender to discuss their options the earlier the better
2016881 inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2016882 we know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2016883 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head
2016884 whilst the rate of repossessions is not on the same scale as the early 90s we want to ensure that the right support is in place for those who might need it now because of global economic pressures
2016885 thats why we are expanding free legal representation at county courts which can make a real difference in ensuring that repossession is only ever used as a last resort
2016886 i would like to thank south dakotans for their patience prayers and strong support during the past year it is because of that support and my job performance over the past year that i know i am 100 percent capable of performing all of the duties of my job as south dakotas senior senator i have the full confidence of my doctors family and colleagues in the senate as i seek another six year term in the senate i am able to effectively communicate the needs of our state and my passionately held beliefs there is no better evidence of that than my record since returning to the senate nearly one year ago i have not missed a single vote i have acquired hundreds of millions of dollars for projects throughout south dakota and i chair attend and fully participate in committee and sub committee hearings i have been open and honest about my recovery while my speech continues to improve it is not yet 100 percent and i have not yet reached a point in my rehab where my participation in a debate would accurately reflect my capabilities therefore i will not participate in traditional political debates during this campaign
2016887 the impact of the dispute on ability to remain on track with the development of new fields both in terms of investments and implementation including adequate staffing
2016888 corporate governance issues of the magnitude that tnk bp is facing are not commensurate with an investment grade rating
2016889 does not have any major concerns at this point about the way the company will operate in the next couple of months without a ceo in russia executive responsibilities are clearly defined and the operations in the field which are the most important thing are performing well clearly if tnk bp were without a ceo for a number of months we may start facing problems this is why bp needs to move quickly with nominating a new ceo
2016890 it appears that the shareholders dispute is now having an impact on important external perceptions of the company
2016891 the project is not seeking to solve any major burning complex socio political or theological question it is simply about showing a sunny positive face of muslims which people dont tend to see
2016892 it gives dei a time to further negotiate with him for the future and to align their key sponsors for the next several years it gives martin a real good look at what the landscape will be like next season for him people will shuffle around to teams but not quite like we saw last year
2016893 it could be a whole different landscape for him next year as far as other opportunities but its also really good for both of them it gives dei a good opportunity to have more time with him to put together something thats a little bit longer
2016894 we need to win ball games no matter which way they come
2016895 we do have to solve our issues late in the game
2016896 if david wright goes down and they ask me to play third base what are you going to do can you expect the guy that fills in for david wright to be as good as david wright
2016897 its easy to say that once things happen but this is reality and in reality i only have nine wins
2016898 i dont blame it on anybody i dont feel sorry about things
2016899 i know what im capable of doing i know how i got to this point and how to do my job its just about being consistent and doing my job
2016900 thats what were waiting on while were struggling with this and still win games its a good thing because were going to eventually figure it out i have to keep trying to find their best possible matchups
2016901 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2016902 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
2016903 advertisers are attracted by the internet because the medium offers instant feedback and it is easier to monitor how users behave
2016904 with the introduction of social networks such as odnoklassniki and vkontakte the cost of advertising on the internet has been halved
2016905 with a new array of technical possibilities the internet in russia would draw away media buyers from print publications
2016906 but just as cinema and tv never destroyed the newspapers newspapers and news magazines will continue to occupy a niche in the advertisement market
2016907 so far in russia most of the online ads are distributed among three major search portals yandex rambler and google which recently acquired begun
2016908 what about me i dont have a thyroid youre not writing anything for me
2016909 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2016910 ahmed musa a young boy was killed by a bullet of the occupying forces in nilin
2016911 ya ahmed please give my regards and my love to abir your two pure souls will meet in paradise go in peace beloved do not fear for you are not alone there are others there waiting for you ready to greet you are more than a thousand palestinian children who have been killed since the year 2000 and though i hope with all my heart ahmed that you will be the last victim of these legitimized israeli war crimes i cannot help but wonder who will be killed next
2016912 my greatest fear is the loss of humanity among israeli troops because of the ongoing warfare
2016913 we got casey blake to play third base we added veterans in the bullpen jason johnson and brian falkenborg who have been around a bit obviously we have manny for a handful of days
2016914 not only that weve had progress with the kids and you expect that with the experience they are getting over a full season and the learning that comes with failure we have a new hitting coach in don mattingly we had takashi saito go down but jonathan broxton has stepped right in without a hiccup were making a push
2016915 it makes for a more formidable lineup at the top at the middle and at the bottom
2016916 we have a better chance to score when we can attack from different angles
2016917 you expect that of the kids with the opportunities theyve had
2016918 you look at matt kemp hes swinging the bat well after being an easy out at the beginning of the year hes become more patient andre ethier is a solid hitter instead of the two rookie third basemen weve added blake and russell martin is holding his own and done a good job everybody has gained some experience and thats what you hope will happen as you get close to the end of the season
2016919 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2016920 the way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started and have never finished
2016921 i am extremely concerned to hear of the trouble in odevaney gardens last night residents reported to me that they were petrified during the night as anti social behaviour escalated
2016922 since the collapse of the regeneration projects i have been calling for the minister for the environment and the minister for housing to give a commitment that the government will provide a rescue package to build the much needed social housing and community infrastructure
2016923 following last nights incidents residents from odevaney were queuing up in dublin city councils offices today seeking alternative accommodation from dublin city council it is tragic that the plans and hope for a new community have been replaced with such feelings of despair despondency
2016924 even before the collapse of the regeneration development residents had reported flashpoints in parts of the complex and requested assistance from dublin city council and the garda in dealing with the matter before it got out of hand
2016925 while i welcome dublin city councils statement that they will be installing more cctv cameras in the area to deal with the matter i am particularly mindful of the fact that dublin city council recently responded to a question from me on cctv by stating that
2016926 european stars and stripes is saddened to be leaving usag darmstadt our home for more than 60 years but at the same time we re excited about the prospect of integrating into the kaiserslautern military community

2016941 always difficult to predict this event since the top contenders rarely compete against each other prior to the world championships or olympics miankova and pchelnik of belarus have little championship experience but have thrown far this year
2016942 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
2016943 we can confirm that we have detected and have been tracking machines infected with what is sometimes known as coreflood within the region
2016944 newer variants are also likely created either by the group behind this bot network and by others seeking to create variants of their own
2016945 in the ggc alone for the month of january 2008 there were almost 160 000 bots broadcasting as the majority are in sleeper mode we estimate the actual number of compromised pc to be closer to half a million the issue is serious and unlikely to be related to just one particular gang

2016972 the spammers are launching more sophisticated and cleverly targeted attacks to make these attacks more local they are finding vulnerabilities in websites using these to infiltrate the hosting servers and sending spam through these
2016973 there is also the problem of botnets we have seen a huge upturn in the last three months people are still not updating their security regularly so malicious software in spam can infect their pcs
2016974 but another problem for computer users is many attacks are going under the radar they are not mass attacks and this means security software programs may not have developed the protection until it is too late for some people
2016975 these statistics are becoming increasingly worrying and for the average amount of spam blocked per person to have nearly quadrupled in the last three months suggests that action desperately needs to be taken
2016976 but that your theology has created a false image of the godhead

2017016 well i wasnt on a date with the special forces guy i was on a date with the other guy which was a pity if you were my date the next day i told all the folks in the bar that rule one for a man should be if you are on a date with a woman try not to bring along another man especially if he is way more appealing than you are not that it would have mattered the sf guy wasnt doing anything well he was trying to learn to fly a plane he actually pretty much knew how to fly a plane he just needed a few more hours couple landings or whatever so he was trying to do that he was on the job and he wasnt worried about me at least not much felt bad for me i think because he knew i didnt like my date
2017017 everything i wound up throwing him out of my house later that night he was trying to screw me i guess
2017018 well i wasnt going to screw him i had no interest in screwing him and he seemed to have a problem with that he asked me what was wrong with me must be something wrong with me if i dont want to screw him well bulllllllllhit maybe he felt entitled
2017019 well too bad you fly me to the grand canyon and then i have to screw you screw that i might have screwed him if he had a modicum of appeal but he did not i really didnt like the guy at all hey it was a blind date and everyone knows what that means it means you might not like the person this is understood by most so the date happens to be on a plane so what day of hell in many ways
2017020 are you kidding me i didnt like my date i said not at all and i did like the other guy i mean he was attractive but i have manners and so did he for that matter you know he said something to me he knew i didnt like the guy no one in their right mind would have
2017021 of course i am just stuck in small plane with 2 men you know what its like when youve got 2 men there
2017022 no i guess you dont well i do and you have to juggle you have to do all kinds of hijinks to manage the bastards oh come on there are 2 men
2017023 come to think of it probably not too smart for me to be there in the first place
2017024 aaah whatever if was a fix up it was a fix up and i said no like i always do to fix ups but next thing you know im on a plane having to be nice the sf guy felt sorry for me if he felt anything at all hey elsa your date is a dick yeah i know how about he be your date so i can relax it was like that he didnt help me much my problem i am on a date with a dick not his
2017025 yeah some people have no appeal and no idea they have no appeal because he sure was surprised when he found out i wasnt sleeping with him and even more shocked when i told him to get the fuck out get the fuck out thats how i said it too
2017026 the coalition parties have agreed in principle to launch an impeachment motion against president musharraf
2017027 there was a major breakthrough in the talks late last night we have agreed to impeach the president

2017031 higher cancer rates are also found in carrigaline ringaskiddy and passage monkstown but cobh urban is by far the worst and it is widely believed that this is a result of its proximity to the former plant
2017032 locals had regularly raised fears about the potential of carcinogenic and hazardous chemicals being present in the local water over the years but were regularly reassured that there was nothing to be concerned about it now turns out that the people of cobh and former workers had their health seriously put at risk
2017033 im so tired of beating myself at my own game its so lame
2017034 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
2017035 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
2017036 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death

2017087 frasca is an industry leader in flight simulation and has been able to obtain qualification for several flight training devices over the years
2017088 our success in the helicopter market is in part due to our ability to collect our own simulator data packages airframe manufactures are frequently not able or willing to offer simulation data packages as result frasca has invested and developed its own flight test capability this allows us to offer a turn key simulation solutions at a very competetive price

2017100 this is by far one of the most entertaining baseball blogs ive seen
2017101 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2017102 this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law
2017103 what are the chances your small kid sitting around in a town in vermont and you play on a little league team and you end up going to cuba

2017110 naturally capital inflows have shrunk due to a falling market
2017111 i believe that we will have net capital inflow in the second half but today it is difficult to estimate the inflow due to the continuing global financial crisis
2017112 how did you do that and where are those steps
2017113 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself
2017114 you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you

2017122 i was instructed by my chief that all releases in so far as government house is to be made by mr shawn gumataotao
2017123 i still decided to go ahead and meet with them and find out if they were ok and what process they used to take care of that and they indicated that the fire department was called and the fire personnel handled that
2017124 executive security let me know at the time the fire was being looked at they had also come upon an individual that was uninvited and there was some indication that inappropriate activity related to the controlled substance and so thats being looked into
2017125 it will be a race of craziness and which suits a creative and intelligent lunatic

2017130 in march it was disclosed that a laptop containing the records of more than 170 000 blood donors had been stolen in new york there have been a series of thefts of bank laptops containing the financial records and personal details of tens of thousands of customers
2017131 however the latest breach is one of the most serious yet as the breach appears to have taken place several months ago but was only determined in the past few days
2017132 i believe that in order to reassure the public generally the particular retail organisation whose data was based was hacked into should be identified
2017133 i am calling on the government to ask the data protection commissioner and the financial services regulator or carry out a full audit of the adequacy of existing safeguards and make recommendations as to the changes that should be made to improve security

2017136 british citizens have the right to marry whoever they choose but we want newcomers to succeed in our society and sign up to the standards we have in common that means freedom not being forced to marry someone and it means newcomers quickly acquiring a command of english with consequences for those who break the rules
2017137 compulsory english education in elementary schools is the best way to popularise this language if poland wants to be involved in the mainstream common knowledge of english is a basic factor

2017140 when we discuss the incentive method and assess it together with the current account deficit the importance of the change in production function becomes important for turkey
2017141 there is no short term solution for the current account deficit
2017142 turkeys ever expanding current account deficit has become the achilles heel of the countrys economy
2017143 what might the next emerging market financial crisis look like
2017144 emerging economies to various shocks including a slowdown in import demand in both china and the united states a fall in primary commodity prices increased costs and lower availability of external financing alternative patterns of exchange rate changes and pressures operating on monetary and fiscal policies in emerging economies
2017145 turkey and the long decade with the imf 1998 2008
2017146 to understand the significance of this figure current account balance gdp it has to be noted that turkey traditionally has never been a current account deficit prone economy over the last two decades the average of the current account balance hovered around plus and minus 1 5 2 0 percent with deficits exceeding 3 percent signalling for significant currency adjustments as had been realised in 1994 and 2001
2017147 in a world of low interest rates international investors were hungry for yield and so piled into currencies that offered higher interest rates namely those of britain australia new zealand and iceland as well as many emerging markets
2017148 a simple purchasing power parity exercise suggests that the new zealand dollar is 20 25 percent overvalued against the us dollar while the turkish lira is about 65 per cent overvalued the yen meanwhile is roughly 30 per cent undervalued
2017149 here western business pays tribute to a partial triumph of islam yet this is not an inexplicable paradox while terrorists in the name of the koran endeavour to destroy everything that functions this form of political islam has managed to bring a certain measure of political stability to the country to the delight of investors prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has managed to push through a policy of economic development and budgetary discipline and put an end to the repeated cycle of crises the seeming paradox lies in the fact that in so doing he has favoured the emergence of a powerful new middle class which votes for his party regardless of how islamist it might be
2017150 a 10 increase in petrol prices means turkeys current account deficit widens by another 4 billion
2017151 the main mechanism has been that the high rates of interest prevailing in the turkish asset markets attracted short term finance capital and in return the relative abundance of foreign exchange led to overvaluation of the lira local currency cheapened foreign exchange costs led to an import boom both in consumption and investment goods the overvaluation of the lira together with the greedy expectations of the arbitrageurs in an era of rampant financial glut in the global finance markets led to a severe rise in its foreign deficit and hence in external indebtedness
2017152 what is a significant risk is the significant exposure of the turkish corporate sector to foreign currency borrowing the turkish corporate sector as a whole is exposed to foreign currency risk
2017153 we used to have a noteworthy amount for financing with foreign direct capital then only private sector borrowing and portfolio investments remained the private sector continues borrowing one way or another however it is not easy to tell how long this may continue a proportion of the deficit financing was reportedly covered with the central banks reserves last month if we keep on using reserves to finance the deficit that may create problems in the future this may cause a significant pressure on the foreign currency
2017154 godard achieved for the cinema himself and his movement what jean paul sartre had accomplished in the late 1940s for philosophy himself and existentialism he made his movement the emblem of the times defined his medium as the one of the moment and personally became its exemplary figure
2017155 photography is truth and the cinema is truth twenty four times a second
2017156 justice to the most fertile period of godards career an era of magnificence and innovation that few other filmmakers have matched

2017181 kevin keehan has taken comfort from two of his senior players as he looks to get lewes off to a flying start
2017182 the fact that fitz and mikele were already here when we arrived was beneficial for us
2017183 it meant that they had given the players here an idea of what to expect when we got here
2017184 the other key factor is that we have some outstanding leaders in the dressing room people with integrity who believe in what we the staff are doing
2017185 mikele fitz adam bolder martin rowlands damien delaney and gavin mahon all have a very strong work ethic as individuals and theyve been leading the way

2017218 nice looking forward to see a new standard api for a pretty common problem issue
2017219 it s fair to expect some buzz on friday when san antonio hosting company rackspace takes a bow as tech ipos go the prospectus on this one reads like a pretty safe bet
2017220 analysts expect a relatively warm response to an ipo by rackspace hosting but the company faces tough competition in its attempt to produce long term growth
2017221 because the price is unknown until the end winners might think they paid too much and will unload shares to limit losses
2017222 no one here thinks that these results are in any shape or form satisfactory it has been a chastening experience and reporting a pre tax loss of 691m is something i and my colleagues regret very much this loss is a consequence of previously signalled writedowns on credit market exposures amounting to 5 9bn
2017223 the question with rbs and all other uk banks is the outlook for the uk economy and thats not good i think we have a lot more writedowns to come as the uk economy slips towards recession
2017224 it takes a brave person to try to predict the market by the end of the year but i feel a lot more confident about our markdowns than i did back in april business is getting done it doesnt feel like were heading back to the good old days but there is more movement
2017225 maybe the chairman sir tom mckillop probably will be the one that will have to fall on his sword simply because removing the ceo sir fred goodwin would be too disruptive to the organisation at this time and its just not responsible to do so
2017226 so if the investors want someones head they will probably go after the chairmans
2017227 i think rbs is unique in one area in that they are very dependent on the investment banking industry whereas the other high street banks dont have that much of a reliance on it
2017228 we are focused on very difficult market conditions we are focused here very much on doing whats right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time

2017238 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
2017239 i still like the road racing a lot its something that i look at we have probably a 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 shot of winning the race we put a lot of effort into our road racing not that we dont put a lot of effort into our oval racing this is something ive done for 15 years now and i have a lot of experience road racing
2017240 i think its probably difficult each direction the biggest thing on the oval is to back off early get it into the corner then get back on the gas its similar to how i run the road races as well i try to roll the middle as fast as i can and i think thats helped me on the road courses
2017241 but the short ovals i normally run pretty good at so it seems like that works there too
2017242 well i think scott riggs is a very good racecar driver well start there committed to running a second car you know wed love to run a second car i think our team and our facility and our systems and procedures and policies all that stuff is in place now to run a second car
2017243 you know we still havent won with one car but this weekends race hasnt happened yet either its important to make one car run good first and weve been able to stay inside of the top 35 but at the same time wed like to position ourselves to win races
2017244 the competitions so close especially with the new car the way it is today
2017245 i think any race right now is tough to win and i think the competitions close
2017246 i think hell do a good job at it the only words of wisdom that i gave him was and i only mean it in fun and games be careful what you wish for you might get it
2017247 when it comes to the central enterprise of higher education teaching students we dont know if the reigning professional qualification system works or how many professors we actually need

2017250 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains
2017251 this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
2017252 a bank selling off an reo property may help the bank but it does little for the average joe thats stuck with his unsold house and the need to further drop his price to match

2017259 it was a difficult one we had some difficult conditions out there but we had enough chances to win it
2017260 we had three clear chances in the first half and could have had two penalties in the second one for handball and one when jon macken was taken down when you look at it that way i guess we are disappointed not to get all three points
2017261 we did not get the goal but at the end of the day it is another point
2017262 its a dislocated elbow hes out for the weekend but theyll reset it and he could be back by next weekend
2017263 the way the lads signed off shows that they are good enough
2017264 what we have now is evidence that the worlds marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not too distant future
2017265 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
2017266 our results show that carbon dioxide induced acidification of seawater at levels predicted for the year 2100 reduced fertilisation success of an ecologically dominant marine species by 25 percent

2017272 the people of unst have proved highly resilient and creative in the face of an economic blow which would have daunted other communities
2017273 in the face of a huge upheaval they got their sleeves rolled up and worked with the response team to identify new opportunities and plan for the future
2017274 from the start we took the view that the former raf base was an asset which could become a different kind of economic hub for the island and thats what has been achieved
2017275 all our outlying islands continue to face serious challenges but unst has shown what can be done when people work together for the good of their community
2017276 their success to date is a great credit to the unst response team and to all the islanders it give us great hope that unst can look to the future and plan ahead with confidence

2017285 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president
2017286 furthermore old people die they die at a rate much faster than that of younger people peoples immune systems start going downhill at age 50 and practically collapse after age 70 and an old person dying in office could cause serious disruption in the u s government due to the various tests for incapacitation in the constitution being vague and unclear
2017287 my point is that a president dying in office is a disruptive event and the possibility of such disruption certainly should be factored in to anybodys decision
2017288 theres not even one girl in the bb house to help me out and be a girlfriend you have to be my girlfriend
2017289 that was the idea to follow what the hoh wanted

2017291 the process of democratization is likely to be messy and unsatisfactory but it is absolutely necessary
2017292 but our approach is in reality an extension of traditional tenets incorporating human rights and the promotion of democratic development into a policy meant to further our national interest
2017293 this is the great innovation of the millennium challenge account initiative more broadly we are now better aligning our foreign aid with our foreign policy goals so as to help developing countries move from war to peace poverty to prosperity poor governance to democracy and the rule of law at the same time we have launched historic efforts to help remove obstacles to democratic development by forgiving old debts feeding the hungry expanding access to education and fighting pandemics such as malaria and hiv aids

2017301 critics fear will evolve into cuban style community groups used to monitor and prevent counterrevolutionary activities
2017302 the opposition reeling from the release of 26 decrees on the legal system the economy and the military is also rallying against a ban on 272 people from seeking public office including at least five opposition members who planned to run in november the decrees bolster chavezs power by ending lawmakers oversight of government borrowing allowing him to appoint regional officials and opening much of the economy to government intervention the opposition which includes student and business groups conservative free marketeers and leftists disenchanted with the growth of centralized control had several meetings planned with mercosurs adriana pena today and will march in support of the excluded candidates the court decision set back opponents hopes of unseating some pro chavez governors and mayors in the coming elections

2017304 first of all i believe we were only just short last year we only lost three premier league games
2017305 we have kept the basis of the team and the frustration we got from not winning in the end will come out for the good we need to show strength and resolve but we have that
2017306 weve lost gilberto who was very experienced and important in the dressing room and weve lost hleb who weve replaced with nasri but we have many young players who are one year older and have learned we made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and we want to continue if we get into the same position again in march then i believe we will show the needed resilience
2017307 we had a month and a half after that game where our heads were not right
2017308 william has acknowledged that he made some mistakes and he has learnt from them
2017309 he is an important player and he plays in a position where it is easy to be the captain some of the other players who could be captain are still a bit young i believe at the moment that kolo will be his assistant
2017310 william got a lot of criticism after what happened at birmingham but until then everyone said he was a fantastic captain so i think he deserves another go to show his commitment and then well see where we stand at the end of the season
2017311 he was not the most gifted player when he was a young boy and he has a good evaluation of his own performances thats what makes the big players william has analysed what he has done right and wrong himself
2017312 i am pleased because he brings something to the premier league we want it to be the best league in the world therefore the best players in the world have to play there common sense and contracts have prevailed you wouldnt want to think that one of the best players in the world just walks out and doesnt respect his contract
2017313 i dont want to talk about ronaldo he is a united player
2017314 its a shame he is not coming because hes a player who would really have improved us but it doesnt matter we have a great group of players

2017330 i believe that the actions of the local naval command to withhold information of the leakage of the nuclear elements into guam waters over a two year period is inexcusable and unacceptable and as such today i am sending off a letter to the commander of the naval forces in the pacific admiral keating in hawaii for the removal of the local naval command
2017331 the hunger strike was a catalyst in the struggle for freedom and it is fitting that the struggle continues has been adopted as the theme of this years national hunger strike commemoration
2017332 the 1981 hunger strike is this young generations 1916 and it should be commemorated in the same manner the hunger strike for many marked a changing point in the struggle for freedom

2017353 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001
2017354 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair color
2017355 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2017356 skin is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
2017357 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process
2017358 right from the beginning our vision for tvs scooty brand has been to empower women and endow them with independence and self sufficiency

2017361 they said theyd try me there and while i was on the scout team we didnt have enough receivers and needed somebody with speed they liked the way i was practicing so they moved me to receiver
2017362 when he was on the scout team we all saw that cooter has tremendous speed
2017363 he will run right by you he has incredible moves and that speed gives him a cutback ability that other guys dont have

2017368 i was drafted in 1967 and i served in vietnam for 1 year so this area was mostly all free fire zones so it was with this understanding that it was a free fire zone that everything was fair game if at any time you saw people in any way trying to avoid you or run away or make suspicious movements that was free game you could go ahead and shoot them and kill them

2017370 a large number of people including children were killed by american snipers

2017377 this has to end and we are being very aggressive in how we deal with this issue
2017378 the police chief members of my staff and i have been working over the last couple days to develop a plan on how we address this issue in our commercial districts and across the city
2017379 the desperation of these crimes speak to the broader issue of where we are in terms of this economy when people become desperate they take desperate acts and we have to do everything we can to get to the root causes of crime and violence
2017380 as ive said before failure is not an option and we will continue to work every single day to address these issues
2017381 we are looking at the development of our police whether or not we engage these business corridors by bringing on private security or whether we bring in voluntary organizations like the guardian angels

2017383 the rights of muslim women in the quran theory and practice
2017384 the quran has innumerable verses in favour of women but men sometimes misinterpret verses related to polygamy and hijab to suit their whims and fancies
2017385 with no access to education most rural muslim women have no idea about the courts and the laws and even what the quran says about womens rights the need of the hour is to take up these cases and help women get their due rights they become easy victims and run from pillar to post when men desert them dump triple talaq on them and irresponsibly use polygamy as their birthright

2017392 what we see as hindu peaceful mentality it is nothing but inactive mind or plain cowardise
2017393 the posts celebrating holi and diwali did get us into a debate about the interactions between the hindu muslims during these events with the very nature of holi and diwali these have become national festivals today
2017394 the tragic price families are paying for gordon browns economic incompetence
2017395 even when the economic good times were rolling councils saw ever increased pressure on their social housing stock
2017396 now that the credit crunch is upon the country it appears that many thousands more people will be looking to councils to provide them with a permanent home as they find it either impossible to get on their housing ladder or see their home repossessed
2017397 faced with stagnant earnings rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills the weight of debt is taking its toll on the thousands of hard working families who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet
2017398 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects
2017399 with rising mortgage payments and sky high food and fuel costs it is little wonder that more and more peoples budgets have been driven to breaking point
2017400 the only people who are continuing to talk about it are the media this week
2017401 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
2017402 what i would want them to look at was whether or not the lawyers had a strong financial incentive to go to trial
2017403 im not suggesting the answer because i dont know but that would be my question
2017404 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
2017405 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
2017406 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex
2017407 i dont necessarily find that everything in this paper gels with everything that i have said on tax in the past and that is as it should be this is a treasury discussion paper which is out there to promote discussion
2017408 no doubt some people will find some of the observations a little uncomfortable
2017409 and i hope that i play at the level ive always played at theres no guarantees theres never been any guarantees from me the game of football is just that its a game of football and anything can happen but i will bring leadership and durability im a little bit out of shape compared to the other guys but im so excited about the opportunity
2017410 my interest at first im sure we all know was to stay within our division maybe that was a little bit of a vindictive nature or whatever competitive nature
2017411 there came a point when i realized what i had in my initial thoughts were not going to come true that i had to look elsewhere
2017412 were up against the clock and i want these guys to know me know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have im not a big talker im not gonna call team meetings im not going to rah rah im going to show up do what i have to do
2017413 a lot of things happened this off season a lot of shocking things i think were both at fault whos at fault more thats a matter of opinion but i really think at this point its irrelevant they probably are tired of talking about it i know its great for the media its a great soap opera
2017414 a lot of fun for me i think it was made clear this off season that they were moving forward some things happened in between that thats ok and you know its time for me to move forward
2017415 that it was below the limit of detection by personnel on the ship and was indistinguishable by the ship from no leakage at all
2017416 we are concerned about this new information and we will do everything we can to ensure the safety and well being of our people

2017421 more studies are necessary to fully elucidate and better understand green teas method of action particularly at the cellular level
2017422 the evidence is strong that green tea consumption is a useful dietary habit to lower the risk for as well as treat a number of chronic diseases certainly however smoking cessation is the best way to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer

2017428 what we discovered is that theres an active process of cellular machinery that prevents aneuploidy
2017429 its a surveillance mechanism involving the two proteins rae1 nup98 that makes sure that in every cell division the proper number of chromosomes occur
2017430 the reason we are investigating this in the first place is because 95 percent of all human cancers involve aneuploidy
2017431 when researchers show as we have just done new mechanisms that prevent aneuploidy we are helping improve the understanding of the basic science that we hope will lead to new cancer treatments one day

2017436 1 the business of designing making and selling highly fashionable usually custom made clothing for women
2017437 weve been over this before folks and i dont know how many times i have to beat into submission
2017438 in this case you are conflating couture with haute couture besides some stores have couture in their names and will just have to live in error or spend a fortune rebranding
2017439 our focus has really been on improving the design and build process throughout it s worked well for us and well for our partners

2017457 that school of protestants which maintains that the essence of the gospel consists in the doctrine of salvation by faith in the atoning death of christ and denies that either good works or the sacraments have any saving efficacy
2017458 our concern should be for truth and principles not for visible institutions organizations and movements
2017459 not the corrupt cultures that ultimately overwhelmed them and led to their predictable demise
2017460 we need to study healthy prostate tissue from 15 25 year old men to track this process understandably there is a lack of access to samples from men in this age group so to have found a way we can have an ongoing supply of prostate tissue is a significant milestone
2017461 as nearly every man will experience a problem with their prostate were very excited about the impact our research will have
2017462 the tissue weve grown behaves as a normal human prostate so its the perfect model for testing the different hormones and environmental factors we believe play a role in the onset of prostate disease
2017463 we grew the prostate tissue by telling the embryonic stem cells how to become a human prostate gland we then implanted the cells into mice where they developed into a human prostate secreting hormones and psa the substance in the blood used to diagnose prostate disease
2017464 if we can understand how to make normal prostate we can work out how bph develops as part of the normal ageing process
2017465 we will also have the opportunity to study the transition of healthy prostate tissue to cancer not only will this enable us to develop new more effective ways of treating diseases that affect nearly every man but we hope eventually to find a way to prevent these diseases in the first place
2017466 scientists have grown a complete human prostate from embryonic stem cells
2017467 ringtone royalties are minuscule in the overall scheme of things

2017472 guys are just smarter than girls in math just like guys have more upper body strength than girls
2017473 again the effort uncovered little difference as did a comparison of how well boys and girls did on questions requiring complex problem solving what the researchers did find though was a disturbing lack of questions that tested this ability in fact they found none whatsoever on the state assessments for nclb requiring them to turn to another data source for that part of the study

2017475 are you sure you want to upload prior period data yes or no

2017487 the blanket return of objects to their home countries would discourage cultural tourism
2017488 we want people in britain to see kenyan artifacts at their own museums but the most important ones must come home
2017489 people have got to learn that clicking on links in messages can lead to a malware infection whether the messages are in your e mail or on a site like facebook
2017490 there has been a flurry of malicious e mail messages recently posing as links to videos so theres really no excuse not to know that this trick is being commonly used by hackers at the moment
2017491 ngko tak sesuwaiiii pakai yang besar2 sangat so aku pilih untuk ko yang sedang2 ajer
2017492 did i ever think that this scenario would present itself
2017493 i would keep our conversations private on that except to say that we are taking things season by season
2017494 we are really happy to have him for the season and we will move forward from there
2017495 this is a bittersweet moment i have the greatest respect in the world for chad
2017496 i have far too many things to do but most of them are not exciting

2017504 you want your husband or boyfriend or whoever your husband yeah there we go to be circumcised
2017505 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him
2017506 he even stopped shooting so he could go to the doctor and get it checked out we all had to wait around for him to come back
2017507 on his return i tried to discuss the scene with him again and he started complaining about the doctor who had said there was nothing wrong with him
2017508 now theyre launching a web site in which the would be plaintiffs tell the lawyers what they want to sue for

2017528 by laying out the terms and conditions of the marriage it encourages both parties to establish consensus on issues such as where they will live
2017529 problems arise when couples dont know what to expect the lack of respect for each others personality and choices is shocking
2017530 santana just 9 7 in his first season with the mets left with a 3 1 lead in the eighth it was the sixth time in 24 starts this season that the bullpen cost him a potential win and in five of those the collapse came in the ninth inning he has eight no decisions and in seven of those allowed two runs or fewer
2017531 damn we just payed this dude 1 000 000 000 and he really sucks
2017532 here is a summary bit of information about that data with defensive runs saved drs in parentheses
2017533 immediate future are wright reyes and santana mere bluechip prospects for the long haul down the future
2017534 will anyone here really be suprised if the fish come in and slap them around
2017535 individual wins are meaningless for this team throw together a few good weeks then we can maybe get excited
2017536 hi im thinking of coming in to dine and im allergic to nuts and fish and im wondering if the kitchen feels comfortable handling that
2017537 uh no im allergic to nuts and fish they could kill me
2017538 if mats comes to me and says i will sign but i have to have a no trade contract and it is a one year contract he has got it

2017544 what if he has a big name secular rock band come here and do a concert
2017545 lead but dont bear oppressive rule over them be an example to them reprove and rebuke yes but encourage also be tender as a nursing mother dont huckster the word but use plainness of speech
2017546 support them materially submit to their leadership yield and obey follow their example make it your job to see to it that their oversight of you is a joyful affair not a burdensome heartbreak
2017547 it all comes down to whether were really seeking god or whether were seeking a fantasy of our own creation and calling it
2017548 by golly not in my church that i never attend dont support and to which i break my god witnessed vow every week of the year
2017549 i know what the bible says but its just not practical

2017551 what if a christian woman astronaut finds people on a distant planet and wins them to christ and donsands
2017552 looking for rationality where there is none to be found

2017554 what if he has a big name secular rock band come here and do a concert
2017555 perhaps the pastor was not biblically qualified and should have been challenged
2017556 glad to hear that you have been voted back into the eldership at your church
2017557 oh let me add quickly we didnt fill out the faith promise cards at home and then hand them in no no we filled them out in the service while the pastor stood in the pulpit and told us how much of gods blessings you would be missing out on if you didnt step out in faith and give a little extra etc basically he guilt tripped us while we filled them out it was definitely a high pressure sales pitch
2017558 oh no not again after reading the story displayed so prominently in the sara mead took it a step further offering some tremendous resources to help reporters find more meaningful stories about pre kindergarten
2017559 with each episode of the crime procedural starting with a tip leading to a violent crime that may or may not be related to the strangler
2017560 all of our partners are now taking a whole reassessment about sharing intelligence with the us as anyone would
2017561 i thought why me i didnt know how to handle it
2017562 i didnt know anyone with diabetes there was no familiar face in music or sports that i could connect with but i started to see it as an opportunity to be an inspiration to a generation that doesnt openly talk about having diabetes and not feeling embarrassed by the disease
2017563 i remember when i was first diagnosed i was like i can do this and then sometimes it became alright i need somebodys help so id say can you do my needle for me today its ok to rely on other people and just be positive and keep going
2017564 the biggest challenge is managing it before i go on stage and making sure i keep a watch on my blood sugar throughout the day its always very important there are times when you cant really help what happens to the sugar because part of it is kind of unpredictable
2017565 no i the sophist says this let us blame the politicians for the bilateral agreements they have made with several countries for the sole purpose of transfering wealth to those countries while here you got people calling the transfer of wealth just an exchange of wealth

2017570 it is the humanitarian communitys obligation to see that the humanitarian needs are fulfilled
2017571 the humanitarian community has not been able to fully support what was jointly established
2017572 the ethiopian government is facing the crisis and is ready to admit figures it wouldnt admit in april and march
2017573 we welcome any acknowledgement of additional needs because it allows the international community to respond but now its a question of logistics and time lags
2017574 this troubling situation is unlike any the world has faced before
2017575 the challenge is not simply to deal with a temporary rise in grain prices as in the past but rather to quickly alter those trends whose cumulative effects collectively threaten the food security that is a hallmark of civilization

2017584 seems to me that its inherently impossible to prove a causal connection between climate and weather theyre just two different things
2017585 this caused that it would be nice if climate and weather were that simple

2017599 we chose infosphere warehouse because it was compatible with our existing infrastructure and we believe its proven high performance will provide some added tools to help us evaluate our marketing and management tactics

2017604 re engineering the yeast glycosylation system to fully replicate the full repertoire of human glycosylation reactions has been a challenging six year effort that many doubted could be accomplished
2017605 this achievement required both the elimination of yeast specific glycosylation reactions and the introduction of 14 heterologous genes making this one of the most complex cellular engineering endeavors reported to date
2017606 switching to this technology will also provide improvements in product uniformity and overall production economics
2017607 by engineering yeast to perform the final and most complex step of human glycosylation we are now able to conduct far more extensive structure function investigations on a much wider range of therapeutic protein targets

2017614 we need a fresh vision for asia in the 21st century for each of our beloved nations that are made up of individuals families communities and a mosaic of races language religious traditions and cultures a vision that is born out of the biblical world view and honours jesus christ lord of our nations and asia
2017615 hence the un reached peoples groups is the greatest challenge to the church here
2017616 today there are increasing number of natural disasters like tsunami cyclones earthquakes and the call to rebuild and restore these nations the church in asia cannot ignore then there is chaos in south and east asia due to military rule war in countries like afghanistan sri lanka pakistan resulting in thousand of lost lives and destitution
2017617 christians have been persecuted in this century than in all previous centuries put together one s patriotism is determined by one s religious identity and this must be countered
2017618 i dont see why not my swing feels good i feel strong and my body feels good if they ask me ill tell them im ready to go
2017619 i feel good and i was getting out the people i was supposed to get out this season has not been like anybody expected not doing anything to help the team but if i keep throwing the way i was down there im ready to get people out
2017620 every day the rest of this season is going to be a test of our resiliency
2017621 he changes the game with one swing hes one of the big superstars in the game he loosens us up as a team with his charisma and character in the dugout hes a huge part of who we are and i dont want to say hes our sparkplug because he bombs the ball out of the park but at the same time he gets us going
2017622 they lost 120 games and casey still wouldnt even look at me
2017623 i couldnt see well enough to play when i was a boy so they gave me a special job they made me the umpire
2017624 thats a lot of money to pay for comedy material
2017625 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan is an issue for the pakistani people to decide
2017626 its about time youve realized ive been working my a off
2017627 daddy was a cop on the east side of chicago
2017628 we are aware of a letter from the ec to the uk government regarding the governments implementation of eu directives on data privacy any such letter is a matter between the commission and the eu member state
2017629 however we are in active dialogue with the european commission and the uk government we will continue to work with legislators and regulators to ensure that our legally compliant system is deployed in a way that exceeds current internet advertising industry standards for privacy online
2017630 it is important to note that with our technology participation will always be a transparent choice
2017631 not so long ago americans represented america and kenyans represented kenya and russians represented russia
2017632 once every four years we could root for us and with all our heart we could root against them
2017633 no longer black and white theyre gray and gray is worse than ugly gray is boring
2017634 the beijing olympics begin tomorrow with the official opening ceremony which promises to be a lavish affair
2017635 the police chief and the sheriff have reached public conclusions about the propriety of what happened without conducting any investigation whatsoever and without even talking to us all
2017636 when the team made entry into the house they were engaged by the dogs
2017637 the deputies opened fire and executed our dogs the very second they broke down the front door
2017638 they were really kind dogs and they were really nice to all the children who loved to pet them and stuff
2017639 what disturbs me most is the fact that this could happen to any of us who would have a box on your front porch
2017640 our investigators went in and showed both restraint and compassion not arresting the mayor or any members of us family after determining theyre unlikely involvement
2017641 not only did they not apologize but they refused to clear our names and then they went on to defend what we consider indefensible action
2017642 she came in and gave me a hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2017643 i do not for one minute believe that this election shows london has been transformed overnight into a conservative city but i do hope it does show that the conservatives have changed into a party that can again be trusted after 30 years with the greatest most cosmopolitan multiracial generous hearted city on earth
2017644 if the conservatives are going to be coming into power next time around then lets share ideas and lets work something up together
2017645 unpredictable is a good description of the administration at the moment
2017646 i think that cameron is keeping a very close eye on what boris is up to but he is also not getting too close i think that if it all goes well he will claim it as an example of modern conservatism and if it goes badly it will be portrayed as boris being boris
2017647 we dont quite know what he is about yet and it can sometimes be a bit chaotic but most people are just watching and waiting to see what happens
2017648 the thing with johnson is that he is bright enough to pick up anything but i think his attention span is pretty short and to be honest the detail bores him
2017649 it is not enough to be seriously damaging yet but it is very different to how it was under ken where everyone knew straight away what the line would be and knew they had to stick to it
2017650 what you see is absolutely what you get with boris
2017651 he is often in the canteen wandering around with his tray and a banana chatting to whoever he comes across his warmth is genuine and quite irresistible
2017652 with little more than a slap on the back and a proclamation that cripes we could really use someone like you offers them a job
2017653 the weekend of the ray lewis resignation he was punch drunk with it all
2017654 he appeared befuddled and bemused like an older boy who had been happily playing with children in a country house and then something had gone wrong and he just deflated he seemed confused and a bit sad
2017655 the over riding impression is of johnson standing by his black deputy which helps to negate accusations of racism that were made during the campaign
2017656 tackle crime deliver value for money and improve the quality of life for all londoners
2017657 we really dont know which boris we are dealing with yet
2017658 is it the telegraph columnist with strange views on race boris the one nation tory or boris who cried when margaret thatcher resigned
2017659 the truth is that the first 100 days is really the transition period and he has done more or less exactly what i would want to have done ken livingstone quite understandably created the greater london authority in his own image and that means that there is a lot of work to do before we start to get a clear impression of what this administration is really about
2017660 millions of people visit sites like youtube to share their videos everyday yet before now no computer manufacturer has built a pc dedicated to the needs of this community
2017661 we decided it was time to provide these aspiring filmmakers with a professional video editing solution
2017662 this morning two planes were delayed for half an hour because the visibility was only 200 metres 656 ft because smoke and smog shrouded the airport
2017663 they took a little more time collecting the right fruit picking the right size the right color and berries with good shape
2017664 the time period is not so much different as it would be shipping from here to chicago
2017665 we wanted to make sure they stayed cool so they would arrive in the best possible quality
2017666 we dont know how much it was affected by the earthquake but i wouldnt want to blame it on that
2017667 we basically returned to what we would consider normal cyclicality for the june quarter
2017668 if you went back a year ago and looked at percentage of our revenue that is servers it is decreased at same time practices we wanted to be in and our service business are growing quite substantially we are reacting to the market and the market is reacting to us thats not to say our server total volume has gone down our volume has increased dramatically in total

2017681 lance felt that kate came on too strong too fast she started talking marriage and babies almost right away he freaked out at her clinginess and bailed
2017682 lance realised he wasnt so committed to the relationship and shouldnt pursue it anymore
2017683 its so hard for me because im so open to hold back i could really just go on forever about this stuff
2017684 there was a sharp crunch in the equity market and that led to an outflow of funds and the purchase of hard currency

2017885 they told me they wanted this bill to reflect my taste in music
2017886 i said yeah but youre a big corporation and i want to do this thing in a big way
2017887 he was highly strategic in what he was looking for in each and every artist it was not only about uniqueness and innovation of the individual acts but the harmony and synergy that would be gained by having them share the bill together
2017888 music is a defining influence in our customers lives we set out to offer our customers an unparalleled music experience at a great value
2017889 its all good music and all musicians i would be personally excited about seeing by themselves let alone the smorgasbord weve put together
2017890 theres not anything to prove those bands have proven it themselves and its a great lineup of musicians and people juxtaposing different bands together has always been a cool and interesting thing but there was nothing i had a need to do by putting certain people on the bill
2017891 to put someone like ringo starr or willie nelson or bob dylan out there someone who has been alive for a long time and has been shaping the landscape of music on the bill and then see how it goes
2017892 i had that buzz youre talking about three months ago when i was devising this thing and going through the efforts to get everybody to play music i had it then and now its coming back round 2 of this buzz i still cant believe all of that musical ability will be playing on a street in pittsburgh
2017893 i like to play music but so far no one has reached out to me and im not about imposing my will on any band im not expecting to perform but i suppose if someone asks me

2017896 throughout his iconic career bob dylan has maintained a special relationship with the hohner company and has showcased our harmonicas in his music at this time hohner is honoring that association by offering our collection of limited edition hand signed marine band harmonicas to the public this is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity for bob dylan fans and we hope that those who are able to own these items will treasure them as a reflection of his musical genius
2017897 in addition to our release of these limited edition pieces hohners collaboration with bob dylan naturally led to the development of a next generation harmonica
2017898 this new harmonica has an enhanced sonic versatility and produces both uncharacteristically warm tones while also achieving a brilliance or brightness that allows musicians to more freely express themselves it was not easy to achieve the standard that bob dylan represents among other things we gold plated the reed plate in order to achieve the specific sonic requirements

2017910 ive always tried to point out inequities but i never believed music could change the world
2017911 madonna influenced fashion there were beatles haircuts bob dylan changed some young people not a lot
2017912 nothing can save the music industry as we know it
2017913 i dont know what record companies can do to survive the gigantic changes of these last 15 years
2017914 the subject matter is more adult the lyrics more concise theres never a wasted word
2017915 bob dylan and joni mitchell are well known but if you talk to his peers randy is right up there
2017916 hes complex and so literate with an amazing ability to write humorously about the shortcomings and strengths of the human spirit
2017917 i always have to go these discursive routes to write a straight love song
2017918 its incomprehensible to me that my father would tell her about one of the worst days of my life
2017919 you have a boss when he likes what you do youre a little puppy dog and then the next day you think hes an idiot again
2017920 i wanted to put strings over a shot of ren e zellweger standing in a doorway
2017921 it would have glamorized her but clooney had never directed a picture with a traditional score and he was not comfortable with it new directors somehow think its cheating to use music as if they didnt shoot the scene well
2017922 i heard whole lotta love but not kashmir so i didnt realize how good they were
2017923 the key to the whole process is the pledge from kildare county council that 200 000 is available in their budget to build the playground in 2009
2017924 all stakeholders are optimistic that we will soon be able to finalise this worthwhile project and kilcullen will then finally have the safe secure and enjoyable public space to play which is so important for a childs social development and well being

2017926 service providers are telling us as hardware margins continue to get squeezed that they are looking to get into the software and services side of the arena

2017930 its kept under the roof to comply with the ohio department of agricultures rules and regulations for handling manure and applying it to the ground so that it isnt applied in excessive amounts the technology that we employ will to a large extent make that a much simpler easier process that wont cause as many external problems
2017931 mpps have indicated they do not want to meet for fear of jeopardizing the work of the detroit river international crossing study a binational government process to determine the location of the next windsor detroit border crossing
2017932 if we attempt to influence the project decision for political reasons it will scupper the whole thing and set us back
2017933 but the federal government remains behind the binational process said a spokeswoman for transport minister jean lapierre
2017934 we have no choice otherwise there will be legal challenges i know it may look like a lot but it will only be a short time for a narrowed list of alternatives to be ready by december
2017935 we have a process and we have to respect that its not only in canada but it involves both countries we are going to stick to the process the next couple of months we will see whether we can speed it up we are following it closely
2017936 local mpp dwight duncan l windsor st clair also remains supportive of the binational process but admitted it is dragging on too long
2017937 many of these in my view are undesirable and will be quickly ruled out
2017938 there is a process we have to go through it is too long and cumbersome but at the end of the day we should have the best alternative
2017939 the fact is these are the rules of the game
2017940 there is a significant and long standing trade partnership between ontario and michigan and canada and the united states representing a key source of prosperity for all sides we recognize that both our economies depend on the efficient flow of cross border traffic this requires that we have modern border crossings including the construction of a new one between windsor and detroit canada is thus actively participating along with the united states michigan and ontario in the detroit river international crossing dric study significant planning work has been completed to date and we look forward to constructing the new crossing as quickly as possible
2017941 collapse of wto talks presents challenge for canada nobody should be surprised at the collapse of the doha round of world trade organization talks this week everybody should be disappointed everybody that is except the greedy farm lobbies canadian dairy and poultry farmers included who fight ceaselessly to maintain their cushy sinecures regardless of the cost to consumers in their own countries or the devastating loss of opportunity for people in poor parts of the world and except for the legions of bureaucrats who jet around the world on expense accounts for endless rounds of talks that can be counted on to yield still more trips when they fail canadas reaction well now focus on new bilateral deals instead of a global pact according to federal trade minister michael fortier may be the best that can be salvaged from this seven year long exercise in futility but this is a weak second best result compared to what a breakthrough would have meant
2017942 simplexity the idea that simple things can be surprisingly complex and complex things can be deceptively simple this growing field of study reveals that all manner of phenomena epidemics traffic even politics move through tiny choke points seemingly inconsequential junction boxes that may shape the very direction of history the most powerful of the simplexity concepts however is choke points the keyholes in complex systems that can sometimes shut them down entirely the london cholera epidemic of 1854 which could have claimed thousands of lives was stopped cold when physician john snow traced the contagion to a single contaminated water pump on broad street the complex epidemic collided with the simple fix of shutting down the pump and the simple fix won the streets of new york city are nothing if not a web of choke points new york urban planner sam schwartz likes to point out that although about 1 million cars enter and leave manhattan every day only about 8 000 are in use in midtown at any one moment it takes just a few hundred extra cars to gridlock the 8 000 and the 8 000 in turn bring the 1 million to a halt

2017955 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
2017956 we also wanted to know about the history of the neandertals themselves
2017957 most argue there were a few thousand neandertals that roamed over europe 40 000 years ago
2017958 its still an open question for the future whether this small group of neandertals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
2017959 people hear that word disco and they see bellbottoms and that 70s show no no no this is real liberation music for people who know where to go this is the real deal
2017960 he always demanded that female workers signaled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word i didnt realize at first that he wasnt speaking metaphorically
2017961 according to a recent survey 100 percent of female professionals said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by their bosses 32 percent said they had had intercourse with them at least once and another seven percent claimed to have been raped
2017962 nancy jumped at the chance to take a picture of paul with us
2017963 they told us they were on a rip and going to st louis before heading west no one could believe it was really him he was so laidback and ordinary
2017964 the road trip was nancys idea as a way of them getting to bond and spend time together just the two of them
2017965 theyve been talking about the holiday non stop and were so excited
2017966 its the perfect way for them to both get away from it all and really get to know each other paul even packed his guitar
2017967 domestically russia needs an independent legal and law enforcement system free of political interference and one that wont be used to assist private parties in civil disputes it needs the consistent application of the rule of law and it must recognize that an all powerful fear inducing intelligence organization isnt the appropriate training ground for leaders of a liberal democracy
2017968 our law enforcement agencies and government authorities should stop causing nightmares for business he said
2017969 we need to create a normal investment climate in our country

2017977 to avoid turning the slowdown into a slump as soon as conditions allow the banks next rate move should be down
2017978 the longer inflation fears force the mpc money policy committee to leave interest rates on hold at 5 the more severe the looming recession will be interest rates will eventually have to fall very far to lift the u k economy out of its current malaise
2017979 once interest rates start to fall i think that they will be cut rapidly perhaps all the way to 3 5 by next summer and perhaps even lower subsequently however this will come too late to prevent an outright recession later this year and a long period of very weak economic activity thereafter
2017980 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels
2017981 it would be wrong to suggest that the market conditions over the foreseeable future will be anything other than tough
2017982 here it is you can have it too if you want
2017983 weve gotten started doing some lego games on the warner ip
2017984 to be able to dabble around in cg and film would be interesting
2017985 warner allows me to push in those directions without quitting the day job so to speak
2017986 the review has its origins in the credit crunch and more specifically in the problems experienced by the guernsey subsidiary of northern rock plc prior to its transfer into public ownership
2017987 that episode led us to consider the vulnerabilities inherent in a banking model that is widely used in guernsey which involves gathering retail deposits and then lending a large proportion of those funds to the parent bank what we call upstreaming
2017988 there is a need both to protect members of the public and to safeguard guernseys reputation
2017989 as i explained in our annual report earlier this year the credit crunch made it clear that we needed to review how we regulate banks now is the time for us to consult on those aspects of the changes that affect banks and the public directly
2017990 the way forward which is being suggested would involve limiting the costs by having the commission provide resources to support an ombudsman in a way which did not conflict with our supervisory and regulatory responsibilities

2017993 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
2017994 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward

2017998 the id is the dark inaccessible part of our personality what little we know of it we have learnt from our study of the dream work and of the construction of neurotic symptoms and most of this is of a negative character and can be described only as a contrast to the ego we approach the id with analogies we call it a chaos a cauldron full of seething excitations it is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts but it has no organization produces no collective will but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle

2018010 ginn has a history of drops and he is very inconsistent with his ability to show great quickness and burst he has long speed and will make plays down the field but he does take a moment to get going he is not very sure handed and he has very weak wrists the ball never stops softly in his hands and he is always bending his wrist to make the catch this is not a good trait for wide receivers to possess

2018032 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
2018033 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
2018034 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
2018035 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations
2018036 i think it s probably connected with sadr s militia and his direction to calm down

2018039 all too often claims that meat is linked to cancer are made as if they are proven fact but todays panel presented compelling evidence the conventional wisdom is not always current or accurate
2018040 if someone today said the world was flat wed laugh because thats such an uninformed and disproved hypothesis
2018041 we need to put some of our notions about meat and cancer nitrite risks and other issues into that same mythological category the public has been saturated for so long with these claims that theyve been incorporated into our belief systems but just as the world isnt flat meat cured with sodium nitrite is both safe and nutritious

2018070 there is going to be introduced a limit and no one can say what should we expect from the coming winter the energy sector is unpredictable in terms of problematic situations
2018071 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
2018072 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
2018073 ideally babies should be placed on their tummies after every nap diaper change and feeding starting with 1 2 minutes
2018074 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
2018075 the effect i am afraid will be more cambridge suites than colonial george iii
2018076 would be unthinkable in a country that values its past
2018077 sadly in the less noble city of halifax where heritage groups are treated with derision history is carted away in a dumpster without public outcry
2018078 there was asbestos found in those areas so it had to be removed
2018079 we removed a lot of the wall plaster from the main floor area
2018080 we had asbestos containing plaster on over the original plaster asbestos wasnt widely used until the 1930s so that would have gone on over the original plaster sometime after the 30s they put it on as kind of a sort of slurry stucco coat we tried to separate the two but you couldnt
2018081 but none of the grand rooms not the ballroom or the living room because that plaster was still original
2018082 to put plaster in is hugely expensive in this day and age as opposed to drywall
2018083 there isnt page after page of them anymore its been a struggle even to find a few people who will do plaster mouldings still its kind of a dying art
2018084 everything that you take out and dont replace in kind thats kind of a no no but in certain instances you really dont have a choice
2018085 i dont think theres any question that that would be the most desirable thing
2018086 the texture will be the same it will be a paint finish the same as is on the original plaster
2018087 theres the whole weight and the sonority of the rooms and the texture of the finish all of those things come into play theres absolutely no comparison
2018088 theres a certain patina thats extremely hard to fudge and that finish is built up over centuries its the difference between an original tudor brickwork palace and a fake suburban tudor half timbered monstrosity
2018089 weve saved samples of them and we will have new plaster mouldings made to match them and put back up
2018090 after hanging there with nothing but gravity affecting them for a couple of hundred years theyre getting a bit loose
2018091 ditto who cares its only a building big deal eh is right
2018092 i mean its better than paying 5 for gas so i hope it goes down more i think theyre prepping us for another big bump come about labor day
2018093 did you see 3d go to tripple ot against sk

2018099 our revenues continued to grow as we benefited from our large international customer base the recurring nature of our software and service fee revenues and our enhanced product portfolio
2018100 we continue to manage operating expenses add new blue chip customers despite a challenging economic environment and achieve double digit increases in mobile broadband revenues our growth combined with stabilized gross margins positions us to enhance shareholder value in the second half of the year
2018101 there were as many clash fans on those nights as who fans
2018102 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2018103 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2018104 i repeat the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the united states should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council and to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to asses georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2018105 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences we will continue to be engaged
2018106 acting like hes already the president and giving orders to people
2018107 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2018108 president bush did speak with russian prime minister vladimir putin about the issue earlier in the day at a luncheon in china please note they spoke several hours before these latest developments
2018109 get your behinds to the table and lets talk this out and see what unarmed resolutions you can come up with and behave yourselves while youre at it

2018127 i think its incumbent on the zoo to have a higher calling
2018128 undermine the ability of the zoo to remain a robust institution
2018129 there should be no doubt nhs greater glasgow and clyde owe the patients and the families concerned an unconditional apology
2018130 this was in the main a case of the nhs investigating the nhs
2018131 if it had not been for the persistence of the families we are clear that the matter would have been covered up and swept under the carpet there has been a massive systems failure and we need an open transparent and independent public inquiry to get answers
2018132 the dsg may be the worlds sportiest automatic but its not the ultimate manual
2018133 would i buy one sure if i didnt have a left leg
2018134 they were stores of some type we just dont know what they were selling who was running them
2018135 we know that it was pretty secretive whatever it was that was down here because not too many people know anything about it
2018136 you know you just think of the underground as such a dark spooky place but to think that this could have maybe been some kind of vibrant economic center is just kind of baffling really
2018137 i think it would just be kind of tragic if no one knew what it was or if no one cared
2018138 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2018139 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
2018140 just more political bs in an attempt to scam america again
2018141 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
2018142 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2018143 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2018144 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2018145 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
2018146 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
2018147 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
2018148 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
2018149 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate
2018150 pork producers need more time to adjust to the volatility of the grain markets and to the governments ethanol mandate which this year is requiring the ethanol industry to use about one third of the total u s corn crop that has contributed to the uncertainty with regard to feed grain supplies and prices

2018175 crescent phase is where the starlight would be glancing off the edge of the planet toward our telescopes
2018176 that would be when the light is coming at the surface at a very steep angle and the specular reflection would be the strongest and most intense
2018177 it could be water and land it could be some other liquids particularly where its further out where you might have methane like on titan
2018178 if we have an idea of how far away the planet is from the star and how bright the star is then maybe we could say methane would not be liquid at those temperatures
2018179 particularly if there was spectroscopic evidence of water vapor in the atmosphere

2018181 a segment of clients was recently notified of a change in the status of their home equity line of credit due to a change in the value of their property and or their credit profile

2018190 the absolute level of congestion during 2007 was effectively identical to the representative value for conditions before the scheme was introduced in 2002
2018191 in other words journey times inside the zone during 2007 were comparable to those prior to charging
2018192 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument
2018193 i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london one that gives greater consideration to how all transport measures impact on the movement of traffic on our roads
2018194 i have scrapped the co2 charge that risked thousands of small cars flooding central london and have asked transport for london to bring forward a range of measures to turnaround the trend and halt the squeezing of road space that has continued to worsen congestion
2018195 look im sorry its just the death star blown up by a bunch of fuckin teenagers

2018201 in terms of an asthma gene there have been quite a few reports but not one that can be clearly reproduced in samples
2018202 i think eventually it will lead to new therapies because it points to a specific biological molecular pathway once we understand the biology and we know the players its possible to target with specific drugs
2018203 before we finished the paper we would have guessed ormdl3 would be a gene with a well understood role in allergic responses but that is not what we found
2018204 this is a large study involving doctors and scientists from many countries and we are confident that we have discovered something new and exciting about childhood asthma
2018205 these novel findings do not explain completely how asthma is caused but they do provide a further part of the gene environment jigsaw that makes up the disease we and our colleagues are currently preparing even bigger studies to find other genes of smaller effect and to relate these to environmental factors that increase asthma risk
2018206 look theres a scary person outside let me take a shower

2018210 the present study in a representative sample of older adults strengthens the findings in some previous studies among middle aged individuals of a beneficial effect of moderate or heavy coffee consumption on the risk of death
2018211 we expect results from more detailed studies in larger study populations to provide more insight about the advantages and disadvantages of coffee consumption and to set critical recommendations of optimal consumption with regard to health

2018213 the governments attempts to close the widening gap between rich and poor have failed these figures highlight yet again that children from less well off backgrounds do not get the same opportunities as others
2018214 we urgently need to address the widening gap between rich and poor we want to allow good new schools to set up in poor areas based on the successful swedish model so that every parent gets the opportunity for their child that is currently only open to the rich
2018215 the tory claims are not accurate it is a manipulation of figures anyone who works in education knows that as a result of investment sixfold in real terms in school buildings for example things have improved most significantly for those who need it the tories arent coming forward with credible policies
2018216 i simply cant see that the swedish style free market model is going to make the difference that they say
2018217 there would have been a trail contamination all over the place

2018221 if someone is trying to sell photos of britney in cabo theyre doing so without her knowledge or permission
2018222 the picts have always been an attractive lost people they are one of the most interesting lost peoples of europe
2018223 the big question is what happened to them and did they ever really make a kingdom of their own
2018224 they would have been dreaming of a new rome and a new world connected by water rather than roman roads
2018225 they were the most extraordinary artists they could draw a wolf a salmon an eagle on a piece of stone with a single line and produce a beautiful naturalistic drawing nothing as good as this is found between portmahomack and rome even the anglo saxons didnt do stone carving as well as the picts did not until the post renaissance were people able to get across the character of animals just like that
2018226 the most important piece had a latin inscription thats as common as muck in the mediterranean but extremely rare in scotland
2018227 it says this is the cross of christ in memory of reo and the rest is broken away unfortunately the key bit the name of the person is missing it means theres someone around there who knows how to write in the eighth century that itself is a revelation
2018228 a startling symmetry offering us more than just competence in construction
2018229 the golden section together with its inverse the golden number 1 618 has been valued by artists for millennia and it is a true delight to observe it among their architects
2018230 it shows the importance of symbol and worship in everything done in the service of the christian god
2018231 there is something rather intriguing in the learnt character of them this is a building put up to house metal workers its the idea they were all possessed of the same kind of knowledge and all trying to serve it
2018232 this is staggering to hear but im not totally surprised i think they were pretty sophisticated when you think of all the pictish stones and the wonderful carvings that they made a lot more sophisticated than perhaps they are given credit for in public perception
2018233 there was a war as important as alfreds against the danes in england and the picts got really battered in the annals of ulster there are records of battles where the flower of pictish aristocracy is killed
2018234 portmahomack got burnt down pretty definitively round about 820 the idea is they were under new masters it could be the norse or the men of moray macbeth and his family i think portmahomack was captured by the men of moray the norse wanted it badly but they didnt get it there is no norse material there there was no more vellum making and sculpture and it stopped being a monastery in the ninth to 11th centuries they are making metal work but thats the real dark age
2018235 and then contador peeled his banana and stuck it in riccos face like this
2018236 you owe it to yourself to your family to your country to keep it together four more days
2018237 its not nice air here but no city is you cant tell if its humidity or smog or what i dont know if you have to go really hard for it to hurt you or whether you would feel it after two weeks or whether it is a bunch of hype
2018238 one would hope that at least there is a proper field investigation going on

2018268 thanks to rising oil prices iraq will enjoy a 79 billion surplus by the end of the year according to a report requested by a bipartisan group of senators while the us has spent 48 billion in american taxpayer money on iraqs reconstruction since 2005 iraq has spent only a fraction of its oil revenue on reconstruction projects and iraq spent only 1 percent of its 2005 2007 budget to maintain existing projects already funded by americans or iraqis thus preinvasion promises that iraqi oil money would finance the rebuilding of iraq have gone unfulfilled

2018274 jeg tror ikke at man rent konomisk kan sige at det her har den helt store betydning
2018275 i bund og grund er danmark jo allerede et euro medlem vi vil m ske opleve et lavere renteniveau i den korte ende plus at vi selvf lgelig slet ikke vil have udsving i kronen hvilket kan give en form for stabilitet men den helt store konomiske gevinst er der nok ikke
2018276 de finansielle markeder er jo ikke ligefrem kendetegnet ved stabilitet for tiden og vi har m ske ikke behov for noget der udstiller danmark p det globale verdenskort

2018280 its clear that they have no evidence against me they are simply trying to intimidate me because of my political views
2018281 summoning for investigation people whose political or public activity it does not like
2018282 during the investigation they wanted to make clear that they knew everything about me including personal stuff and that there was nothing i could do without them finding out they suggested i could end up in prison forgotten about if they desired it
2018283 elements in israel are liable to be exploited for hostile aims including recruitment to hizbollah or other illegal activity
2018284 karmi told me he had a list of people who had once been quiet but who were now politically active because of me
2018285 then he said he was concerned for my welfare and that i might lose my reputation if i carried on working with the party
2018286 these investigations are about intimidating our members and destroying our party not because we are any kind of a security threat but because the shin bet fears the success of our political programme
2018287 they want the countrys palestinian voters to think of us as extremists and militants so they will be afraid to be associated with us and they want israeli jews to believe we are threatening democracy so that they will agree to harsher treatment against us

2018291 the preservation of the jewish character of the state is not one of the purposes and functions of the shin bet
2018292 even if what they are doing is completely unrelated to the security of the state
2018293 a discernible effect on the content of the political discourse and public agenda of the arab sector
2018294 the shin bet have been gunning for azmi for years with little success because they have no evidence against him they could not discredit his political ideas so they decided to threaten him with a security case in which they do not need to present their evidence in public

2018316 how could the negotiations be lapsed if it is still on the table and if anthony adams claimed
2018317 sutts said he still has authority to continue speaking with detroit officials

2018320 scandal plagued detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick came to windsor for a secret meeting wednesday to reassure city officials he wants to move forward with a controversial tunnel agreement
2018321 the deal is not dead despite what we may have heard
2018322 i suppose he could have picked up the phone but he realized by coming over it makes an impression he really wants the deal going to the trouble of coming over makes you believe they are serious
2018323 the distractions of detroits council have left the situation so uncertain windsors council does not want to proceed and incur further legal expense unless detroit clarifies its position
2018324 we could proceed with negotiations reach completed documents and detroits council could reject it for reasons totally unrelated to the documents themselves windsors council has decided they dont want to incur expenses on a speculative basis
2018325 finalizing operating agreements among these groups so that they can operate fairly flexibly
2018326 we have the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today

2018336 the scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
2018337 the challenge we face now is how to translate advances made in our understanding of the virus and the human immune responses to it into promising vaccine candidates as quickly and safely as possible
2018338 developing a preventive hiv aids vaccine is going to be much tougher than we originally thought
2018339 the world is now relying on the talents resources and energy of researchers doctors policy makers activists and other stakeholders from both the developed and the developing world

2018382 a lot of what mi tierra has right now the pi atas and the garlands he started
2018383 he was always decorating it was a way of bringing out his culture and expressing himself

2018410 the industry is very anxious that unfavorable facts dont get out there one tactic is to tar any critic as irrational
2018411 its really tough to get our viewpoints represented in the media

2018433 when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core

2018570 weve seen a lot of the commodity based currencies suffer during this period of the sharp reverse of fortunes in the price of many sensitive commodity prices mainly oil and natural gas
2018571 at least for the time being are reassessing their views of the global economy and that the slowdown in the u s is now taking more and more victims along with it
2018572 are increasingly not only americas largest trading partners close to home canada in particular but also the developed world such as europe
2018573 more and more investors are coming to the conclusion that this could be a much more protracted economic downturn than had originally been thought
2018574 the views that oil prices could only go onwards and upwards have been obviously turned around on expectations now that softer growth will result in some reduction in demand for commodities
2018575 at least temporarily this is a commodity play our currency is viewed as a proxy for commodity prices and oil is the bellwether here
2018576 sure not many people are going to be weeping about it maybe a lot of importers and cross border shoppers are sort of crying today

2018591 one of those rules is this do not provide ammunition to the opposition party that can be used to destroy your partys nominee this is a hyper truth where the presidential contest is concerned
2018592 it was mccain who used his influence in the senate to help foreign owned dhl buy a u s company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in ohio
2018593 in 2003 davis lobbied the senate to accept the proposal by dhl to buy airborne express for 1 05 billion airborne express at the time ran the airport and package sorting facility in wilmington
2018594 several wilmington civic leaders said that what happened in 2003 created an economic gain for their community lasting several years
2018595 those jobs are on the chopping block because sen mccain and his campaign were involved in a deal that resulted in control of those positions being shifted to a foreign corporation and theres no getting around that
2018596 you want more job losses and more of the same then vote for mccain
2018597 would an american company really have acted any differently if it found a way to cut cost to keep steady or increase profit

2018601 ive never been able to get the hang of american optimism i guess the tendency towards dark thoughts seems to run in russian blood somehow whenever i feel lonely or lost or confused or hopeless or agitated for no reason i can find the only thing that makes everything go away is yankas music somehow the simple act of sitting down with a guitar and breaking the silence of a room with these songs feels like a kind of religious experience like a confession or a prayer

2018606 is that the acceleration of the universe is forcing the gravity wells to be less strong so over the time it takes for energy to cross the cluster the strength of the cluster has diminished
2018607 we are pleased to announce the removal of the conditions to close our second asset deal the sale of our land and building to discovery parks a unique organization that is dedicated to furthering research in the biotech and technology industries
2018608 this event brings us one step closer to completing the sale of another non core asset in connection with our strategic corporate restructuring we continue to work towards divesting the remainder of our non core assets including atrigel and eligard to further increase shareholder value

2018622 ive never said that i think their version of my song is disgusting as one paper reported i dont sit in judgment over them theyve pleased an awful lot of people with that disc
2018623 its a good clean version which has been heard by a great many people our version did not sell here god knows why it went to no 1 in the us but the bachelors have been able to communicate my lyric to people who may never have heard it otherwise
2018624 in criticism all i can say is that i think it strange that the bachelors should choose to record a very hip song when their style is so conflicting i feel that some artists never get as much out of a song as i have put into it
2018625 changes in my lyrics upset me some the hollies for example who im delighted to hear are interested in i am a rock have had to cut out the word womb from one line in case it gets banned by the bbc or someone
2018626 anyone would think there was something dirty about the word i never wrote a dirty lyric in my life

2018641 the agency recognizes that a number of factors have contributed to high corn food and fuel prices as a nation
2018642 is strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americans farming communities
2018643 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2018644 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind
2018645 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2018646 so that is going to be a key element for the future
2018647 would have sabotaged the development and growth of new technologies and a cellulosic biofuels industry

2018660 the economy did not appear to worsen at least in its effect on our business
2018661 assumes a continued challenging economy during the second half of the year
2018662 we have seen much greater caution on behalf of many small business owners managers such that decisions to switch service providers are taking perhaps twice as long as just a few months ago
2018663 service providers and msps serving the smaller end of the smb market have seen elongated decision making cycles perhaps as a result of the it manager at these firms the owner being fully engaged in driving sales rather than new it capabilities
2018664 this is ridiculous as is health minister david cunliffes claim to have no influence over pharmacs decision ministers can move heaven and earth at a rapid pace when they need to avoid political embarrassment
2018665 the 12 month course of herceptin is already funded in 33 countries around the world such decisions are always financially motivated
2018666 the only way to solve this is a change not just of government but of direction
2018667 in addition to radon nkba certified designers are familiar with many other health concerns in kitchen and bath remodels that most consumers have never considered
2018668 when ms karen hughes was appointed as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners
2018669 why should the state department spend u s taxpayer dollars to work with islamists who actively oppose the foreign policy goals of the united states and subscribe to a supremacist oppressive ideology

2018671 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2018672 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2018673 and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core
2018674 with each of these charges they are mandatory sentence of life imprisonment very severe charges the most severe that we have in wisconsin the most severe punishment we have in wisconsin
2018675 those will be attempted homicide charges and a sexual assault charge
2018676 theres absolutely no possibility hes going to make a million dollars or even 10 000 so i just thought it was more than reasonable
2018677 hes pretty kind of overwhelmed by the whole series of events i mean hes not somebody whos accustomed to the criminal justice system
2018678 its my job to fight for them so thats where im at emotionally this is my job this is what i do i have to do it well
2018679 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
2018680 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
2018681 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
2018682 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
2018683 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
2018684 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
2018685 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
2018686 honey why is there a de motivational poster above the fireplace

2018690 what is not true is that i was denied access to this material because i didnt pursue it i may have left it open with them but it was not especially compelling not compelling enough to waste my staffs time to go looking for it
2018691 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2018692 i would hope now they the fbi can see they were in the wrong and weve been right from the beginning
2018693 i hope they will stand there and admit it was their fault and make some kind of settlement
2018694 one of the people that worked at the laboratory told me they had better security at a 7 11 than they did at the laboratory where they had the most dangerous substances known to mankind
2018695 he was not just a little bit weird i mean he was certifiable
2018696 if you say that because you are born with a certain inclination then it is god given and you should be free to follow that through in your life it doesnt make any logical sense whatever
2018697 you would then have to say that there are many different inclinations with which people are born
2018698 the fact that you are born with it doesnt make any moral judgement on the inclination people fight to subdue inherently bad tempers depressive streaks or lots of sexual inclinations some inclinations are good some are not good and some are mixed
2018699 if such comes to be shown it will be necessary to acknowledge the full implications of that new aspect of the truth and that insight applied to establish and acknowledge what may be a new status for homosexual relationships within the church
2018700 i stood at the front gate of a cathedral in america last month and read a notice saying anybody going on the lgbt parade come to the cathedral first and have your relationship blessed by the bishop he said

2018705 i think honestly that im better than he is in every single aspect of the game
2018706 i just have a very stubborn attitude where i wont allow myself to fail
2018707 its my turn to start my legacy and my reign
2018708 he fitch has good cardio he trains hard but hes built to go medium for a long period of time so he can keep going at a good pace for a very long time but he cant go at a very very high pace for a long time georges has more power more athletic ability so georges can go explode and then recover explode and recover fitch is like strong steady just plodding along basically what he does is he wears you out over time georges is explosive
2018709 every time i talk to fitch and his camp theyre very confident they can beat gsp
2018710 he thinks people dont realize how tough he is until they fight him hes going to get in there hes going to outwork gsp and grind out a win
2018711 when i talk to people about how they feel about gsp basically what people think is gsp eats wrestlers alive chews them up and spits them out and that has been his track record and he seems very mentally there very strong mentally on top of his game
2018712 im not really that good of a wrestler im a good fighter but to stereotype me as a wrestler is foolish a little bit so i hope hes considering me just a wrestler because then hes in for a rude awakening on saturday night
2018713 the way i explain it to people is if brazilian jiu jitsu was a banana split then guerilla jiu jitsu is a banana split with whipped cream on top hot fudge nuts and a cherry
2018714 jon fitch hes like a new breed of mixed martial arts fighter hes not like the old school guys of course hes a great wrestler thats his first background but hes very good standing up and on the ground as well so he brings a lot more problems to the table than the other guys ive fought in the past im going to have to use a lot more tools than ive been using in the past but i truly believe that fighting wrestlers is my speciality thats the type of people that im the best to fight when i fight wrestlers i always do very well
2018715 the top level guys the guys that are at the top are professionals or behaving as professionals the guys who talk trash and the guys who spew all that garbage they dont last they do that stuff because they need that to get attention because they suck as fighters
2018716 i think jon fitch poses a whole bunch of problems for georges st pierre
2018717 he does a lot of things well that georges does well hes a solid wrestler hes really great at scrambling he has good standup and he has good submissions so theres no one area where i really feel that georges can go out there and exploit jon fitch i think its just going to boil down to who has the better fight on that night
2018718 jon fitch is no pushover at all i think some people are writing him off but jon fitch i tell you he does everything that gsp can do i just think gsp may just have an edge kind of everywhere
2018719 youve got a guy whos a little more polished in robinson like georges youve got a guy thats beating everybody like lamotta did
2018720 i dont know how much im allowed to say but im a very bad person
2018721 would have killed me if i hadnt done it because hes such a terminator fan
2018722 never been in this kind of big popcorn action movie a male one an action one
2018723 i still dont know how it will play out with this one they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie
2018724 i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be

2018728 events will certainly become more frequent in a warmer climate
2018729 the investment argument is fast becoming too compelling to ignore not only do rare stamps and historical signatures provide a means of diversification and a safe haven in difficult economic conditions but also provide a hedge against inflation
2018730 current performance within the market for rare stamps and historical signatures demonstrates an absence of recession fears
2018731 in fact it has proved contra cyclical to trends elsewhere in the world market
2018732 ive got to get some really hard painful couches for my place
2018733 you come over my house youre taking your pants off and putting on sweats then jumping into bed and watching tv or playing battleship or something but the person who overstays his welcome and wants to sleep over they get the bad couch

2018740 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2018741 they do not bind the commission we must wait for the end of the process and the commissions recommendations
2018742 the fact that 16 titles out of the 29 that have received a favorable opinion have been obtained in clear violation of the 2002 moratorium is completely incomprehensible
2018743 well first i woke up then i had a piece of toast
2018744 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
2018745 the weapons from the earlier case as well as the nature of the carjacking in and of itself are very serious matters
2018746 we take it seriously and we articulated in court why we thought that there should be either no bond or very high bond
2018747 obamas political calculation may be correct but it still involves a price it has shattered his claim to be different it calls into question his political character and leaves the impression he is consumed and defined by ambition
2018748 bionomics has a great team of experienced and highly motivated people focused on its success we have a number of important milestones ahead which will continue to define bionomics as a rising star and i feel privileged to continue at the helm
2018749 as the tropics warm are are seeing an increased frequency in the heaviest rainfall
2018750 implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes may be underestimated
2018751 flash flooding can cause damage to settlements and societies it can contaminate ground water drinking supplies with potential health effects
2018752 the spread of disease can be impacted by heavy rainfall
2018753 very intense rainfall can destroy crops there are also possibilities of enhanced erosion degradation of soil
2018754 i will not raise taxes on the people of california period
2018755 also presented certain challenges for telus that were less than satisfactory
2018756 that can be attributed to the competitive voice pricing we are facing in the canadian market which is offsetting our strong 54 per cent growth in wireless data
2018757 despite the fact that since 2001 teluss ongoing investment in restructuring and workforce reduction totals 1 billion i am less than satisfied with the revision of our restructuring expense target from 50 million to 30 million
2018758 clearly we need to realize improved traction on our efficiency initiatives
2018759 this is key if we are to absorb the endemic challenges of the telecom industry including price commoditization new competition and dilution from new technologies
2018760 as a result of good operational execution year to date we have made upward revisions to full year 2008 revenue guidance as well as narrowing the ranges for ebitda and eps guidance while maintaining existing guidance for non spectrum capital expenditures
2018761 the safety and security of the random house building and employees
2018762 democrats work for solutions republicans pray the problem will go away
2018763 liberals got women the right to vote liberals got african americans the right to vote liberals created social security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty liberals ended segregation liberals passed the civil rights act the voting rights act liberals created medicare liberals passed the clean air act the clean water act what did conservatives do they opposed them on every one of those things every one so when you try to hurl that label at my feet liberal as if it were something to be ashamed of something dirty something to run away from it wont work senator because i will pick up that label and i will wear it as a badge of honor
2018764 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2018765 if it matters at your house it matters in the white house
2018766 i dont think anybody would be comfortable with that this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to
2018767 at the end of the day though i think all parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation this is a high risk business this is the national football league we understand that when we sign on
2018768 when the trade papers actually came and i was going to sign it which would be my job i almost wanted someone else to sign it
2018769 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot id love to see him have the time of his life im wishing him well that he does well
2018770 it wasnt bretts fault and it wasnt our fault but the relationship got to a point where it couldnt go forward dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens neither party is at fault but you move forward and i think mikes right we want to have a long term relationship with brett and i think he does too i think thats important to him
2018771 i dont have all the answers to know what we couldve done to do this better
2018772 every decision weve made thats been in the background does this make us a better organization in the long run
2018773 these next five races are win at all costs just get the wins get the bonus points
2018774 our team is really in a position right now where we dont have to worry too much about having a bad race but for a lot of the teams at the tail end of the chase field this tracks really important
2018775 you can have such a bad day here through a small mistake that this will be a little bit of a bottleneck for a lot of guys theres a lot of pressure this is really nice to come here without that pressure because i know how that feels
2018776 you have a private key that corresponds to this certificate
2018777 there is no room for waste abuse or fraud in this government
2018778 we want to send a message to our employees that we not only encourage them but we expect them to step forward if they see something is wrong we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the misuse of public money resources or property
2018779 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2018780 knowledge intensive services business financial and communications instead of science
2018781 this is an area of concern for us and we are looking to getting people on the ground quickly
2018782 the un is working quite closely with the government of northern bar el ghazal which has set up a crisis management committee
2018783 assessments are underway as well as an initial response to supply food non food items kitchen sets sleeping mats and mosquito nets to help support those displaced by the floods
2018784 until the situation in abyei is resolved with a full withdrawal of all forces the establishment of a joint police force an integrated unit on the military side and an interim administration it is unlikely that there will be a major movement of people back
2018785 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2018786 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2018787 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2018788 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2018789 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2018790 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2018791 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2018792 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2018793 right wing extremism is part of everyday life and only attracts attention when the crimes are especially horrific
2018794 these are crimes that pose a threat to public safety and that could lead to people getting killed
2018795 significantly more likely to commit acts of violence against political rivals and the police
2018796 it is what it is i am a member of the jets im excited about the opportunity
2018797 in my opinion are over and done with wish them well ill use their term were moving forward
2018798 when this opportunity presented itself we felt we were getting a good player at quarterback position
2018799 we did a voluminous amount of research on brett not only as a player but as a person
2018800 i think my interest at first we all know was to stay within our division maybe that was a little vindictive nature competitive nature whatever i think in the end that was probably the wrong move and i realized that was not going to happen
2018801 a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2018802 i think once these guys know me theyll like me know ill do whatever it takes to win for them
2018803 after today and tomorrow i hope that the distractions are at a minimum its ok to have attention as long as its on this team im one man one of 53 well see what happens im excited about the opportunity
2018804 you really think that a professional organization is going to hire you if you cant spell
2018805 im satisfied this was a deliberate attempt by mr mellin to kill himself
2018806 andrew stockdale myles heskett and chris ross will make no public statements at this time except to say that they are each really looking forward to making their new music over the years ahead
2018807 in the meantime they simply ask all wolfmother fans to please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has lead to the decisions announced today
2018808 we are trying to do more innovative things to deal with the increases and hopefully make fewer budget cuts
2018809 there are some great lan events hosted around the world each year here
2018810 now the world will watch and remember what we do here
2018811 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
2018812 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
2018813 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2018814 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2018815 your response to the news of pat fords attorney saying the review has been terminated there wont be an investigation and that pat ford he says is exonerated
2018816 well the reaction to that is that i still have a lot of questions out there as to what is going on in the city i dont know what they looked at i dont know who they spoke to but it is what it is at this point as far as any comments on my take on all this or political grandstanding theres a couple of inconvenient facts in the way number one the city solicitors opinion made it very clear that mr ford was absolutely wrong in his analysis of what that billboards about it is not a minor change the city solicitor made it clear that mr ford had previously done these lamar deals and as youll recall that those were not legal actions then and the word that he used was prospectively meaning going forward that we shouldnt do these things those are the facts
2018817 and whether there was influence peddling or not its really down to the issue of are we abiding by the city zoning code and the answer was no and its as simple as that and all the other matters that came mr fords way were not of my making but were of his own making and putting himself in a position where there was a question of his integrity there was a question on the table of whos influencing whom and actions that were taken by the zoning administrator and others at the direction of the ura director was improper as far as im concerned theres no way that the ura director should be directing the department of planning those are facts those are all established facts and i dont see it as any grandstanding on when youve got a fact matter out there with regard to abiding by the law
2018818 so youre saying that apart from the matter about personal gifts youre saying that his role in the way the billboard matter went forward raises questions
2018819 well one things absolutely clear during the six hour post agenda the facts or so called facts that mr ford was asserting to the council were incorrect thats a fact i dont understand you know this is part of the problem with government today generally whether its in the congress or the state house or at the local level it seems that theres a wink and a nod system out there that were going to let things slide that it doesnt really matter and nobody wants to go and read the law and understand how to run a city theres a certain amount of arrogance on the part of governmental official about what they should be doing and what they actually do and i would consider all of this matter part of that whole scene that we see in pennsylvania today
2018820 finally his lawyer said that theyve notified the ura that pat ford intends to request a return to work is it appropriate for him to return
2018821 thats a decision between the ura board i will say this that i think despite the finding of the ethics commission i think that the relationships between the council and others that deal with the ura this is clouded by this and i dont know how productive that is if mr ford wants to take the position of being okay i did something wrong i e interpreted the zoning code wrong then it should be admitted and apologized for there and move on but if its going to be an acrimonious relationship if its going to be personal battles and so forth then the value of his being in that office is diminished
2018822 the lamar billboards going to be the zoning board of adjustment in early september i think the 4th or the 7th something like that and my interpretation of the code is that they dont have the use exception available to them under the code and then well see what happens there and then people can judge for themselves as to the veracity of what those of us on council objected to in the process of putting that board up theres a no bid contract at the parking authority mr ford was the chair there was a sign off at administrative review that was incorrect as said by the city law department all these things came to a head they were not of my making they were presented to me and i acted accordingly im here to basically mind the public purse and mind the public trust
2018823 theres an old saying once you reach the limit of your logical argument then you resort to name calling
2018824 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
2018825 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
2018826 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2018827 out and was in the process of doing so when gibson arrived
2018828 it would have been nasty if the ump didnt get in my way gedman told me referring to the collision with gibson

2018840 once youve had a blu ray you never go back

2018848 american idol as usual wright offered smiles handshakes and pleasant chit chat
2018849 its tough when a man loses his glasses manuel said
2018850 its more a hindrance than major flaw at this point
2018851 it was the most startling thing ive ever seen in my life
2018852 it was just after dark and we were watching marcus welby md
2018853 gary had only been gone for a minute when he came running back up the stairs white as a sheet and pointed to something just two doors up on the opposite side of the street
2018854 and there was this round ufo with very bright lights
2018855 we rang the police and they came out to investigate but would only talk to gary even though we all saw it
2018856 people just look at me if i tell them about it
2018857 but i dont care i know what we saw that night
2018858 would you like some jelly with your toast then youll have some fun selecting your flavors from the kaleidoscopic presentation all homemeade

2018867 the board of supervisors recognizes the common roots youth organizing program for their successful efforts to develop a community of youth activists by bringing together latino and chinese immigrant youth building their skills and capacity for organizing around common issues with a common voice
2018868 88 percent of the people who live by the freeway are people of color
2018869 english is not the top language spoken in our communities
2018870 they are all people of color and share the same neighborhood
2018871 it was staggering it was like being at a rock concert every day we shot
2018872 i have celebrated my greatest racing moments wearing napa colors and we have enjoyed some wonderful on track and commercial success
2018873 both of my daytona 500 wins were with napa the launch of my own race team was with napa we have been together so long its hard to think of one without the other
2018874 the bond we have forged has helped us sell a lot of auto parts through the years and we are pleased to have michael represent us again in 2009
2018875 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 percent everywhere
2018876 but if you look at individual countries and if you look at the percent that have achieved universal coverage or will be close to universal coverage there may be much more than you may think of
2018877 what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others not
2018878 if you are in the lower tranche of middle income countries you would contribute lets say 30 percent and the global fund would contribute 70 percent if you are in the upper tranche of middle income countries the global fund would contribute 30 percent and you would contribute 70 percent
2018879 i think this opens the door to china and one day maybe india but at least to those countries that are generating so much wealth
2018880 its a matter of political choices in terms of allocation of resources if these countries do that then the money from the global fund and international donors can concentrate on the poorest countries
2018881 theres a lot of families that are going to be out of a job and this whole community is going to suffer because of because of their greed

2018890 statement from cecile richards president of planned parenthood federation of america responding to a new york times story that the bush administration is considering a new hhs rule that would compromise womens access to health care and information
2018891 planned parenthood is gravely concerned that the bush administration is days away from an attack on womens health care that would limit the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
2018892 this proposed rule will put womens access to birth control and the information they need to make health care decisions at risk
2018893 as one of the leading womens health care providers and advocates planned parenthood will not stand by and watch the bush administration deny quality affordable health care and accurate information to millions of women
2018894 the bush administration wants to require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control

2018898 its what i call a protection racket the companies are charging you a fee and theyre making a promise that its going to improve your credit and protect against identity theft but in fact it does neither
2018899 the sites are designed to trick people into taking on overpriced useless credit monitoring and they do so by attempting to make it appear as if youre going to get something for free
2018900 its not the one by the government which is why we put the link on our front page of the landing site and it is a free report its really a test drive for people to understand whats in that report because a report can be very complex

2018911 the tracks at watkins glen and sonoma are comparable in the same way as pocono and indy are comparable
2018912 the tracks are different but the same for people like me who dont have road course experience i think there are similarities because the driving style is very similar in some ways technically there is not a lot of information we use from one race to the other but from a driving standpoint its the same
2018913 discovered that 48 percent of all voters and tellingly 51 percent of independents feel they have been hearing too much about barack obama in contrast only 10 percent of voters say they have been hearing too little about the de facto democratic nominee
2018914 there may be a surfboard analogy here as well no one can ride a wave forever obama has bestrode the news cycle like a colossus since he entered the presidential race a year and a half ago whenever he hit low points like the rev jeremiah wright debacle obamas instinctive response was to deliver a stirring speech but there comes in politics a moment where what was once exhilarating a presidential nominee who is the hopeful embodiment of 21st century america becomes predictable and commonplace
2018915 keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2018916 ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country

2018918 im sorry to see he left green bay i like the packers and i like brett favre but im more sorry that he came out of retirement because he took the magic of it all away
2018919 the non football part of it and the relationship between the player and the franchise that would have continued after his career is probably irretrievably damaged and thats really sad
2018920 its disheartening to see him go and play especially for the new york jets but the packers have to move on

2018923 we are pledging 1 million to fund projects that will improve marketing productivity and pig health to help achieve long term sustainability for this vital sector
2018924 our pig industry has been through very tough times recently with rising feed costs that came on top of last years foot and mouth restrictions
2018925 this package is the first of its kind in scotland for the pig sector and demonstrates the scottish governments confidence in a sector that produces a top quality product and meets the highest welfare standards
2018926 it follows a range of other measures already taken by this government to support our pig farmers
2018927 just as the report looks ahead my priority is to direct available resources strategically to projects that invest for the future
2018928 the takeover of grampian country foods by meat processing company vion has dramatically changed the shape of the pig industry
2018929 i am confident that todays announcement together with our future actions will benefit producers processors retailers and consumers and deliver sustainable economic growth in the industry for years to come i want an industry which is not only efficient and productive but world renowned for its quality

2018942 we must create communications that people want to seek out rather than screen out we still operate by pushing messages out to consumers rather than pulling them toward great ideas
2018943 if brand development was simple you could create brands with two accountants and two lawyers working together that obviously isnt going to happen

2018949 an outspoken critic of what he sees as the islands tendency to brush awkward problems under the carpet
2018950 it is tempting to use the islands tax haven status as a metaphor for the locals ability to keep even the shadowiest of secrets

2018952 we saw a series of video and social networking sites exhibit much more modest traffic growth than they had been

2018965 there is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the framers intended to build the wall of separation between church and state it is a metaphor based on bad history a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging it should be frankly and explicitly abandoned
2018966 whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the province of almighty god to obey his will to be grateful for his benefits and humbly implore his protection and favor
2018967 stop lossed gis could get 1 500 extra each month
2018968 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
2018969 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
2018970 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law
2018971 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2018972 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2018973 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2018974 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2018975 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2018976 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2018977 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2018978 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2018979 the first pictures i saw of him when he didnt have any glasses on didnt look anything like him
2018980 but the pictures after he was apprehended with the glasses those look just like him
2018981 we have been informed about the case by the u s authorities and we are checking possible connections to germany at the moment
2018982 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2018983 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2018984 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2018985 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
2018986 he claimed to be a german student and i think he had already finished
2018987 we just figured out everything was not what it was
2018988 hes not in the yearbook theres no record of him theres no footprint of him but he was there
2018989 its not unusual that perpetrators or suspects try to hide stuff in the cruisers before they go to booking where they know theyll be searched
2018990 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2018991 four people have been treated here with light wounds they have already gone home
2018992 the natural response to this approach is to say that any equality based reading of the clause is redundant because the equal protection clause provides the necessary ground and more
2018993 the only valid censorship of ideas is the right of people not to listen
2018994 the proclamation removes all obstacles that were impediments to the operation of the media in ethiopia
2018995 one stop shop online do everything photographic site a veritable swiss army knife of a site ephotozine has everything a photographer could wish for
2018996 im delighted to be a judge for the rspcas young photographer awards 2008 and am looking forward to seeing lots of creative and interesting images from fantastic young talent i never travel anywhere without my camera you never know when a terrific photo opportunity will present itself and you dont want to miss that all important award winning shot
2018997 i am delighted to be invited to join the judging panel and i am looking forward to seeing the work of emerging young photographers
2018998 ive had a sneaky peak at some of the entries and know that this is going to be a fab year for ypa
2018999 when choosing to host servers offshore a key part of the decision making process has to be guaranteeing adequate security both physically and within the software environment by integrating a security package into a dedicated server plan we demonstrate our commitment to making the entire process easier for our clients to manage
2019000 we couldve had a busy street we couldve had pedestrians injured so in that light we are fortunate
2019001 we get a lot of our cranes third party inspected so we have another set of eyes coming down and inspecting our job making sure what were doing is 100 percent safe
2019002 ill probably keep looking up at the sky when im walking now
2019003 that which does not kill my career can probably fatten my paycheck a little more
2019004 8 is considered to be in the chinese culture this might explain the reason that the is set to start on the 8th day of the 8th month of the year 2008 at 8 08 local time
2019005 this study suggests that neither a low fat dietary pattern nor a typical low carbohydrate dietary pattern is ideal with regards to risk of chd both have similar risks however if a diet moderately lower in carbohydrates is followed with a focus on vegetable sources of fat and protein there may be a benefit for heart disease
2019006 this study doesnt mean that you should load your plate with steak and bacon
2019007 one likely explanation that we did not see increased risk of chd with low carbohydrate diets is that the adverse effects of animal products might be counterbalanced by reducing refined carbohydrates the quality of fat and carbohydrate is more important than quantity a heart healthy diet should embrace healthy types of fat and carbohydrates
2019008 researchers find only vegetarian low carb diet is associated with lower risk of heart disease
2019009 only vegetarian low carb diet associated with lower risk of heart disease
2019010 the questionable role of saturated and polyunsaturated fastty acids in cardiovascular disease
2019011 we are the connection between the clubs and the fans they deserve to know the full extent
2019012 in seven years on the yankees beat i have learned to be skeptical with official information on injuries
2019013 chamberlain is the franchise as one person put it to me bluntly
2019014 tabs are 8 characters and thus indentations are also 8 characters there are heretic movements that try to make
2019015 the west is provoking a new cold war with russia
2019016 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
2019017 the forestry ministry is currently part of the deforestation problem the ministry as the state agency tasked with protecting the forests is in fact promoting forest destruction
2019018 this has to stop now to arrest our greenhouse gas emissions and to ensure protection of our biodiversity for future generations
2019019 the is a clear case of the illegal land banking practice of purchasing land with the intent to hold onto it until such a time as it is highly profitable to sell it on to others
2019020 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
2019021 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
2019022 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
2019023 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
2019024 my dog sits near the computer while i do the work for him
2019025 my friend greg asimakoupoulos communicates timeless truths through timely rhymes his little poems pay big dividends in wit insight and inspiration
2019026 rarely does a game go by without my pastor and friend greg asimakoupoulos penning a poem that captures what occurred on the field in a fun and creative way it always brings a smile to my face when i read his weekly rhymes and reasons
2019027 democrats work for solutions republicans pray the problem will go away
2019028 obviously the old car having so much more downforce the motors having a lot less horsepower thats just quite a different animal at a place like chicago where we were at a month or so ago
2019029 a place like this its laps it doesnt matter if youre driving a dump truck around there
2019030 laps on a road course and being familiarized with the surroundings and everything and all the aspects of road racing especially for a driver like me that grew up racing motorcross is important
2019031 i didnt race go karts on road courses and things like my teammate kevin harvick did
2019032 and having good teammates like kevin hes an experienced road racer hes a proven winner hes won here before hes been at road atlanta testing and doing those things for me
2019033 you hope that it doesnt come down to racing him or him putting me out or me putting him out i hope all three of us richard childress racing drivers including jeff burton are in it
2019034 were only what 80 some points out of seventh place nine points out of 13th
2019035 people are hacking internet explorer every day and if i did the same thing on ie people would just say its just another ie vulnerability
2019036 people say that its firefox its not supposed to be as bad and its supposed to be safer and more secure so i took it as a challenge
2019037 the basic thing that jinx implements is that it will download files from your computer and send it to a remote web site
2019038 i got bored with it so i made it into a bot and interactive so i can manage multiple jinx instances
2019039 we end up having a complete framework all in javascript in the browser without code injection or virtualization its just you firefox and us
2019040 i would say that if i would have the target and the time im pretty sure its portable and that this could work on any other browser that has ajax support
2019041 theyve got millions of users and are a great place to target
2019042 if youre trying to get friends really fast for a social attack its important the bigger your network the more legitimacy you have friends are currency on social networks
2019043 i have 30 years of research on different areas of architecture and design and this was a very challenging project not only in design but on the technical side
2019044 the fluidity of our design combined perfectly with the technology of the plastic of melissa injecting pieces without closures or seals
2019045 the cubs have got smart smart people here i mean theyre winning theyre doing great things ill just stay out of the way
2019046 believe it or not i can stay out of the way
2019047 right now im just a fan supporting a great organization and thats why im here
2019048 i just cant believe that someone would get so upset about a ten foot easement on the edge of their property
2019049 it is she with the flaxen hair who conquered my heart she with the gentle laughter that trips like a merry stream through glen and prairie it is she with the flaxen hair and tranquil regard with whom i hope to marry
2019050 it was the emergence of modern zionism that would set the stage for modern conflict
2019051 recognition of two states new governance for jerusalem limited right of return and generous funding of a palestinian state
2019052 irans president is a holocaust denier and refers to israel by what can only be described as the most hateful of terms
2019053 our friendship with israel by no means can be indifferent to the palestinian claim for self governance
2019054 its the parties themselves that are going to have to resolve the conflict
2019055 obviously there is some ambiguity in the un resolution 242 which is obviously not accidental which allows for some flexibility
2019056 a resolution of the conflict has to be dependent on withdrawal from the israeli west bank settlements in order for a palestinian state to be viable in cannot be a jigsaw puzzle
2019057 what is it that were going to be able to persuade israelis to do
2019058 if you say there is a universal right of return i dont think thats on its contradictory to the un actually
2019059 refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return
2019060 i dont think anyone in the world is looking for a desperate deal theres no question the conditions in gaza have deteriorated
2019061 i personally do not hold israel solely responsible for those conditions
2019062 its difficult for international leaders to go to gaza without it looking like a political move
2019063 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2019064 there are ominous signs that the earths weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth the drop in food output could begin quite soon perhaps only 10 years from now
2019065 last april in the most devastating outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded 148 twisters killed more than 300 people and caused half a billion dollars worth of damage in 13 u s states
2019066 but they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century if the climatic change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear the resulting famines could be catastrophic
2019067 in africa drought continues for the sixth consecutive year adding terribly to the toll of famine victims
2019068 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth
2019069 if it continues the cooling will cause world famine world chaos and probably world war and this could all come by the year 2000
2019070 at this juncture a lot would have to happen in a hurry for him to be able to pitch for us at this level he would have to start throwing bullpens now and then his rehab probably would take him through the second week of september at this point i think it would be a long shot
2019071 previously much atherosclerosis research was focused on identifying ways to stabilise the most dangerous plaques in order to prevent them rupturing and causing myocardial infarction or stroke
2019072 our discovery means that we can now target the actual development of dangerous plaques
2019073 the time when individual genes or gene pathways were thought to explain the development of complex common diseases such as atherosclerosis is past
2019074 we now have enough tools and knowledge of system biology to take on the total complexity of these diseases
2019075 with each new case of antibiotic resistance doctors are losing ground against mycobacterium tuberculosis and other infectious diseases
2019076 this new approach fights the pathogen in a way thats different from conventional antibiotics for what may be the first time we have found compounds that only kill m tuberculosis when they are not dividing this lack of replication is a characteristic of latent bacteria which are tough to eradicate with existing antibiotics and ultimately play a huge role in the epidemics spread
2019077 that means that killing latent m tuberculosis is one of the keys to curtailing or eliminating tb as a disease
2019078 antibiotic research has typically focused on killing rapidly dividing bacteria but with antibiotic resistance rising that no longer seems like a winning strategy the long duration of treatment required for curing tb may reflect the fact that some of the bacteria remain non dividing even during clinically active disease
2019079 dlats main job is to help m tuberculosis get energy from nutrients but when the bacterium is under stress it also uses the enzyme to defend itself against oxidative damage from human immune cells such as macrophages
2019080 so we screened 15 000 compounds to find chemicals that might inhibit dlat
2019081 we believe that these dlat inhibitors probably target additional mechanisms that non dividing m tuberculosis needs to survive and we are currently investigating that possibility
2019082 we also believe that these compounds work in synergy with human immune responses and the chemical environment inside the host to kill latent bacteria
2019083 this was really a proof of principle effort to show that targeting non dividing bacteria was feasible
2019084 in recent work supported by the bill and melinda gates foundation we have since found additional compounds that appear to kill non dividing m tuberculosis selectively
2019085 as a parent a citizen and an occasional patient i worry about losing the hard fought gains weve made against infectious disease
2019086 when traditional antibiotics work treating tb pneumonia and other bacterial diseases seems routine when they dont work as is happening now with growing frequency these infections become emergencies the growing crisis of microbial resistance demands innovative new approaches we hope this work will encourage more scientists that such innovations are worth seeking
2019087 initiative and referendum is an extremely powerful reform tool in politics as it gives the people the ability to make informed decisions to directly effect and change the powers and priorities of their government
2019088 we believe that targeting dendritic cells may prove to be a promising strategy for treating conditions dependent on angiogenesis such as endometriosis and cancer
2019089 our next step would be to look for specific dendritic cell inhibitors that could have the potential to block angiogenesis in these conditions
2019090 although these results are preliminary i think its encouraging that a big part of the puzzle comes down to simple chemistry
2019091 off the bat you are eliminating a large majority of the catechins from plain green tea
2019092 we have to address this fact if we want to improve bodily absorption
2019093 if you want more out of your green tea add some citrus juice to your cup after brewing or pick a ready to drink product formulated with ascorbic acid
2019094 this next study is designed to get us past the limitations imposed by our digestive model which is really just a simple screening process that relies on preset physiology parameters
2019095 this study tells us a lot of interesting things but it raises many questions that have yet to be answered
2019096 in another nine months when the new gsm players start rolling out their services
2019097 remember that they has entered india at a time when mvnos are not legal and hence done
2019098 virgin mobile brand in india belongs to us says tata teleservices
2019099 even when you go to the fake site it has their name and profile picture right on the site so you really believe it
2019100 its affecting what is arguably the most popular service among canadian web surfers to the best of my knowledge we havent really seen a facebook virus of this magnitude yet
2019101 i dont have any specific numbers but i do expect that it will spread rapidly given the popularity of the social networks
2019102 the implicit trust built into the social circle of friends and the willingness to share information with those in the circle will only the help the social engineering attacks to succeed
2019103 what this trojan does is it tries to steal a persons online gaming credentials
2019104 what they can do with these stolen gaming accounts is sell them online
2019105 it would steal your user name and password and send it back to whoever is sending this thing out
2019106 the nationwide series a lot of times their schedule is more restrictive if they wash out on a day that is a companion event they have to go two days to get the race in
2019107 logistics enters into it where cup has always been the next clear day which would be monday and they would always take precedence
2019108 on the nationwide side it would be a lot of fun to give it a shot like they did last week
2019109 obviously goodyear would like to learn a lot more about the tire before we tried that on the cup side
2019110 on the cup side if you do that its really got to be a situation where there is no other option we could probably find another option but its a great opportunity in the nationwide series to try to learn from it being the second tier series thats where a lot of things are tested and a lot of trials and tribulations happen its a good series for that
2019111 originally it was about cup running in the rain and then it got away from that we felt like we needed to do their shows on the next clear day
2019112 its been such a long time since weve been put in that position to utilize the wet tires i dont think anybody really knew what to expect
2019113 it was entertaining at montreal and i think everybody did a great job we would probably have to do some other changes to go along with it like anything well evaluate it
2019114 i liked racing in the rain i thought it was fun
2019115 it looks like we might race in a little bit of wet on saturday in nationwide which would be crazy to do that two weeks in a row add comment
2019116 im a senior ive been here five years and i have to wait
2019117 a person who he or she knew or ought to have known was pregnant
2019118 the only reason to prefer bill c 484 is to recognize the fetus itself as a victim but this makes the fetus a separate legal person in direct conflict with the rights of the pregnant woman the problem of establishing legal personhood for the fetus and its vast potential for harm to women has already been discussed in our previous statements against bill c 484
2019119 the only remaining reason to support c 484 is to give personhood to fetuses with all that this entails
2019120 conduct relating to the lawful termination of the pregnancy of the mother of the child to which the mother has consented
2019121 canadian women who choose to give birth when they are pregnant should not have to stand alone to protect the child within that they are eagerly awaiting
2019122 legislation making it a separate crime to injure or kill a foetus during an attack on the mother
2019123 its a good economic engine for the city of rialto
2019124 its doubled again to 415 hotspots mostly from west kalimantan
2019125 the air quality has been unhealthy for the last few days
2019126 when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2019127 shit what am i doing its still not too late to turn around and go back
2019128 is left for us to wrestle with it cannot harm those who do not consent but manfully resist if by the grace of jesus christ
2019129 an athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules
2019130 compared to where this district was ten to 12 years ago to where it is now is phenomenal
2019131 its nice to have more people more vendors and it brings a little more excitement to the whole event
2019132 we thought this would be a good opportunity to come down and get exposure and let people know who we are
2019133 we wanted to be among other restaurants and hopefully well feed off each other and help each other
2019134 its 90 degree weather but im getting a head start on my fall wardrobe staples
2019135 each of my photographs is my attempt to unravel the world around me to see the beauty in all things im currently inspired by vintage cameras and old photographs my childhood diary and memories late night novel reading and early morning walks along the beach
2019136 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
2019137 hes a left winger and straight away when you look at our squad you see that we only had one natural left sided player lewis neal it was a gap in our squad which was glaring when you wrote out the team in a 4 4 2 formation
2019138 ive settled in really well the other lads have been brilliant and they have helped me
2019139 this one here is more of a superspeedway atmosphere because of the speed here and the speed that you carry through the corners
2019140 theres only a couple slow corners going up through the esses is pretty fast down the backstretch is pretty fast you can keep more of a platform with your rear springs here than you need to get off the springs sonoma you need all the forward bite you can get so you try to get soft springs
2019141 that would be awesome but we dont necessarily look toward that what we look toward right now is practice and making our car the best that we can make it in order to have a fast piece so we can be a contender in the race
2019142 it could explain why so many people struggle to lose weight and suggests an entirely new direction for developing medical treatments that address the current epidemic of diabetes and obesity
2019143 people who want to fit in their jeans might someday be able to overcome their genes
2019144 this is good news for potential obesity treatments because its like a volume control instead of a light switch it can be turned up or down not just on or off
2019145 eventually of course the idea is to develop drugs to target this system but thats in the years to come
2019146 even a pound a year adds up over a lifetime
2019147 that was all last year its time to let it go weve been through that and im very confident that the guys will move on i dont really have any more comment than that this is all year old stuff and its been settled
2019148 i shot these in the spring of 2007 i was in japan for the first time in 2006 to meet the mother of my japanese wife who lives in a rural prefecture named shizuoka
2019149 i have to come back to this little town with my camera
2019150 thats what they all say please step out sir before i have to call security mmkay
2019151 nicole started flirting with will like crazy and he was loving it they were all over each other on the dance floor even kissing i dont think they noticed anyone else in the club
2019152 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2019153 the bush cheney administration continues to defy our validly issued congressional subpoenas for information relevant to the politicization of the department of justice by this white house
2019154 it will be worth what were spending if only one person gets saved
2019155 this many people got saved at a single moment in time ie at this event

2019157 the tragic price families are paying for gordon browns economic incompetence
2019158 even when the economic good times were rolling councils saw ever increased pressure on their social housing stock
2019159 now that the credit crunch is upon the country it appears that many thousands more people will be looking to councils to provide them with a permanent home as they find it either impossible to get on their housing ladder or see their home repossessed
2019160 faced with stagnant earnings rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills the weight of debt is taking its toll on the thousands of hard working families who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet
2019161 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects
2019162 with rising mortgage payments and sky high food and fuel costs it is little wonder that more and more peoples budgets have been driven to breaking point
2019163 the only people who are continuing to talk about it are the media this week
2019164 we believe the bank of england really had little option other than to keep interest rates at 5
2019165 the ever growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks elevated inflation levels and risks call for higher interest rates yet this would increase the danger of a deeper extended recession best therefore to sit tight for the time being nevertheless there could well have been a three way split in the vote again
2019166 i think we are going into recession and we are probably in one right now its not too late to stop it but we have to act right now
2019167 monetary policy has been far too tight for too long
2019168 annual inflation rates are likely to remain above levels consistent with price stability over a protracted period of time and risks to price stability in the medium term remain on the upside

2019178 using the latest whole genome association technologies we have shed light on the fundamental biological process of human memory performance
2019179 the capacity to remember is a defining feature of humans and we can now use this new understanding to develop drugs that will improve memory function
2019180 the link between kibra and memory could lead to new treatments for memory loss and possibly help improve memory in patients with memory disorders such as alzheimers disease
2019181 using sophisticated functional brain imaging techniques we showed that individuals who had a version of the gene that is related to poorer memory potential had to tax their brains harder to remember the same amount of information
2019182 researchers now have enough of the letters to read the genetic book of life with unprecedented power
2019183 were excited about the chance to identify a gene that accounts for some of variation in normal human memory and to use this information in the discovery of promising new memory enhancing treatments
2019184 this memory study is a perfect example of how the use of advanced technologies in human genetics yields fundamental discoveries
2019185 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011

2019193 it was a little bit of everything there was some good some bad but ultimately we still lost the game so thats the bad we turned the ball over some got some penalties with the young group offensively all the quarterbacks did engineer a scoring drive and thats a positive defensively there was a fourth down stop there were two of them one in the first half and one in the second half which was good we stopped them at the end to give the offense the ball back to give us a chance to win we did too many things to cause us to lose they threw the ball over our heads twice for two big plays and that will kill you
2019194 hopefully this is a sign of things to come shaun rogers is a big body but moves around well up there we were able to get some good work in there we got into the backfield and held them to short gains a couple of times i think we did well against the run and will continue to improve again this is a sign of things to come and we will keep getting better at defending the run
2019195 hopefully we have a lot more of those coming i threw it where it was supposed to go i threw it so he could anticipate it
2019196 i will have to watch the tape anytime the ball is tipped over the middle it is tough
2019197 we missed a couple of things here and there other than that we executed well the offensive line did an amazing job you cant take your hats off enough to those guys going against the starters and that pass rush we ran the ball well the credit goes to the offensive line the second string wide receivers got in sync they were able to run routes and make plays
2019198 thats a big deal for a football player first we had to take a break like that and then we had to go back and hit it it is about recharging your battery and knowing how much fun you can have
2019199 thats not filet mignon thats a platter of steaming stinking bullshit

2019201 its going to be a hassle when they close that bridge youve got to go all the way down and go all the way around i dont know where im going to end up

2019208 freddie in the second quarter wrote down the value of its subprime and alt a portfolio by 1 billion
2019209 theyve only written them down by lets say five or 6 total over the past few quarters if those were sold on the market they would get maybe 50 cents on the dollar for these securities at some point they cant delay the inevitable about having to mark these assets down to their true market value they are now holding them close to book value based on the theory that these are temporary impairments as the market continues to decline into next year it will be clear that these arent just temporary impairments then the government will not be able to allow this forbearance on recognizing losses much longer

2019214 after i began researching hud fraud in the last 1990s i would be contacted by people with experience with hud fraud they insisted the same home was being used to create ten or more mortgages that were placed into different pools they alleged that chase as the lead hud servicer and the other big banks were implementing such systems this was why we would see the same house default two three or four times in a year they claimed you needed to churn the fha mortgages through multiple defaults to generate the cash to keep all these fraudulent pools afloat i have come to believe that the allegations of mortgage collateral fraud are true not just for fha and ginnie mae at hud but across the board throughout the mortgage markets what this means is that freddie and fannie mae must be converted to essentially government debt such conversion means that investors simply dont care if the mortgages have a real lien on anything real or not at least for the meanwhile otherwise there would need to be a process by which all the defaulted mortgages can be sorted through to determine which of the mortgages are legitimate and which are not

2019223 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
2019224 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bilateral agreement governing the island
2019225 our intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities

2019244 this is a major vision of the president of israel to use water and energy as a catalyst for peace and stability
2019245 an interesting fact about white people is that they firmly believe that all of the world s problems can be solved through awareness meaning the process of making other people aware of problems and then magically someone else like the government will fix it
2019246 we believe our new strategy is sound and while any new strategy takes time to gain traction it will ultimately prove itself in the marketplace
2019247 we have improved our relationship with henry schein reorganized our domestic sales team and processes and have a new emphasis on market segmentation and corresponding product development programs many of those programs are underway and the organization is responding well cost controls continue to be strong and while we still anticipate somewhat uneven revenue growth in the near term the team has made a great deal of progress toward our goals
2019248 while overall sales grew 3 percent year over year in the second quarter waterlase sales experienced a 7 percent decline due to weaker international performance the summer months traditionally make the third quarter a more challenging one so this is an ideal time for launching our new two tiered product strategy there may be some transitional impact of these changes in the third quarter but we are confident in the long term benefits of our strategy

2019257 a number of treatments have crept into fertility clinics over the years and are now part of our usual repertoire but as with many things in infertility most of these have not been properly evaluated
2019258 almost all couples with unexplained infertility will have one or both of these treatments but neither of them is significantly more effective than telling the couple to just go home and get on with it which is a lot cheaper and more fun
2019259 these treatments are offered by virtually every district hospital up and down the country so the total costs are tremendous particularly at a time when potentially more effective treatments such as ivf arent being funded because of lack of money in the system
2019260 this has to change clinical guidelines because none of these interventions are free
2019261 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2019262 intrauterine insemination has been offered to couples with unexplained infertility for many years but if there is no benefit in doing so then we should re evaluate the clinical guidelines so that nhs money is used wisely

2019268 children are notoriously picky eaters but they enjoy many processed meats and derive essential vitamins minerals protein and amino acids to the diet
2019269 uneaten bowls of lentil artichoke stew or potato cauliflower curry two of pcrms suggested recipes contribute nothing to a childs diet
2019270 just as consumers need to eat a healthy balanced diet they need balanced information

2019279 in 1998 amnesty international considered anwar ibrahim a prisoner of conscience today there are again indications that the government is not playing by the rules in this case
2019280 we are also concerned about the safety of all the witnesses in this case particularly dr mohamed osman and we call on the government to provide adequate protection to them

2019326 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
2019327 your reaction to the word pat fords attorney saying that he has been exonerated and he wants to come back to work
2019328 well let me first say we havent officially meaning the city or the ura been notified whatsoever by the state ethics board certainly encouraged by at least mr fishers comments this morning in terms of what the state ethics commission he anticipates will say of course i know its not the right thing to do to rush to judgement before any official recommendation comes down and so well wait until we hear officially from the ethics commission and of course i think its in everybodys best interest to bring some closure to this issue and hopefully that will happen here in the very near future
2019329 my understand is the ethics commission since you werent a party to this actually that because of their legal requirements cant issue a statement to you had they indicated that they can communicate anything to you at some point
2019330 i think theyll communicate to the ura or make their findings known and that has not been done yet whether that was directly communicated to mr ford or his attorney apparently it has been but it hasnt been communicated to us and once we are made known of what the conclusions are then of course well react to it at that time but until that happens i think its in everybodys best interest to make sure that case is concluded their recommendations are brought forward and then decisions are made accordingly
2019331 what if mr fisher is correct though and he has been exonerated theyre not going to do the full investigation
2019332 well again i want to reserve judgement until i see that first and foremost but i think its in everybodys interest to bring closure to this issue and move forward and once that recommendation comes down well act accordingly if there was no wrongdoing found from the ethics commission then obviously well take that into consideration and move forward but until i see what that is i dont want to make any statements toward what might happen not knowing what the ethics commission is formally going to say
2019333 youre not willing to say whether youll bring him back as executive director even if the ethics commission
2019334 again i havent speculated for four months and despite what his attorney reported today i havent been notified directly so if in fact this is the case i would anticipate that well hear in the next couple of days and i think once that happens certainly well communicate with the ura board being that they are the board that ultimately hires and deals with these issues and certainly ill communicate with them once the judgement comes down
2019335 would you leave it to the board or would you make the call
2019336 so is it fair or accurate to say that you dont want to be locked in to saying yes hes coming back until you have information firsthand
2019337 thats very fair yes i mean i want to make sure that despite what the attorney said this morning ive been hearing rumors for two months now that a decision was coming tomorrow we have the comment that was made today and i think its encouraging and certainly hope that the ethics hearing board communicates with us directly and once they do that well act accordingly but until i have that information from the ethics commission board directly i want to reserve my judgement until then
2019338 when you say encouraging are you glad this could be the case that he has been exonerated and that theres
2019339 well sure you know of course its in everybodys interest to make sure there was no wrongdoing or nothing that was done inappropriately and so if the ethics commission drew that conclusion i think thats great news for everybody and its encouraging toward putting this issue to closure
2019340 would there be any reason other reason why he could not come back if the ethics commission says all clear
2019341 as far as i see it you know again if for example there was no wrongdoing done then the ura board would ultimately have to decide i dont see any grounds at that point for any further action but again before we say that we want to make sure we get their remarks

2019345 were already falling into this trap of either positing nuremberg style war crimes tribunals or nothing immunizing everyone from john yoo up and down but everybody says theres a lot of gray area in between that and that accountability doesnt necessarily mean nuremberg it doesnt necessarily mean nothing it means possibly a truth commission possibly appointing a special prosecutor to look at it
2019346 certainly long before we make a decision to do what stuart taylor suggested this week which was immunize everybody in advance or alternatively make a decision to trot them out before a war crimes tribunal before the whole world we should really find out what happened
2019347 we talked a lot about this notion that its bad for america that it will rip america apart if we have hearings or we have criminal trials or if we have war crimes tribunals and i think its really worse for america if we dont

2019372 its been a very nice thing to do to actually get down and resolve this
2019373 its incredible to see the work that went into digging out the ditch these people were doing something on a scale that had never ever been attempted before you see the excavated sections today and you can imagine what it was like back then it would have been absolutely amazing
2019374 when we look at the excavated area the ditch bulges outwards and appears to contract in the adjacent unexcavated area to me this suggests that rather than being originally dug as a single entity the ditch was probably dug in segments
2019375 the beautifully round regular circle that appears to surround the monument today is due to the subsequent peat growth which makes it look like a smooth circle
2019376 its difficult to know how long it took to dig
2019377 perhaps it was a gradual process perhaps over many years and involving different groups of people were the people who brought in the stones responsible for digging their own segment of the ditch if thats the case it could have taken several hundred years to build
2019378 instead dr richardss theory is that it wasnt the completed stone circle that was significant but rather the physical act of constructing it the prestige of erecting a fine megalith he suggests may have been the driving force behind the development of the monuments
2019379 my suggestion is that these communities were quite fiercely competitive the ring rather than being this harmonious temple structure that was a joint effort between different communities was maybe the site of some really quite competitive behaviour with the various groups attempting to outdo the other with visible shows of prestige and power labour and the deployment of labour was a visible mark of prestige
2019380 back in the trenches the sheer scale of the work undertaken by the prehistoric ditch diggers was clear
2019381 the great feat of labour employed in the digging of the ditch provides some insight into just how important this separation was to neolithic people
2019382 from this evidence it is quite clear that in the northern area at least standing water collected soon after the ditch was dug
2019383 but in terms of architecture the circle may not have been the most significant point in the landscape
2019384 the excavation was really more about the retrieval of samples and the subsequent results that will come after the fieldwork is complete
2019385 although the excavations 35 years ago were undertaken to obtain dating material and establish chronology they failed due to the limitations of available dating techniques at the time
2019386 bob mcculloch and his partner mary who came from stirling university to sample the sections retrieved the samples successfully and bob had some interesting observations about the ditch having filled in very rapidly and perhaps being infilled deliberately these issues will become clearer when the lab work has been done on the samples
2019387 meanwhile weve had david sanderson here from the scottish universities environment research centre suerc undertaking his sampling for dating purposes his results look promising so we could get some good dates that will allow us to put a date on when the ditch was created
2019388 in fact weve found a lot of the missing stone socket holes from this we can confirm that the circle today contains a fraction of the stones that once stood on the site

2019397 so also it could approach so close to secular society as to strive to exert a preponderant influence on it or even to exercise a theocratic power over it and so on
2019398 that the relationship of the church to the world without precluding other legitimate forms of expression can be represented better in a dialogue
2019399 dialogue is not proud it is not bitter it is not offensive its authority is intrinsic to the truth it explains to the charity it communicates to the example it proposes it is not a command it is not an imposition it is peaceful it avoids violent methods it is patient it is generous

2019410 memoirs of a book snake forty years of seeking and saving old books
2019411 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2019412 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2019413 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2019414 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2019415 absurd to try to sustain the claim that americas policies are principled while then effectively standing back and saying we will watch from the sidelines while the chinese do what they do
2019416 this speech puts together what the president has been saying for 7 1 2 years but does it in a very focused way
2019417 is one of the most important relationships that we have in the united states and the speech is being given on the eve of his trip there so he thought it was appropriate to talk about it at this point
2019418 its his choice to make as to whether or not he comes off the list
2019419 the administration has improved relations with china and strengthened the alliance with japan at the same time which is kind of gravity defying

2019569 if you had to choose one which direction would you choose north south east or west
2019570 ive thought about this and ive traveled all the directions possible to travel north
2019571 is to chose a direction that requires constant vigilance energy and commitment north requires of its travelers an oath of fidelity loyalty until the end one can try the other directions
2019572 travel them as much and as often as one likes but north requires one to swear that when lost which eventually happens even to the best of us we will always turn back to her we orientate toward her

2019655 mccain has made abundantly clear since infesting his campaign with rove prote g es a few weeks ago that he intends to run a relentlessly negative campaign for many of us it was a relief this week to see obama starting to run an occasional offense this week instead of running a prevent defense with too few players on the field what is not as clear is what the obama campaign learned from the relentlessly negative campaign hillary clinton ran against him in the last half of the primary season they clearly remember that he won but what is not so clear is whether his campaign took away anything from the fact that he lost two thirds of the primaries after hillary turned to her slash and burn strategy and that many voters came away with an uneasy feeling about him his campaign needs to understand why that happened because its the same thing that happened to al gore and john kerry its about narratives there need be no contradiction between obamas high road message and a realistic campaign that addresses all four quadrants of the message grid if he wants to retain the high road the least he can do is to counterpunch every time mccain tries to tell a story about obama or undermine obamas own story with a simple there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington from a neurological standpoint positive and emotions play different functions arise in different ways and even have largely distinct neural circuitry if mccain creates enough ambivalence about obama obama will need to create enough ambivalence about mccain to cancel it out no one has ever won an election by saying what a great guy he is letting his opponent pummel away at his character and refusing to define his opponent or derail the glorious narrative his opponent is telling about himself perhaps obama will be the first but he should study the stump speeches and convention addresses of the only democrats to win an election when republicans controlled the white house since fdr jfk in 1960 jimmy carter in 1976 and bill clinton in 1992 all three ran positive forward thinking campaigns but all three ran against the incumbent and his party with a strong story that resonated with the american people none was afraid to mince words about his opponent obama needs to remember that one of the most negative political documents ever written was the declaration of independence

2019738 the jurors taking a cue from the prosecutors feigned urgency to move a case along would skip serious careful deliberating and sign a true bill just another rubber stamp
2019739 the prosecutor and other jurors were annoyed with the questions i would fervently ask the states only witness seeking another side of the story for the accused due to this probing the prosecutors cases and charges became like the deserts shifting sand they were blowing away without probable cause left to support the charges

2019747 was not exactly re enforced to follow instructions and often floundered on what exactly their role was even a court reporter got into a jam with jurors about how they were to handle deliberations
2019748 may be challenged only on the ground that the grand jurors were not drawn or selected according to law an individual grand juror may be challenged on the ground that the juror is not qualified to sit on the grand jury or on the particular matter at hand
2019749 although i was thanked by one prosecutor for my questions to witnesses which apparently helped him nail his case shut

2019798 not to be ungrateful or anything but maybe it pays down a bill but it doesnt pay down every bill every month the short term quick fix kinda stuff sounds good and it may even feel good that first month when you get that check and then you go out and you buy a pair of earrings
2019799 i know were spending i added it up for the first time we spend between the two kids on extracurriculars outside the classroom were spending about 10 000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements and so on and so forth
2019800 now were keeping like a bowl of fresh fruit in the house but you have to go to the fruit stand a couple of times a week to keep that fruit fresh enough that a not gonna eat the pruney grape you know at that point its like eww shes not gonna eat the brown banana or the shrivelledy up things its got to be fresh for them to want it whos got time to go to the fruit stand who can afford it first of all
2019801 and the notion of trying to think about a lunch every day so you grab the lunchables right and the fruit juice box thing and we think we
2019802 i wake up every morning wondering how on earth i am going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day i know that everybody in this room is going through this that is the dilemma women face today every woman that i know regardless of race education income background political affiliation is struggling to keep her head above water
2019803 what i notice about men all men is that their order is me my family god is in there somewhere but me is first
2019804 im glad we only race on a road course twice a year
2019805 road courses are extremely challenging on both the driver and the team its definitely a challenge i enjoy but it takes a much different approach to driving and setting up the car to be successful on a road course
2019806 we prepare our cars each week to do one specific thing turn left and now we have to set up the car in a completely different way we have to drive the car in a completely different way i think its exciting for the fans and they really enjoy it and i know most of the drivers enjoy it we just go out try to have fun and of course we do our best to win
2019807 we tested at virginia international raceway last week and worked on the car to find a good balance
2019808 team director rodney childers and i worked on our setup for this week and tried a lot of new things
2019809 i try to push my dodge to the limit in each and every area of a road course once i figure out how far i can push it thats when start to put add comment
2019810 we did not reach the reporting threshold on receipts or expenditures
2019811 i have no affiliation or connection with the group but i support what theyre doing
2019812 im sure they are abiding by the rules and regulations of the state of new hampshire
2019813 how do you ensure that we have no income tax unless you limit the spending that is backing us into one
2019814 the governor has said he will veto a sales or income tax many many times managing the state budget takes leadership and the governor continues to provide that leadership
2019815 i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
2019816 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
2019817 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
2019818 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
2019819 former democratic presidential candidate mike gravel was caught on tape last week telling a crowd in washington d c that they should harass a federal prosecutor who helped bring criminal contempt charges against a palestinian activist

2019821 dead man awakens before autopsy shocks doctors by asking for glass of water
2019822 while thats the goal if it is not met then the teams first game in brooklyn would end up being calendar year 2011
2019823 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2019824 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2019825 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2019826 a cabinet established through such an avenue will lack moral credibility parliament itself will be tarnished both the executive and the legislature two vital arms of governance will be perceived by the people as institutions that are bereft of integrity
2019827 although obama will continue crying foul no american can permit obama to define questioning a contender for the office of president of the united states of america as somehow out of bounds impolite mean spirited or animated by racial hatred
2019828 sir i ask you sir at long last have you no sense of decency sir
2019829 how the finns subjugated yll olevaantekstikentt njoko the country formerly known as china
2019830 it is a sad fact but that means that kinder surprise eggs have to go
2019831 there is absolutely no evidence that the kinder surprise eggs as a combination of toy and foodstuff are dangerous
2019832 the kinder surprise toy is separated from the chocolate by a plastic capsule
2019833 we have seen no evidence that the eggs are dangerous
2019834 do you think the combination of sweets and food is dangerous
2019835 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary it is their judgment about how to use the money they paid to ljungberg in a wiser way we all have our personal opinion about freddie and his efforts for this club
2019836 in some ways made things more difficult because the expectations became so high then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the premier league title but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner people are talking now about us not having won the league for 18 years but it was 21 years since this club had last won the european cup
2019837 chelsea have started to make a bad week even worse for real madrid by going public with an offer for the brazil winger robinho which is believed to be valued at 19 75m
2019838 we have been spending big but selling big and the net is less than the other big clubs
2019839 if ronaldos brain worked as quickly and productively as those clever feet he would tie himself to united for as long as ferguson was there
2019840 ronaldo could invoke article 17 at the end of the 2009 10 season and buy out the remaining two years of his 120 000 per week contract at a cost of 12 48 million
2019841 like the fans the press who cover this club are brought up watching legends and ronaldo you will never be one of them
2019842 paul has to be careful not least because he is so stubborn and single minded
2019843 its never easy to pre judge a team whove been revamped so quickly
2019844 some sort of beautiful madness must sweep through the premier league next season in order for hull to remain there
2019845 chelsea have started to make a bad week even worse for real madrid by going public with an offer for the brazil winger robinho which is believed to be valued at 19 75m real are down due to their failure to sign cristiano ronaldo from manchester united and their president ram n calder n who has already valued robinho at 60m 48m now faces a dilemma although he has signed the creative midfielder rafael van der vaart from hamburg his credibility would be damaged if he lost robinho a fans favourite for what could be viewed as a cut price figure
2019846 fernando torres and gerrard will again be crucial but while ben tez expects the arrival of robbie keane from tottenham hotspur and he hopes gareth barry whose prospective transfer from aston villa remains in limbo to help to ease the burden the manager believes that liverpools title ambitions will rest just as heavily on players such as daniel agger much missed through injury last season martin skrtel lucas leiva and ryan babel stepping up a level
2019847 the squad we had at the start did not have a very high value and this squad is the equal in value of the other top teams we have been spending big but selling big and the net is less than the other big clubs they were spending to add to very strong squads already where we have created a totally new squad there are only three or four players now from when we arrived but they are very very good players and we have a very very good squad maybe our european success hasnt helped us because it made people believe we were ready to challenge for the league when we were not
2019848 if ronaldos brain worked as quickly and productively as those clever feet he would tie himself to united for as long as ferguson was there harvest medals for two maximum three more seasons and then jet off to madrid ronaldo would then be 26 primed for five glorious years in castille sadly he seems likely to quit the united party early probably next summer so a cloud will follow united this season darkening and lengthening as the campaign progresses ronaldo will score goals destroy defences and collect a medal or two but the accompanying noises off will be an unwelcome distraction
2019849 united have by no means delivered a knockout blow however and although ronaldo will again wear the no 7 shirt when he returns from ankle surgery in the autumn retaining the services beyond the end of this season is likely to prove an altogether more difficult task with the unheralded webster ruling threatening to back united into a corner ronaldo could invoke article 17 at the end of the 2009 10 season and buy out the remaining two years of his 120 000 per week contract at a cost of 12 48 million which would not seem quite so prohibitive should a signing on fee of a similar amount be agreed with madrid
2019850 cristiano ronaldos summer romance with real madrid will be best remembered for the way he batted his eyelids only at the spanish press corps during the european championships for his eagerness to sanction suggestions that keeping him at old trafford was tantamount to slavery as he limped out of an algarve clinic in plaster
2019851 lets get something straight right from the off cristiano it was never your decision in the first place alex ferguson decided last year when he handed you a new contract to send your wages soaring that you were most definitely staying at manchester united so who on earth do you think you are to imagine that after two good seasons in five years at old trafford you can stand there believing you have your and the clubs destiny in your hands i wonder if we will see the real ronaldo again in a red shirt let us not forget all this is likely to start again in a years time for while saying you are staying you also made it very clear you wanted to go to real madrid and still do like the fans the press who cover this club are brought up watching legends and ronaldo you will never be one of them
2019852 but like frank lampard and emmanuel adebayor the portuguese superstar now faces the toughest task of all getting back onside with the supporters his summer conduct has alienated ronaldos dramatic u turn over his future came after he had angered and disgusted many of the old trafford fans not least with a sneering dismissal of their feelings in the aftermath of portugals euro 2008 exit no wonder then that sir alex fergusons nitial response to the confirmation of the players volte face was a plea to the supporters to understand his position it is plea that may fall on deaf ears
2019853 ronaldos decision to stay at manchester united is a massive blow that even the implicit opportunity to sign him in the future cannot soften not so much for coach bernd schuster nor for the players but for calderon himself who will now desperately scramble for a big name after all the one thing that matters more to him than anything else is at stake his own survival madrid may have won two successive league titles but calderon has not won the fans
2019854 paul has to be careful not least because he is so stubborn and single minded that was what made him such an unbelievable player but as a manager he may have to adapt but such is his nature hell only change when hes good and ready and not before i only hope he does not go the way of other managers who employed their rugged approach to management to great success in the lower divisions only to find it tough when dealing with international players and bigger egos in the leagues above but paul is a big man so i expect him to do just that
2019855 its never easy to pre judge a team whove been revamped so quickly
2019856 some sort of beautiful madness must sweep through the premier league next season in order for hull to remain there
2019857 i do think that this season will see a reaction to last that there will be no hull or bristol city in the mix come may that the traditionally bigger clubs will re group and be ready to do what nobody seemed willing to do last season just dominate week in and week out over a massive 46 game season the quality might be low but concentration must be paramount lets face it the only championship prediction you can be absolutely certain will come true is that there will be many many managers losing their jobs worryingly thats the only thing guaranteed to happen in this division
2019858 for a start there are the season ticket prices paul payne 41 agonised over whether to renew his familys season ticket when he learned the cost had shot up from 860 to 1 600 and while summer has seen a total refurbishment of the corporate end of the ground little has been done to improve seating for regular fans i think they painted the stairs jokes stephen dedridge chairman of supporters group qpr 1st the ticket prices were a big shock to us especially as its the same old stadium flavio briatores move to redesign the club badge has also proved controversial with the core support then there is the strange story of jude the clubs black cat mascot who was a favourite with fans the new owner was not so keen black cats are bad luck in briatores native italy after a brief colour change to grey jude disappeared
2019859 leicester in particular are going to find things tough ask any forest manchester city sheffield wednesday or for that matter leeds fan how easy it is to bounce straight back the mood is down but expectancy is up itll only take one mk dons goal at the walkers stadium on saturday to bring reality crashing home if anything leeds should be stronger this year their strength in depth would be the envy of several championship clubs while jermaine beckford has come of age as a goalscorer hell be aided and abetted by mystery man luciano becchio up front a former barcelona and boca juniors striker who was a prolific scorer in spains third division last season anything less than the title would be a failure
2019860 what a mess little leo messi is in hes 21 he does not have the bombastic ego of countless lesser stars but having been told it was his right and his duty to play at the olympics he set his heart on trying to help argentina keep the title it won in athens four years ago messi and to an extent the two bundesliga based brazilians owe as much to the lands which bred them as to the clubs that in messis case went to extraordinary lengths to mature him through an adolescence that required millions of dollars to pay the medical bills of a child born with a growth hormone deficiency
2019861 nuclear weapons were created by humans and it is our responsibility to eliminate them before they eliminate us
2019862 there is much we still dont know about the candidates positions
2019863 both state in general terms that they favor the goal of a nuclear weapons free world neither of them however has discussed seeking to achieve a nuclear weapons convention a treaty that would set forth a roadmap for the phased verifiable irreversible and transparent elimination of nuclear weapons
2019864 between the two candidates senator mccains positions seem more cautious and sketchy
2019865 obama has come out in favor of removing u s nuclear weapons from hair trigger alert not developing new nuclear weapons ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty and achieving a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material
2019866 well have major progress on nuclear issues no matter who is elected
2019867 it debunks the common view that obama is the most liberal democratic senator and it debunks the view that mccain is really the third bush term
2019868 adds significantly to the complications of controlling nuclear materials and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
2019869 obama also focuses much more on securing loose unsafe nuclear materials
2019870 both mccain and obama represent a departure from the status quo
2019871 acknowledges the unacceptable risks nuclear weapons pose merely by their existence
2019872 while both candidates appear to take nuclear proliferation seriously the difference in their worldview is of utmost importance
2019873 the only sure way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to rid the world of nuclear weapons
2019874 in the seventh decade of the nuclear age there is a glimmer of hope that new leadership in the united states may pave the way forward toward a world free of nuclear weapons
2019875 we joke about going to the maccabiah games and setting a world record
2019876 winning medals in the relays is such an amazing feeling being a part of a team
2019877 i was thinking about how many races i had to swim and i saved too much energy i learned a horrible lesson but it kind of got me going another four years i kind of felt like i had unfinished business
2019878 but to do something on your own feels pretty good i have a lot to prove to myself i know im capable i just havent done it yet
2019879 i think this is the best olympic swim team ever assembled
2019880 there are several events where we could get multiple medals and we could win all three relays
2019881 to finally be able to participate is going to be really exciting
2019882 i want to go there and come back with some hardware
2019883 potent moralism and idealism in world affairs a belief in americas exceptional role as a promoter of the principles of liberty and democracy
2019884 the effort to explain the iraq war as the product of manipulation by a handful of neoconservatives
2019885 is an effort to escape what for many may be a more troubling reality that there is something in the american character which leads it in this direction
2019886 belief in americas exceptional role as a promoter of the principles of liberty and democracy
2019887 there is a mysterious cycle in human events to some generations much is given of other generations much is expected this generation of americans has a rendezvous with destiny
2019888 member must have an open checking account or open a checking account to be eligible for a silver lining savings account
2019889 charged on a share account starting the 13th month of inactivity and continuing until there is no balance or money is escheated to the state
2019890 this fee does not apply to members under 18 members with loans or iras or any member with aggregated deposits over 200
2019891 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
2019892 dont play with fire dont ever touch religious and racial matters
2019893 why has the bar council been stoking the fires of disunity lately like they have been used by foreign powers who want to create chaos and intervene in the countrys internal affairs
2019894 whatever the excuses given the forum would still provoke malay sentiment and create uneasiness and public disorder particularly among the malays
2019895 it is pointless to organise forums based on intellectualism professionalism or controversial issues when the safety peace harmony and stability of the country were being compromised
2019896 all the news you never knew you needed to know until now
2019897 the german dream was to be the super race and we didnt belong to that dream
2019898 it was wonderful for us in argentina and there was a big jewish community of refugees
2019899 they had all the sports facilities you could dream of
2019900 for us the most satisfying thing was that in argentina all the womens track and field records were in german nazi hands and now comes a group of jewish girls that took that away
2019901 in the beginning all my shots went out of bounds
2019902 we played with other clubs and we played all over south america
2019903 for us it was the beginning of the end for the germans
2019904 we all came back together and it was like we never left
2019905 we were very very lucky and we were a large family
2019906 for two years we have been taking steps to sharpen our focus on health care supply chain services and clinical and medical products culminating with our announcement in july to operate these businesses in two distinct segments that reflect the unique characteristics and requirements of each
2019907 as we now consider a spin off of our clinical and medical products businesses our goal is simple to have two thriving businesses delivering maximum value to customers and shareholders over the long term
2019908 overall fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations
2019909 we continued to demonstrate to customers the value of our clinically differentiated medical technologies where we delivered a year of very strong growth on the top and bottom lines
2019910 in fiscal 2009 we plan to make incremental investments of up to 100 million to strengthen r amp d in the clinical and medical products business and improve information technology in the supply chain services business
2019911 these investments will affect our earnings growth rates in fiscal 2009 but are important foundational moves that we believe will accelerate future growth in both segments
2019912 this means that there is a gap the law doesnt exist to protect people against a certain type of hate crime and the protection has to be restored
2019913 hate crimes are intended to intimidate entire groups of people
2019914 the methods used by the pennsylvania legislature in passing the hate crimes bill were extremely devious and yet another chilling example as to how far politicians are willing to go to silence christian speech
2019915 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
2019916 i remember the impact and then i had no control over my head i wasnt focused so much on the pain
2019917 i sure could swallow it better if they just raised the price
2019918 due to inflation and wanting to keep ourself in the red we are going to charge you more for your 96 oz but hey at least were not hiding it from you like our competitors here see this is their old package and this is there new for the same price in your neighborhood hey at least were honest
2019919 shawn you must work for tropicana why would you defend them
2019920 i will no longer buy your product until you start trusting us with the reality instead of letting your marketing teams try and fool us
2019921 under the constitution and federal law i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
2019922 all sides should bring an immediate end to the violence and engage in direct talks to resolve this matter peacefully
2019923 the georgian leadership has unleashed a dirty adventure blood spilled in south ossetia will be blamed on these people and their associates
2019924 huffing and puffing would blow the houses over the dorze know how to build if rot or termites destroy them they simply cut around the bottom lift and move them over to a new location they can last up to 60 years which is a lot longer than most of our houses
2019925 we do have to solve our issues late in games manuel said
2019926 take my old man out of the closet in my mind and give him a good thrashing for all the hateful things he has said and done through the years
2019927 ive never had much luck arguing with him have you ever argued with a pop culture icon have you ever argued with a guy who can cause a frenzy among thousands at a convention hall simply by performing a vulcan hand salute
2019928 sweet referred to stewarts great preformance reviews guess i shoulda maybe said that in the first place
2019929 the biggest criticism were the cuts which director gregory doran made to the play
2019930 hu yuk i guessn dey dumbed it down fer the chicks
2019931 china and afghanistan enjoy a traditional friendship and sound relations
2019932 causing the most serious damages affecting the most extensive areas and posing the greatest difficulty in disaster relief
2019933 despite the difficulties china has the confidence to achieve an overall victory in earthquake relief and help the people in the quake hit areas to rebuild their beautiful homes at an early date with the assistance of the international community
2019934 if this is not war then i wonder what is

2019937 the west is provoking a new cold war with russia
2019938 they are worried that in a multipolar world not all poles are going to be equal
2019939 but anyone who pays 17 000 00 for a replica of a famous guitar made famous by a famous musician and actually takes the stage with it just might be more irritating than a million star trek conventions at the same time
2019940 enquirer yeah were timing the release of edwards details to mess with the dem convention
2019941 australia and china as a result of our meetings here in beijing in march april have agreed to establish an australia china climate change ministerial dialogue
2019942 that will have its first meeting now in canberra in november and were looking forward to those discussions with our chinese friends
2019943 its tough its a big challenge and of course if you have a combination of pollution factors and haze factors its always going to be difficult to deal with
2019944 that strikes me as a responsible course of action its the right course of action these things have to be subjected to science and therefore the burden lies very much with the ioc to make sure that happens
2019945 we are delighted to achieve yet another milestone by the launch of our medical tourism services in gujarat keeping customer in mind our corporate ethics are based on a single point program thus bringing to the customer the information on best of the hospitals and health care centers located in various parts of the india along with information on the top hotels available in the vicinity as an integral part of a comprehensive wellness package we strive to take away the rigors that one encounters while undergoing a treatment thus the special and customized packages are designed exclusively to meet with the patients needs and requirements we at indian aura have taken utmost care in ensuring that our patients are in safe hands and thus we have associated with the leading hospitals in india supported by renowned therapist columbia asia hospitals a group of 19 hospital worldwide and one of the biggest hospitals in asia continent head quartered at bangalore and wockhardt hospital group to name a few also to help our customers recuperate and heal faster we have associated with some of the best palaces resorts spas and hotels whose ambience and atmosphere will guarantee quick recovery hrh hotels and grand intercontinental group to name a few

2019947 we have a camp in london where you go from the dancing room to the singing room to the acting room to the dialect coach its all day like that and i cant wait to get started
2019948 as we recall the previous olympic bid we contemplate the present and recall the past with emotion when all sorts of feelings well up in our minds
2019949 unfortunately our previous olympic bid failed the commentary published was the latter one which wrote
2019950 not to get conceited because of victory and not to be downhearted because of defeat that is the demeanor and bearing the chinese people should have there are many years to come and we will certainly meet again someday we believe in this oriental country with one fifth of the worlds population a territory of 9 6 million km and a history of over 5 000 year civilization the days when the olympic five ring flag flies high in the sky will not be far off compatriots lets continue our efforts to greet the arrival of this day
2019951 the public are expecting the olympic games their dream has come true beijing thanks the world the 27th olympic games is a grand gathering to be held at a time when we bid farewell to the 20th century and welcome in the 21st century it is of a cross century significance it offers a very rare opportunity and is the focus of world attention the ioc has made a historic choice and given china high honor and a valuable opportunity the chinese people will merit the great trust and go all out to hand in an answer sheet to the satisfaction of the world people
2019952 an open china is expecting the olympic games an open china is fully capable of hosting an olympic games successfully compatriots lets extend our two hands to welcome the 2000 a new olympic horizon
2019953 that commentary can only be kept as a historical material when we often recall this we feel deeply regret when we often recall this we are convinced that the chinese people can certainly fulfill their olympic games dream
2019954 beijing again filed an application for hosting the olympic games eight years later
2019955 flowers are similar every year but people are different year after year
2019956 writing the most magnificent chapter in the olympic games history
2019957 beijings two olympic bids went through eight years the chinese people had undergone
2019958 the winning of the 2008 olympic bid is an example of the international recognition of chinas social stability economic progress and the healthy life of the chinese people
2019959 the overall presence of strong governmental control and support is healthy
2019960 the winning of the 2008 olympic bid is an example of the international recognition of chinas social stability economic progress and the healthy life of the chinese people
2019961 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhances all social conditions including education health and human rights
2019962 the chinese authorities have broken their promise to improve the countrys human rights situation and betrayed the core values of the olympics there has been no progress towards fulfilling these promises only continued deterioration unless the authorities make a swift change of direction the legacy of the beijing olympics will not be positive for human rights in china
2019963 in the run up to the olympics the chinese authorities have locked up put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of
2019964 the chinese government wont allow the spread of any information that is forbidden by law or harms national interests on the internet
2019965 had the i o c known seven years ago that there would be severe restrictions then i seriously doubt whether beijing would have been awarded the olympics
2019966 official data during the aug 8 to aug 24 olympic period indicates air quality was actually worse in 2006 and 2007 than in 2000 and 2001
2019967 what i want what i really really want is to bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran
2019968 if he did play at home it was over the weekend
2019969 cancelling it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars for republican candidates across the country
2019970 guilt or innocence cant even be talked about outside of a fair judicial process
2019971 we have to be as bad as our opponents because good guys cant win in this world
2019972 alas not all of them are of drinking age as we detained some 14 and 15 year olds without charge and held them in an offshore prison camp to get around domestic and international law maybe they can have applejuice
2019973 its ashame but there are terror tots who were raised in the ways of jihad as infants
2019974 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient my emphasis trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
2019975 we wanted to put a lot of play features back into the cars after all theyre toys
2019976 for us as a company wed never broken into vehicles you want to be able to get a piece of every pie in toys
2019977 one of the first things they gravitate to as they develop motor skills is rolling a car what a great opportunity that is for us

2019980 its no secret that i really dont like road courses
2019981 the first thing that jumps out is the fact that compared to sonoma the glen is certainly faster and not nearly as technical
2019982 at sonoma there is more braking more shifting and the speeds are down at the glen the speeds are way up
2019983 coming off the corners you are right on the throttle where at sonoma it seems you are always waiting searching for grip and have to be a little more cautious
2019984 i think a guy whos good around watkins glen is good with the brakes
2019985 youve got to be able to late brake and also carry a lot of momentum through the center of the corners and get off the corners quick i think thats the secret to being fast around watkins glen
2019986 anyone who has been around long enough has a memorable experience to talk about regarding turn 1 at the glen i can guarantee you that
2019987 ive passed a ton of cars there and ive been passed by more than i want to think about in that turn
2019988 but the biggest thing about that particular turn is that its a place where you come in there always expecting to see the unexpected occur i dont know how many times ive come flying down the front chute and gone in there too hot and overshot the corner
2019989 the biggest key is you have to get wide open through the esses
2019990 all the passing will happen in turns 1 and 9 so you really have to have your car dialed in for those two places its pretty much an open road course you can use it like an oval and set it up to go to the right
2019991 its a lot of fun to go to watkins glen
2019992 its got a lot of history to it its known as one of americas finest race tracks as far as road racing goes its got a lot of character
2019993 drivers once more shift gears to take on a cup road course this time watkins glen
2019994 even though ive had my share of ups and downs at the glen i still consider it my home track
2019995 i like everything about it the track the area the people the restaurants the saidhead fan club and seneca lodge
2019996 i had the fastest car that day and i know i could have won the race
2019997 but i got punted from behind by robby spun out and hit the fence that one is still hard to swallow
2019998 you can bet its going to rain at the glen but you hope its not during qualifying
2019999 i look at the weather map every day and right now i have my fingers crossed for friday ive had some good cars that never made it to the starting grid because of rain
