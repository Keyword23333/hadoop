5800068 we will do everything we can to improve the deal we give people encourage them to use our card not someone elses and avoid fees
5800069 as a last resort we are considering a fee for a minority of customers that simply do not use their card
5800070 given barclaycard holds a market share of around 15 it is likely we will see this trend spread across the entire industry
5800071 this is probably a good time for consumers to ensure they close down any accounts they no longer use
5800072 this is because some creditors are taking a hard line over ivas and rejecting them
5800073 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5800074 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5800075 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics
5800076 its great news for the free speech rights for these students
5800077 although its extremely unfortunate that the students were not allowed to give their talk at defcon
5800078 it was definitely unfair to use that statute to silence the students
5800079 we certainly hope the next time that people are allowed to present their important research instead of being silenced by bogus lawsuits
5800080 were glad the court actually saw things as they should be
5800081 all the material we were going to talk about has been made public and more
5800082 despite whats happened and the animosity the mbta has brought toward us
5800083 i cant really comment on the actual means that we used
5800084 its probably not a good idea to comment on that we certainly did not get free fare we had to spend several hundred dollars on buying tickets to look at the data structure far more than we ever would have used
5800085 canonical is an important new member for the linux foundation
5800086 we are extremely pleased to work even more closely with canonical as we push linux to the next stage of growth

5800090 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us

5800092 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5800093 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale

5800095 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported
5800096 the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation
5800097 the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically
5800098 the real key has been the rapid growth in penetration of broadband connected pcs in all markets around the world broadband connected pcs are a key driver of growth for pc gaming
5800099 i flew in two days ago to prepare the boat
5800100 not much to do on a dock like this but add extra lines and make sure the boat can rise and fall with the tide
5800101 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5800102 they should continue to stay calm and be smart and make sure they exercise common sense
5800103 these are our last babies were going to get to hold

5800117 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
5800118 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
5800119 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
5800120 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
5800121 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
5800122 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5800123 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5800124 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5800125 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5800126 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
5800127 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests
5800128 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5800129 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5800130 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5800131 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
5800132 jlo is planning on donating money raised for her race to the childrens hospital of los angeles to help drum up attention lopez started a blog to share tips on training jennifer lopez no entiende por que todos hablan de michael phelps
5800133 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
5800134 making the same sort of margins on these smaller less expensive vehicles is all but impossible
5800135 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5800136 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5800137 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5800138 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5800139 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5800140 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5800141 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional us1 billion 1 15 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5800142 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5800143 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5800144 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces
5800145 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5800146 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5800147 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance centre last night was not under the command of coalition forces
5800148 this was an iraqi planned and executed operation without the involvement of the coalition forces an american air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets

5800161 i can honestly say i am not a drugs cheat i have been tested throughout the time of my ban during competition and i will continue to be tested
5800162 our taxpayer money is not going to good use for these automatic weapons
5800163 there is a trend around the country of police departments getting more and more sophisticated weapons
5800164 the reason is that we have the same trend with our criminals who are arming themselves with these weapons
5800165 after 9 11 police departments became much more militarized in terms of response
5800166 tactical units were no longer just looked upon as a response to a situation with a couple of hostages but more of a counterterrorism unit there is this feeling that we now live in an era of counterterrorism and the feeling is that you need to be prepared
5800167 plus there are situations in the schools that have happened across the country we practice active shooter scenarios these days and these weapons are the best ones to handle these types of situations
5800168 paterson passaic and clifton should be armed to the teeth because there are a whole lot more weapons found in those areas
5800169 up here we need to have them in case we have a situation like in the north hollywood robbery i dont think in an area like this it would be feasible to have every officer have weapons like this in the trunk of their vehicle
5800170 were very fortunate that weve come to some very peaceful conclusions to most of the jobs over the years in bergen county
5800171 if you have to wait for somebody to go to paramus to pick up a ump it absolutely defeats the purpose
5800172 its not like a firetruck or a street sweeper you can schedule its a piece of equipment that has to be readily available to an officer at a moments notice
5800173 i wouldnt care if they had tanks if they needed them
5800174 im for having everything at your disposal as long as its used cautiously and in a measured way
5800175 i think the police have the right to protect themselves the best they can
5800176 but its not like the movies this is north arlington i could see it in new york city but its relatively quiet here
5800177 this proves everyone wrong all the things that have been said about her it has been a very difficult few years for her and for the whole family
5800178 but she has proved herself to the whole world she proved herself at the world championships and now she has done it at the olympics
5800179 i always knew she would do it but when i spoke to her this morning she was really worried
5800180 i said to her just relax and you will do it she said thank you daddy
5800181 i knew she had the power the strength was there i said all she had to do was relax and she would do it and she has performed
5800182 im ecstatic we just watched her getting her medal i cant wait to speak to her

5800360 immature people falling in love destroy each others freedom create a bondage make a prison mature persons in love help each other to be free they help each other to destroy all sorts of bondages and when love flows with freedom there is beauty when love flows with dependence there is ugliness a mature person does not fall in love he or she rises in love only immature people fall they stumble and fall down in love somehow they were managing and standing now they cannot manage and they cannot stand they were always ready to fall on the ground and to creep they dont have the backbone the spine they dont have the integrity to stand alone a mature person has the integrity to stand alone and when a mature person gives love he or she gives without any strings attached to it when two mature persons are in love one of the great paradoxes of life happens one of the most beautiful phenomena they are together and yet tremendously alone they are together so much that they are almost one two mature persons in love help each other to become more free there is no politics involved no diplomacy no effort to dominate only freedom and love

5800363 oh dear wife and children i am distressed by this burden upon my back moreover i am certain our city will be burned by fire from heaven we shall all perish unless i find a way for us to escape
5800364 sir i read in this bible that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second
5800365 why are you not willing to die since this life is so full of evil
5800366 i fear that this burden on my back will sink me to hell i am not ready to go to judgment
5800367 you dwell in the city of destruction and dying there you will sink into a place that burns with fire and brimstone com along with me
5800368 those are not worthy to be compared with what i seek i seek an inheritance incorruptible undefiled that never fades away it awaits in heaven to be bestowed o those who diligently seek it read about it in my bible
5800369 no because i have put my hand to the plow
5800370 if what good christian says is true the things he looks for are better than ours my heart longs to go with him
5800371 are you certain the words of your book are true
5800372 yes the bible was made by he who cannot lie there is an endless kingdom to inhabit and everlasting life we will be given crowns of glory and garments that will make us shine like the sun there will be no more crying no more sorrow we shall be with seraphims and cherubims and creatures that will dazzle our eyes we shall meet with ten of thousands that have gone before us loving and holy everyone walking in the sight of god all well again and clothed in the garment of immortality
5800373 that if we are willing to have it he will bestow it on us freely
5800374 the hearing of this is enough to delight one heart come let us quicken our pace
5800375 fear followed me so hard i fell in the slough
5800376 the slough of despond cannot be mended so that travelers pass safely it is the accumulation of scum and filth that continually runs from the conviction for sin because even though the sinner is awakened to his lost condition fears and doubts and discouraging apprehensions still run from his soul and settle in the slough it is not the pleasure of the king that the slough remain so bad there are by direction of the lawgiver certain good and substantial steps placed evenly through the very midst of the slough yet because of the filth the steps are hardly seen or if they are dizzy men fall by the side anyway
5800377 there is no more dangerous and troublesome way in the world than that which evangelist has directed you hear me you will meet weariness pain hunger peril sword lions dragons darkness and in a word death
5800378 but this burden on my back is more terrible to me i dont care what i meet if i also meet deliverance from by burden
5800379 i thought so it has happened to other weak men too remedy is at hand you will meet with safety friendship and content

5800383 god said my righteous one will live by faith and if he shrinks back i will not be pleased with him you have begun to reject the counsel of the most high you drew back your foot from the way of peace
5800384 the lord says every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven so be not faithless but believing
5800385 worldly wiseman who savors only the doctrine of this world did three terrible things first he turned you from the way secondly worldly wiseman disparaged the cross to you thirdly he sent you on the way to death
5800386 all who rely on observing the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law
5800387 may i now enter here will he within open to sorry me though i have been an undeserving rebel then shall i not fail to sing his lasting praise on high
5800388 i am a poor burden sinner i come from the city of destruction but i am going to celestial city so that i might be delivered from the wrath to come are you willing to let me in

5800397 16 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life 17 and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments 18 he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness 19 honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 20 the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet 21 jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me 22 but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions 23 then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven 24 and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 25 when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved 26 but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
5800398 16 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
5800399 20 the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet
5800400 what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
5800401 21 jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me
5800402 if you want to enter into life keep the commandments
5800403 if you want to be perfect go sell give to the poor and come follow me
5800404 8 all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
5800405 10 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity
5800406 22 he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
5800407 19 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal
5800408 16 be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased 17 for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him 18 though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself 19 he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see light 20 man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish
5800409 18 neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lords wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land
5800410 4 yet i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt know no god but me for there is no saviour beside me 5 i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought 6 according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me
5800411 4 the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts
5800412 11 forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor and ye take from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards but ye shall not drink wine of them 12 for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right
5800413 4 hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail 5 saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit 6 that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat
5800414 5 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry
5800415 9 but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition
5800416 20 a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent
5800417 contentment comes not so much from great wealth as from few wants
5800418 11 not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content 12 i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need
5800419 7 for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out
5800420 8 and having food and raiment let us be therewith content
5800421 21 then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me
5800422 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord

5800434 the governments own report admits that there has been a torrent of data breaches in whitehall this shows that the government cannot be trusted to protect peoples personal details
5800435 ministers should think again about its even more risky and intrusive projects such as the identity card database the all encompassing childrens database and the property database for the council tax revaluation
5800436 tougher safeguards are needed to protect the privacy of law abiding citizens from the government
5800437 the cabinet secretarys review of data handling published at the end of june put in place mandatory safeguards to make our information assurance as robust as possible and improve transparency
5800438 departments are taking intensive action to improve data security including extra training for hundreds of thousands of staff and the problems reported in recently published resource accounts were made public as a result of this new approach

5800465 act works to mobilize parents professionals private and governmental regulators prosecutors juries and legislators to end the physical torture and emotional abuse that is attachment therapy
5800466 the imposition of boundary violations most often coercive restraint and verbal abuse on a child usually for hours at a time typically the child is put in a lap hold with the arms pinned down or alternatively an adult lies on top of a child lying prone on the floor
5800467 a growing underground movement for the treatment of children who pose disciplinary problems to their parents or caregivers
5800468 almost always involves extremely confrontational often hostile confrontation of a child by a therapist or parent sometimes both restraint of the child by more powerful adult s is considered an essential part of the confrontation
5800469 for our purposes we have identified several distinguishing characteristics any one of which qualifies a practice to be called attachment therapy
5800470 practices teaches or recommends restraint or other violations of interpersonal boundaries for an allegedly therapeutic purpose the things mentioned are often deliberately confrontational and intrusive
5800471 principally treats or is concerned with a condition of attachment disorder distinct from the dsm recognized diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder and assesses for that condition using unvalidated diagnostic tools or uses no tools at all for objective assessment
5800472 practices or recommends treatment based on a belief in the efficacy of any of the following re traumatization catharsis especially through expression of rage fear sadness or other negative emotion recapitulation re enactment re living or re doing of stages of development or re patterning of the brain
5800473 adheres to unvalidated notions about child development or attachment especially the so called attachment cycle aka bonding cycle need cycle rage cycle though reference may be made to the attachment theory pioneered by
5800474 claims that at practices are safe and efficacious when there is a near complete lack of scientific support
5800475 practices or teaches harsh parenting and respite methods based principally upon combinations of deprivation isolation or humiliation for the child
5800476 uncritically recommends materials such as websites books videos lectures and conference presentations which do any of the above
5800477 a large fringe element of pseudo scientific psychotherapists attachment therapists at have invented the dubious unrecognized diagnosis of attachment disorder ad and its cure ad is thought to be a childs inability to form a close loving relationship with his caregiver typically because of early childhood abuse or neglect many if not most undesirable behaviors seen in childhood supposedly stem from ad
5800478 what our team has identified is an experimental drug therapy that can provide pain relief to patients within 20 minutes
5800479 depending on the individual in my experience one dose can last from 6 to 40 hours the ability of the therapy to provide immediate relief is something entirely new for sufferers of interstitial cystitis
5800480 women who suffer from this condition may find themselves having to urinate ten or more times per day usually have pain or symptom flares after sexual intercourse and frequently have chronic pelvic pain
5800481 a irlanda tem os impostos mais baixos da europa porque recebe dinheiros pagos com os impostos dos demais cidad o da europa

5800510 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5800511 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5800512 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming

5800514 i lost my cousin clare to breast cancer when she was just 35 in our conversations as she neared the end of her brave fight she reminded me how important it is to enjoy life to its fullest dont worry about having an extra inch on your bottom just stick on your high heels and wiggle it thats why ive jumped at the chance to be involved with burlesque against breast cancer

5800516 judge otoole said he disagreed with the basic premise of the mbtas argument that the students presentation was a likely violation of the computer fraud and abuse act a 1986 federal law meant to protect computers from malicious attacks such as worms and viruses
5800517 the last time that these regulations were changed in a meaningful way was in 1986
5800518 our intent is to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa
5800519 this is the bush administrations latest effort to gut one of our nations most important environmental laws if these regulations had been in place 20 years ago we would not have brought the bald eagle back from extinction
5800520 only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
5800521 with striking arrogance the administration apparently believes that it can succeed now with this discredited agenda because the american people and congress are distracted by a presidential campaign and other pressing business
5800522 the last time that these regulations were changed in a meaningful way gasoline was under 1 gal
5800523 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
5800524 kites waves tides ocean currents geysers garbage cow manure old utility poles algae and bacteria are being enlisted in the effort to lower the worlds reliance on climate warming coal and oil researchers are even trying artificial photosynthesis producing electricity by imitating the way that green plants exploit the suns energy
5800525 most of these ideas may never make economic or technological sense its always possible however that a daffy sounding scheme could turn out to be the next google gps facebook or similar breakthrough
5800526 we believe that in light of the increasing cost of energy in china and throughout the world demand for our portfolio of products will continue to grow at a high rate we think that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend and will continue to aggressively pursue growth in this market
5800527 if that were true wouldnt one expect at least one of the landowners to ask for something in writing
5800528 wouldnt there be one piece of historical evidence supporting that allegation

5800540 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5800541 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5800542 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5800543 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work

5800566 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

5800629 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5800630 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5800631 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5800632 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5800633 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5800634 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5800635 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5800636 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5800637 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

5800639 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5800640 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5800641 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5800642 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5800643 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5800644 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5800645 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5800646 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5800647 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5800648 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5800649 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5800650 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5800651 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

5800655 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5800656 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5800657 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5800658 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5800659 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
5800660 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5800661 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5800662 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5800663 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5800664 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5800665 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5800666 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5800667 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5800668 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5800669 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5800670 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5800671 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5800672 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5800673 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5800674 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5800675 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
5800676 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
5800677 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
5800678 the project seems to have a momentum of its own
5800679 we realized that p2p networks were not taking advantage of the flexibility that exists
5800680 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5800681 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5800682 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5800683 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5800684 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5800685 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5800686 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5800687 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

5800691 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5800692 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5800693 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5800694 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5800695 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5800696 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5800697 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5800698 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5800699 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5800700 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5800701 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5800702 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5800703 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5800704 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5800705 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5800706 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again

5801146 students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5801147 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory

5801149 i know all over the world it is like 18 some places 16 in canada its 19 i always thought 21 was a weird number at 18 youre old enough to join the army and die but you cant drink a beer
5801150 it drives alcohol use underground where it cant be observed it cant be controlled i think you increase the number who are drinking in secret and driving off campus to drink
5801151 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5801152 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5801153 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5801154 even with myself ive seen maturity since i was 18
5801155 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation

5801177 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5801178 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5801179 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5801180 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5801181 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5801182 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5801183 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5801184 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5801185 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5801186 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5801187 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5801188 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5801189 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

5801191 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5801192 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5801193 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5801194 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5801195 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5801196 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5801197 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5801198 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5801199 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5801200 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5801201 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5801202 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5801203 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5801204 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5801205 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5801206 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5801207 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5801208 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5801209 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5801210 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5801211 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5801212 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5801213 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5801214 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5801215 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5801216 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5801217 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5801218 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5801219 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5801220 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5801221 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5801222 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5801223 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5801224 there is an overwhelming demand from consumers and retailers for toys that are good for the environment and safe for kids out new line of toys made from recycled plastic milk containers delivers on both counts
5801225 by using post consumer recycled plastic we close the loop and show kids the real world benefits of recycling
5801226 green toys re enforces our company mission to source toys that minimize the impact on the environment by reusing recycling and reducing the carbon footprint in manufacturing or delivery these toys will help parents educate their children to take care of the environment
5801227 i am shocked and dismayed with todays news that congressman broun would be so careless with taxpayer money he has regularly voted against the interests of hardworking georgia families voting against critical programs for needy children benefits for veterans and against stronger law enforcement for child pornography all the while spending our tax dollars promoting his name
5801228 today i call on paul broun jr to refund the 562 000 of hard earned taxpayer money that he spent on shameless self promotion congressman brouns hypocritical position on government spending illustrates the need for true positive change in the 10th district if elected unlike congressman broun i will provide the responsible leadership this district deserves
5801229 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5801230 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5801231 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5801232 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5801233 this is a planning took where all things are going
5801234 si de algo se han dado cuenta los parlamentarios del mercosur es la enorme presi n que ha montado el gobierno
5801235 que el poder legislativo defienda a capa y espada una decisi n administrativa de otro poder que es la contralor a
5801236 por qu no vino el contralor a defender su medida y por qu no mand a su gente a defender esa medida por qu tiene que ser el poder legislativo
5801237 es decir esas son las contradicciones que ac se est n dando cuenta y eso reafirma que en venezuela no hay autonom a de poder
5801238 lo va a recibir la comisi n en pleno de ciudadan a y ddhh y creo que ha sido algo importante
5801239 hay un debate intenso en el mercosur sobre el tema venezolano y sobre todo al referido a los ddhh pero no solamente estamos registrando el caso concreto de leopoldo y los inhabilitados sino que tambi n hay un conjunto de casos que fueron recogidos en venezuela sino que tambi n hay un conjunto de casos que fueron recogidos en venezuela y que se han hecho parte del informe que ha presentado la comisi n de ddhh a la comisi n
5801240 de manera que veremos al tiempo una serie de reuniones de esta comisi n donde estar presente distintos y diversos casos por violaci n de ddhh
5801241 no sabemos a ciencia cierta cual puede ser el impacto completo porque el parlamento del mercosur tiene apenas unos meses en funcionamiento y est n adecuando toda sus legislaci n y toda su parte reglamentaria
5801242 todo el apoyo adicional y la log stica de 350 mil que trabajaran
5801243 hacemos un llamado a la oposici n a que se lean la leyes aprobadas por v a habilitante y que debatamos en el terreno de las ideas
5801244 ya nosotros sabemos por d nde va a entrar la oposici n por eso le hacemos un llamado para que se lean las leyes y vamos a debatir en el terreno de las ideas queremos que nos digan con argumentos por qu no est n de acuerdo con el financiamiento del 100 de la vivienda
5801245 no tienen norte no tienen br jula no tienen l der a diferencia de nosotros que s tenemos l der y proyecto de pa s es lamentable que no crean en el poder popular ellos buscan el reparto de la torta el reparto burocr tico
5801246 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5801247 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5801248 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5801249 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5801250 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5801251 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5801252 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5801253 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5801254 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5801255 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5801256 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5801257 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5801258 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5801259 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5801260 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5801261 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5801262 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5801263 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5801264 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5801265 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5801266 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5801267 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5801268 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5801269 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5801270 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5801271 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5801272 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5801273 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5801274 hay algunos lugares donde todav a no hemos logrado tener la candidatura unitaria eso no quiere decir que hemos abandonado el esfuerzo de esa candidatura unitaria seguimos trabajando para procurarla
5801275 hay algunos lugares donde se nos dificult m s la definici n porque los mecanismos que hab amos acordado para tomar las decisiones no nos ayudaron mucho estados donde las encuestas arrojaron un ganador una otro la otra y la otra un empate entonces no pudimos resolver el tema de la candidatura unitaria para la semana pasada
5801276 en las pr ximas semanas aspiramos buscar un mecanismo para ponernos de acuerdo entre los factores involucrados que nos permita definir esa candidatura unitaria y finalmente tener un solo candidato para las elecciones de noviembre sobre todo en esos lugares donde si no vamos unidos no vamos a ganar las elecciones
5801277 de los 22 estados donde se van a realizar elecciones este mes de noviembre en 19 de ellos ya hay candidatos unitarios el balance es muy positivo
5801278 quiero informar que las decisiones que se pueden tomar son si se acepta o no se acepta el caso expuesto por nosotros en la comisi n de ddhh del mercosur
5801279 tengo mucha fe en que la comisi n va a aceptar el caso y que se va a proceder a la investigaci n yo espero que esta comisi n escuche no solamente nuestra versi n sino que escuche tambi n la versi n del contralor general de la rep blica y la versi n del pueblo que no pudo elegir
5801280 estamos ac defendiendo nuestro derecho a elegir y el derecho a ser electo y vinimos armados de lo m s poderoso que se puede tener en una democracia que es la constituci n el estado de derecho y en este caso la convenci n americana de derechos humanos
5801281 fuimos muy claros con respecto a lo que significa nuestra argumentaci n con respecto a la constitucionalidad de nuestro derecho a ser candidatos y de la inconstitucionalidad de las decisiones del estado venezolano y tambi n de la necesidad de que las decisiones en el gobierno nacional sean coherentes con la convenci n americana de ddhh
5801282 finalmente fuimos recibidos por la comisi n de ddhh del mercosur y hablamos en nombre de candidatos del interior lo nico que pido es ser escuchado y entiendo que estoy enfrentando a un estado muy poderoso que tiene el control absoluto de las instituciones en nuestro pa s a un estado que ha politizado las instituciones y que fuera de nuestro pa s utiliza el petr leo como un arma para la diplomacia que lo ha desarrollado como un mecanismo incluso para la democracia del chantaje
5801283 fue muy controversial ac dentro de la comisi n yo mantuve una posici n de lo dif cil que es para nosotros el intercambio de ideas sin embargo hoy se pudo respetar la visi n de cada uno
5801284 estaban unos diputados oficialistas venezolanos que cuando les toc a ellos el derecho de palabra recurrieron a lo nico que recurren cuando no tienen la verdad hablar de los hechos del 2002 hablar del golpismo hablar del fascismo y decir que nosotros no podemos ser candidatos porque hemos estado vinculados a hechos del pasado
5801285 canonical is an important new member for the linux foundation

5801288 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5801289 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5801290 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5801291 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale
5801292 these are the domains where we have domain specific task oriented

5801298 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5801299 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5801300 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5801301 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5801302 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5801303 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5801304 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5801305 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5801306 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5801307 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5801308 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5801309 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5801310 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5801311 whitney swarthmore iii and jenny paoli are totally going to write us stories about how they captured and killed osama bin laden but only too late realized it was barack obama but hey either is fine with us
5801312 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5801313 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5801314 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5801315 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5801316 feel lucky you have a job in a community where you actually want to live with your family and buck up about the rest

5801362 bad seed aims to bring mens sexiest fantasies to life and this collaboration with topco sales helps us realize our vision more thoroughly
5801363 weve already had great success with the adam amp eve which is inspired by the adult film eden and features couples and female friendly packaging we wanted a hardcore sub brand of adam amp eve something more raunchy and geared toward men and the bad seed films were a perfect fit
5801364 since the x rated nature of most hardcore films prevents them from having an international distribution bad seed has skillfully removed or re shot the hardcore content and the result is five softcore but entirely titillating films that will satisfy on all seven continents
5801365 innovation is the hallmark of topco sales so were extremely excited to be collaborating with visionaries like adam amp eve on such a creative venture the combination of steamy dvds from bad seed and realistic feeling toys from topco catapults you directly into the fantasy
5801366 the example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of the seller of musk and the one who blows the blacksmiths bellows so as for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some or you buy some from him or at least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him as for the one who blows the blacksmiths bellows then either he will burn your clothes or you will get an offensive smell from him

5801370 jesus died for the forgiveness of sins if you do not see sin in others then neither do you see their need of the blood of jesus you cannot have it both ways wp bible plugin so when you preach the gospel to people you are pointing at their sins and that is the loving thing to do you may object that no it is the holy spirit who is convicting them of sin you are just the instrument and make no judgment yourself but as gods instrument you must concur with what god is doing through you and god is not seeing only the good in people he is seeing the evil in people and urging them to see it what virtue is there in your being blind to it

5801374 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5801375 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5801376 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go

5801384 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5801385 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5801386 i am not saying that nmdc should increase prices but how can i say that it should not do so especially in view of the fact that the psu cannot remain oblivious to market forces and is open to do what is best in its interests as of now we have no plans to intervene on this issue
5801387 studies have shown that pharmaceuticals are present in our nations water bodies
5801388 further research suggests that certain drugs may cause ecological harm more research is needed to determine the extent of ecological harm and any role it may have in potential human health effects
5801389 but their presence in water is a concern and we are continuing to evaluate their risk to human health
5801390 members of the ap national investigative team reviewed hundreds of scientific reports analyzed federal drinking water databases visited environmental study sites and treatment plants and interviewed more than 230 officials academics and scientists
5801391 pharmaceuticals have probably been present in water and the environment for as long as humans have been using them
5801392 the drugs we take are not entirely absorbed by our bodies and are excreted and passed into wastewater and surface water
5801393 veterinary drugs which are used on livestock and domesticated animals are excreted and passed on to waterways in addition to excretion pharmaceuticals can end up in water systems through drug disposal practices like flushing down toilets or drains
5801394 recent laboratory research has found that small amounts of medication have affected human embryonic kidney cells human blood cells and human breast cancer cells
5801395 the cancer cells proliferated too quickly the kidney cells grew too slowly and the blood cells show biological activity associated with inflammation
5801396 aquatic organisms may be affected differently than people because they live in water and are exposed constantly to any harmful chemicals that may be present because of the differences between humans and aquatic organisms aquatic organisms may be more sensitive than humans to the low levels of pharmaceuticals in water

5801406 the other quality that he has that a lot of the top men in this sport that ive coached in the past havent had is that when he does a skill right and does it well hell do it over and over again he has the determination and dedication to keep at it until it looks good
5801407 when he was a little guy learning the tricks you could see him watching matt doing the big tricks that now hes doing and you could just see it on his face im going to do that one day
5801408 it was a real inspiration for him to see how good matt could make the skills look

5801419 when i was in prison in vietnam i like other of my fellow pows was offered early release by my captors most of us refused because we were bound to our code of conduct which said those who had been captured the earliest had to be released the soonest my friend everett alvarez a brave american of mexican descent had been shot down years before i was and had suffered for his country much more and much longer than i had to leave him behind would have shamed us

5801529 the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it communion to him
5801530 if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives
5801531 a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5801532 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5801533 not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5801534 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5801535 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5801536 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb

5801549 the convention will offer a series of contrasts and comparisons of the mccain record so voters can see how clearly the choice will be in november
5801550 the convention will also introduce senator obama to the country but it will make sure to convey strongly the differences and choices obamas campaign presents with mccains
5801551 for three decades as our energy crisis grew decision making in washington has been rigged against our national interests and the interests of american consumers
5801552 and for almost that long senator mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need and now hes standing with the oil companies in opposing a bipartisan compromise in congress that would expand offshore drilling and at the same time make serious investments in alternative energy to break our dependence on foreign oil when it comes to solving our energy problems john mccain is just more of the same and america cant afford it
5801553 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5801554 he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5801555 they do not feel like theyre slipping in the polls but they just think they need a clear definition of mccain supporting bush economic policies as well as being totally a dc figure
5801556 he needs to do it because if you dont fight back voters think you wont fight for them
5801557 therefore you have to do it to win their support the benefit outweighs the cost
5801558 typically you would want the status quo of this campaign to continue in a pro democrat year in the polls its risky they must have polled this and focused grouped it
5801559 you wouldnt do this if someone close to you got hurt or or died from it

5801654 weve seen refineries pull back because refining hasnt been profitable
5801655 the economic news that continues to come in is all pretty gloomy out there
5801656 if this conflict continues to widen i dont think the market is going to be able to ignore it anymore
5801657 i dont think weve seen the last of iran and israel
5801658 to cope with a world in which terrorists and warlords pose as great a challenge as massed armies a radical revision of military thinking is essential
5801659 in order to make sure this doesnt happen again we have to change the way we conduct our affairs
5801660 we need to change the way we live which is unacceptable or we can change the way they live
5801661 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces
5801662 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5801663 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5801664 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance centre last night was not under the command of coalition forces
5801665 this was an iraqi planned and executed operation without the involvement of the coalition forces an american air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets

5801669 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5801670 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5801671 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5801672 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5801673 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5801674 no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run i will honor senator mccains service just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states of america

5801680 its not an economic model we want to project but project we must
5801681 first for one thing another round of large write offs would as they say end all doubt regarding a u s recession we would record negative gdp for q3 and q4 at minimum most likely for q1 2009 as well
5801682 second youre looking at additional consolidation in investment banking and commercial banking
5801683 third there would be considerable u s government involvement the scope and amount of intervention by the u s treasury and fed u s federal reserve is difficult to specify until the size of the problem is known
5801684 would most likely propel congressionally backed federally directed structural changes in banking mortgage finance securities and financial regulation
5801685 its one thing if the nature of the bailout is another 50 or 100 billion but if it amounts to the takeover of a large bank or fre the american economy would see its biggest changes since the new deal
5801686 these changes would most likely end once and for all the heads the banks win tails the government pays banking system youd most likely see a two tier banking system
5801687 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5801688 simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under
5801689 he rogoff used pretty strong language and i take a slightly different stance losses will be significant but from here to the economys recovery were looking at managed losses
5801690 the fed is ready to provide liquidity the u s treasury is back stopping fannie mae and freddie mac so while the losses could be large the reserve capital in the form of public funds is larger

5801714 the valencia street course is new to formula one so this will present many challenges for the teams for bridgestone we have evaluated the track layout and surface and we will bring the softest tyres in our compound range the soft and super soft this is a street course with many corners although we expect quite high speeds to be attained over the course of a lap as with any street course we expect the grip levels from the circuit to improve over the course of the weekend in valencia in august we should see quite high temperatures so teams will have to be vigilant with their tyre management as we have not raced here previously this should be a learning process for everyone involved and strategy decisions over the race weekend will be interesting

5801717 uhh no women who use iuds arent serial killers you fucking moron life begins at conception and iuds prevent conception most of the time therefore no conception no serial killer serial killer please go back and reread your planned parenthood propaganda more thoroughly cletus
5801718 the iud does little or nothing to interfere with sperm migration or fertilization conception it achieves its birth control effect primarily by preventing the newly conceived human life from implanting in the uterine lining endometrium and is thus an abortifacient
5801719 whatever uncertainty may still exist concerning the actual workings of the iud there is no reasonable doubt that it accomplishes its birth control function as an early abortion agent after conception has occurred and it is a misnomer to call such an action
5801720 any woman who is concerned about the life of the unborn infant will avoid choosing the iud as a method of birth regulation

5801726 every time they legislators do this and they pass on that responsibility to the counties they put pressure on us rather than them taking it
5801727 we have seen it happen again and again and again and i think we are reinforcing bad behavior on the part of the state legislature
5801728 this is only a small kernel of the irresponsible spending that goes on at the state level
5801729 and thats why i am going to vote against giving this money to the schools i feel we have to send a message to the state legislature that this is the priority rather than their irresponsible projects
5801730 we are funding something that rightfully they should be funding we can make a statement and withhold the funds and ultimately the people that suffer then are citizens of this county so presented with two really bad options i will take the lesser of the two evils and appropriate the money

5801736 a year ago we designed a solar module and a manufacturing system to produce it in january we began building a manufacturing facility near portland oregon to start we will build about 25 megawatts of production capacity which represents approximately 200 000 marketable solar panels per year and then grow that capacity to 35 megawatts by improving our system performance and adding work shifts we then plan to begin efforts to scale to 100 megawatts of manufacturing capacity by some time in 2010
5801737 our modules are designed for the electrical utilities scale market where thousands of solar modules are used in each power field we have started bidding projects for utilities and government agencies to install our modules the second part of our target market is the conventional installer and integrator where we have received significant requests for purchases of our modules in 2009 and later
5801738 the electrical market is enormous to keep up with demand the utilities are reaching out for new power production methods that are clean and safe long term these power fields are great investments that can provide a 5 year payback on the average installation and then you have 15 years of cash flow with low operating costs we see this trend picking up significantly and have positioned ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity

5801760 unlawful command influence is the mortal enemy of military justice it is the acid that erodes an accuseds right to receive a fair trial and the publics confidence in the fairness of the system the nature of the military makes its system of justice extremely vulnerable to improper influences and pressures influences and pressures that are systemic in a military command environment
5801761 this is an important case not only for ltcol chessani but for military commanders whose battlefield decisions should not be second guessed by lawyers and for the military justice system as a whole indeed the haditha cases have caused a noticeable erosion of public confidence in our military system of justice affirming the military judges ruling will go a long way to restoring the public perception of fairness in the military courts

5801765 its naive when people think that youre going to have a couple of politicians get together and solve the conflict in the middle east
5801766 its more than naive theres a level of arrogance there
5801767 my belief does not influence my views on foreign policy but at the same time it has clearly given me perspective on the depth of the history of the middle east if youve studied the bible you certainly understand this conflict didnt start in the 1940s it started with isaac and ishmael

5801771 aunque comparten la canasta con otros bienes y servicios muchos con una ponderaci n significativamente mayor en el gasto y con precios que tambi n en muchos casos han crecido menos pueden reconocerse como distintivos del perfil de consumo de la clase media y tal vez ayuden tambi n a explicar su humor social

5801775 algo parecido ocurre con las amplias capas medias no asalariadas o asalariadas fuera de convenio
5801776 la clase media no asalariada o asalariada fuera de convenio tiene en promedio una menor capacidad de defensa del ingreso que los asalariados que negocian colectivamente
5801777 falta mucho todav a pero es un paso importante el hecho de conseguir resultados como este se sumaron muy buenos puntos en donde se pudo hacer mayor diferencia pero hay que continuar con este rendimiento en todas las fechas esta carrera la pudimos cerrar con un triunfo luego de aprovechar el incidente de la largada y a pesar de los ingresos del auto de seguridad y el acoso de adri n chiriano y percaz se acercaron pero pude cuidar el puesto y ganar

5801784 i don t know if it s going to be for these last two preseason games or for sept 7th the date of the regular season opener against the cincinnati bengals but i do know that when i m truly healthy i will be back on the field the ravens have compensated for gaithers absence by primarily using chad slaughter at left tackle with mike kracalik also getting a few reps on the left side the youthful but inexperienced offensive line could use a boost from gaithers return but the tackle said he is not pressing the issue i ve been pushing myself the whole time
5801785 the agreement at firestone marks a new day for workers throughout liberia
5801786 it is also a crucial victory in the global fight for workers rights
5801787 it creates new union jobs including major growth areas like fios it takes a big step forward on health care and brings hundreds of verizon business employees the union rights they deserve
5801788 provides a framework for growth at verizon and a good standard of living with careers for our members
5801789 the involvement and mobilization of tens of thousands of our members made a huge difference in these negotiations all of us together showed our strength our commitment our determination to get the best possible agreement
5801790 the negotiating committee did a hell of a job securing this agreement but they couldnt have done it without the solidarity and discipline of the rank and file
5801791 we want to thank everyone on the docks who made this possible
5801792 wal mart has bullied its workers and managers for years now it wants to bully the political process and the fec should take threats very seriously
5801793 wal mart has shown exactly why our nation needs the employee free choice act we must outlaw the kind of behavior for which wal mart is famous and give workers a free and fair choice on whether to form a union
5801794 there is reason to believe that wal mart stores inc has made prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against senator obamas election to employees who were not in its restricted class in violation of 2 u s c 441b we request that the commission immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and if so to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal election law
5801795 informing employees that it is imperative that the employee free choice act not be enacted and simultaneously that their voting for senator obama and other democrats would lead to its enactment constitutes express advocacy
5801796 the employee free choice act is strongly opposed by wal mart because it would in fact go a long way toward rectifying the imbalance that currently exists between workers seeking to form unions and employers that oppose them currently the law fails to effectively protect workers seeking to organize and employers are able to violate the law with virtual impunity this legislation would allow workers throughout the united states to decide whether or not to form a union if an employer intimidates or obstructs a workers free choice it would incur increased penalties senator obama is a co sponsor of the legislation while his republican opponent senator john mccain opposes the bill and voted against bringing it to the senate floor last year

5801798 when jazz musicians improvise they often play with eyes closed in a distinctive personal style that transcends traditional rules of melody and rhythm
5801799 during which all of a sudden the musician is generating music that has never been heard thought practiced or played before what comes out is completely spontaneous
5801800 jazz is often described as being an extremely individualistic art form you can figure out which jazz musician is playing because one persons improvisation sounds only like him or her
5801801 what we think is happening is when youre telling your own musical story youre shutting down impulses that might impede the flow of novel ideas
5801802 without this type of creativity humans wouldnt have advanced as a species its an integral part of who we are

5801804 there are legions of christians in the film industry and television industry but were just not breaking into the ranks of the big budget movies that hollywood can entrust us with and the only folks to blame there are us christians what is it that were doing that is not allowing us to get there
5801805 we want to turn the traditional business model on its head
5801806 were training tomorrows young filmmakers which means were essentially creating our own competition with the idea that together we can build a marketplace and then we have a viable locational opportunity for all the christians who will be coming up that were training and the audience will begin to look forward to the kinds of movies that we make
5801807 turn the words christian filmmaking into something very positive right now people might say do you really want to see that movie its made by a christian director we want them to say hey weve got to go see this movie its made by a christian director
5801808 what theyre doing offers an outstanding model for how christians should engage the culture
5801809 it is a battle i think just for standards in our culture
5801810 i see advent film group as one step in a much broader effort across our culture many other groups are doing the same thing trying to reform our manners lift the standard of our moral behavior lift the standard of our culture for the future generations

5801828 you have the defending olympic 100 metre champion inside of you you know its going to be a fast race
5801829 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
5801830 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials got to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone
5801831 these include the wetland inventory mapping project sensitive habitat inventory mapping project and the sensitive eco system inventory project
5801832 due to their environmental significance and sensitivity many water based and land based features within the city of kelowna have already been designated as natural environment development permit areas
5801833 overall the proposed amendment would see the removal of 62 properties from the development permit areas while including an additional 686 properties
5801834 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
5801835 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
5801836 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
5801837 i continue to support these initiatives of council but to walk proudly in the city of kelowna i cannot defend the approach taken by council today monday i am willing to deal with any of the consequences as a result of this decision and can only apologize to the citizens for not being able to bring forward a different decision than was reached monday
5801838 approximately 1800 new boat slips will be added over the next five years with 1400 of those for private use in addition there are plans for dock storage for 315 boats with the potential for more
5801839 we found 77 what we called points of interest and narrowed that down to 47 those could be anything from a boat launch to a marina to mooring buoys
5801840 i think this re establishes what some of us on city council have been saying for quite a while that we have a major shortage of facilities for boats im kind of shocked about 40 per cent of the people have some sort of boat which is very eye opening
5801841 just thinking of alternative places of storing trailers i think we really need to be out of the box on that there is the notion of valet service
5801842 i think of schools for example and all the parking lots that are vacant in the summertime maybe the school district could make a deal to rent parking lots and putting some money back into the school system
5801843 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust
5801844 the city will ask the appeal court to clarify whether it is possible to create a trust under common law
5801845 the city will ask the appeal court to rule on whether a charitable trust can be established when land is not gifted the city purchased the land in 1946
5801846 city council is committed to preserving public ownership and public access to the waterfront land and the city hall site
5801847 at the time it wasnt clear if there was damage to the beams its taken some time to determine that and an approximate value
5801848 just for the record i always notice and mentally groan with sensible commas if you

5801851 i have decided not to continue with my news career
5801852 or whether or not the government needs a new mandate
5801853 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc quebecois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately
5801854 liberal leader stephane dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he doesnt have good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
5801855 fixed election date idea more before he put it in
5801856 i want my programme so the rest of you should pay more taxes

5801872 it wasnt really going to work out here the way that we had hoped and he had hoped
5801873 at the same time there are still a couple preseason games left and time before the season opener and i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
5801874 they saw i was disgruntled they saw that me sitting to the side and watching and we know it wasnt going to work out well for either of us
5801875 we made the right decision they allowed me to go and im just happy to know that im leaving with good character
5801876 we are hugely disappointed that the match will be played at a neutral venue
5801877 it was a crucial qualifier because it will be our first and we worked very hard at the fixtures meeting
5801878 but we have a bigger situation at home and it wont matter where we play the players will use this as a bigger motivation against ireland to get a result
5801879 and now were talking about a chance to win the fedex cup
5801880 the tour said they wanted more volatility but are they setting themselves up for a guy like me
5801881 have i had a better year than no but the playoffs arent all about who had the best year its who is playing well in the playoffs the certainly were not the best team in the league but they won the super bowl
5801882 i seem to be the biggest procrastinator in the world when it means something
5801883 its a wonder i ever got married and had kids but you know they give you 42 weeks just because i waited until the last week doesnt bother me im elated to be where im at
5801884 were really proud to represent our country in a difficult situation tomorrow and it will be a special and symbolic game
5801885 nobody can break our will for independence we are alive and russia will not stop us the whole of georgia will look to us and how we perform
5801886 all our travel plans were thrown into chaos but we managed to get to baku and obtain the visas to travel
5801887 we then had to rearrange our travel schedule because the airport was closed and there were no international flights im sure someone in russia thought they would break us down and we wouldnt travel to wales but we made it
5801888 of course we are missing a lot of players and not because of injury we have players who play in russia and they could not get to baku for their visas so they will not play
5801889 our new coach hector cuper hasnt had the chance to meet the players properly in georgia so he does not know them at all
5801890 the squad is not perfect but this gives the youngsters a chance to become a player of the national team

5801898 we signed him to pitch out of the bullpen for us
5801899 ive spoken to some people about his condition this season and hes somebody we looked into as soon as we were a little bit light as far as i know hes healthy and ready to go
5801900 in the majority of his career hes been a starter but he was signed with the understanding that hed pitch out of the bullpen until theres further evaluation and we see where were at
5801901 is the art of building alliances its not contacting everyone you know when you are looking for a new job and asking if they know of any job openings networking starts long before a job search and you probably dont even realize you are doing it
5801902 bill is a non conformist hes a maverick hes a very provocative teacher
5801903 what seems to be the provacateur for all of this
5801904 is the idea that debaters are allowed to strike two judges and in this case there were 5 judges and the fort hays state university team struck two judges who had given them low scores in the past one of them happened to be a black female and that set the thing off
5801905 and were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available
5801906 i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action
5801907 i wish everyone would recognize the importance of these issues and stop to think about the consequences theyre having on real people

5801927 im extremely excited about the chance to be able to coach anaheims top farm team and certainly here in iowa
5801928 i know coming in here there is a real excitement that anaheim has moved their affiliation here certainly based on the success that theyve had in the past with their minor league affiliates hopefully that bodes well for all of us as far as the development of anaheims prospects but also for putting a real competitive team on the ice here in des moines
5801929 i definitely have a familiarity with the players and more importantly with the anaheim way of doing things
5801930 starting from the top anaheim general manager brian burke really has a mandate to develop from within and theyve entrusted me with that opportunity to develop their top players theyve kind of developed a culture within their organization that they are going to play a real strong physical brand of hockey that is entertaining for fans and is a real in your face style of hockey for me thats a fun style of hockey to put across we did that in portland last year and had a lot of success with it
5801931 i was really fortunate in my career that i broke in with the islanders basically when they were in the middle of their stanley cup years
5801932 i was able to come in there and be surrounded by guys that knew what it took to win the professionalism side of it every day the competitive atmosphere that was brought about by al arbour the coach was something that you either sank or swam with them for me that was a great environment to go into and learn the professional side of hockey it is something thats been forged in me and ive carried ever since ive been in hockey 26 years now
5801933 i had always had coaching sort of in my mind
5801934 the sports authority as well as the giants and jets teams feel the experience of coming to a football game is a pleasant one for all fans
5801935 some may say there are only a few fans out of those thousands who attend that misbehave at a game but if they happen to sit next to you then it ruins the experience
5801936 the teams have implemented a zero tolerance policy for season ticket holders who are ejected from the stadium
5801937 ejection of these patrons shall result in the revocation of their season tickets patrons who are not season ticket holders who violate stadium policies while using the tickets of season ticket holders shall be ejected from the stadium the season ticket holder shall receive two written warnings before season tickets are revoked
5801938 giants com benefits sellers through their program because they are protected against losing their tickets
5801939 however if they go through stub hub or any other site then they dont have the same protection
5801940 we already get fans who come in before and after the games who are sloshed from drinking all day long
5801941 i think the rules give fans plenty of time to enjoy themselves before the game
5801942 they need to make sure they are a responsible patron
5801943 there will always be drinking at games even excessive at times it will definitely be a hard one to bite
5801944 i think jets fans will have a harder time than the giants since they like to pound down those beers
5801945 i would be enormously doubtful if that were the case

5802094 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
5802095 the most important thing for me to remember is not to mistake my presence for the event
5802096 the event is the show the event is csi everyone has a responsibility to bring their unique talents and gifts to it and thats what im going to do im going to enter into this with the most positive attitude i can im coming to work with people who are wonderful who have made great television for nine years thats a gift all i can say is that im ready to play
5802097 fishburne will play a former pathologist who is now working as an itinerant college lecturer teaching a course in criminalistics his focus is on understanding criminal behavior how and why people commit acts of violence tendencies he disturbingly sees within himself
5802098 i think it was misreported a little bit in terms of this character having the genetic profile of a serial killer
5802099 in reality there is no such thing from the outset what we really wanted to play with in a dramatic sense is a character who has been able to examine his own genetic profile to a certain extent and find certain complexes and certain clusters of biological facts that he has in common with that is associated with aggressive or criminal behavior thats all it is obviously thats a mouthful its not as simple as saying the genetic profile of a serial killer but its just one of those things thats going to lead this character to interested in the world of violent criminals and criminalistics and forensics its what draws him to it the sense that if you find within yourself certain tendencies and see certain behaviors it lets you wonder how these things turn into murder how they turn into violence how they turn into criminal behavior thats all it is its an underlying element for the character its nothing as simple as hes got the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing
5802100 we had talked about a particular genetic syndrome xyy at an early stage of our story development process
5802101 weve always strived to make sure that csi is as accurate as possible we have a small army of researchers and forensic consultants who work with us our initial steps into figuring out what that particular genetic syndrome was about was not really borne out by the research we changed that aspect of it a little bit but again this is a character still in development thats just the natural course of thing
5802102 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such biological profile if in fact such biological profile exists i dont know im just really excited that im going to be joining this team we have a lot of stuff to work out our last question was what is this characters name we have a lot of stuff to flesh out weve only had an opportunity to sit down with each other face to face one time i think over the next couple weeks well get cracking and really discover what the answers to those questions are all this stuff is discovery for everyone involved
5802103 i wouldnt say my going into weekly television series is actually stepping away from anything
5802104 its another medium in which to work as an actor because i havent done series television since pee wees playhouse its a welcome change its going to be challenging its going to be fun and its going to be exciting
5802105 to be perfectly frank i said to naren and carol mendelsohn when we met here in new york that i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them but im happy to say that the episodes they sent me to look at were really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in and i thought wow thats cool hmmm wow thisll work so im very excited
5802106 were a show that spends a lot of time thinking we dont blow stuff up were not about chasing people down and shooting people and the quality we were looking for was deep intelligence mr fishburne when you look at his work hes always brought that sensibility to the material hes done it was a perfect fit for csi
5802107 about 8 420 people in the united states are expected to die of melanoma during 2008 the death rate has been stable since the 1990s for those older than 50 and has been dropping in those younger than 50
5802108 the american academy of dermatology for decades has kept up a drumbeat on behalf of faith in an epidemic of melanoma and rays of the sun as the major cause of it at the same time that it has flayed incessantly the tanning bed industry although the organization is termed an academy never has it presented in fashion academic a whit of evidence available readily contrary to its position entrenched namely there is no epidemic of melanoma and that tanning beds have not been proven to be a cause direct of melanoma

5802158 im happy now but tomorrow im going to be depressed again and shoot somebody between the eyes
5802159 fame must be grand for barack obama but is he ready to lead in tough times
5802160 is one of the few places where the owners of large corporations share activities out on the streets with their own employees
5802161 london paris and other cities have taken this idea much further but they started with temporary street closures
5802162 once you get out of the mind set of all cars all the time all sorts of possibilities open up
5802163 how do we accommodate them as they move around the city the obvious answer is to use our limited space more efficiently by freeing up more of it for pedestrians and cyclists and if you transform a crowded traffic choked environment to one thats more beautiful more user friendly it becomes a destination and thats good for neighborhood merchants
5802164 it is particularly pleasing to be able to publish such a ground breaking new series during the uks 2008 national year of reading there is the whole the 39 clues experience for committed readers to enjoy while the collectible cards and the continuously unfolding online game may well bring children who are not so keen on reading back to books
5802165 we in the south pacific and pacific island countries in particular take democracy very seriously that is why we believe we cannot sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded we look forward to the discussion that will now occur minus fiji in niue on how this matter should be handled in future
5802166 i think that it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend the forum it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer for the commitments that have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states
5802167 if someone is not prepared to come and be accountable for breaking commitments given to leaders a year ago that in itself speaks volumes so i expect that there will be a robust outcome from the forum
5802168 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the pacific forum i personally intervened to ensure transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so they could be accountable to the forum leaders for commitments given last year
5802169 microsoft already has too much we cant let it win anymore
5802170 facilitate the full withdrawal of other foreign forces from somalia and help create the conditions for lasting peace and stability there
5802171 i think hed be a great choice i mean hes someone who has got 20 plus years of public experience both as a city councilmember a mayor a lieutenant governor a governor hes really where the rubber hits the road in terms of delivering government services hes a man of deep faith he served as a missionary in honduras he brings i think a life experience and a level of judgment to the position that quite honestly i think would be a great addition to the obama ticket
5802172 it wasnt even nerve wracking it was just miserable its not like youre on the phone with the kids all day because youve told them over the past year everything youve had to tell them we had a couple kids say they were going to turn their phones off i didnt talk to alex meyer until after midnight
5802173 with the alex meyer deal the first positive thing wed heard was that afternoon on the ba blog
5802174 were excited but the secs a huge adjustment for anybody no matter how talented you are
5802175 i think mark prior had an era over 5 00 his freshman year at vanderbilt actually 4 59 and he was one of the best pitchers in the history of college baseball his junior year so you cant expect to come in and dominate right away
5802176 i feel pretty good when you recruit those kids though you want to get them all
5802177 its a tough tough system i was irritated when westmoreland signed but i was more irritated with the situation than anyone else its a situation where that type of money given to a kid like him can only be given when its too late for us and that stinks youve got no way of making that up no way at all in his case it came down to the very end
5802178 when the recruiting coordinator is doing most of the visiting with the parents i dont know that you can discount it but i dont think thats the ultimate factor
5802179 i think the ultimate factor is the amount of money and scholarships offered by the professional clubs
5802180 those are the kind of guys that go to school we lost seven guys in 15 years prior to a pretty good track record then all of a sudden to lose four and hatchet your recruiting class
5802181 i guess it says how healthy major league baseball is and how many resources they have but it sure does change the way your approach it we felt solid to get academic guys who are outstanding college players and wouldnt be in the top two or three rounds of the draft who had a chance to come in and be major impact guys as freshmen and be first or second or third round picks in three years it leaves you in a place where you can have no strategy at this late a date it doesnt matter how hard you worked how much money you spent how much time you spent in the recruiting process it leaves you with nothing
5802182 we detected an error dont worry though weve been notified and were on it
5802183 its one of the hardest things ive ever done but its been very very interesting
5802184 enormous challenge it might be called a quick read but its been far from a quick write for me
5802185 there was about a fist size tumor inside of my rib cage
5802186 just marching onto the field performing the show and hearing the crowd go ahhh just that sound and the lights and the emotion im getting shivers just talking about it
5802187 any kind of shooting toward mexican territory is rejected by the mexican government they should have waited for response of the mexican authorities
5802188 bill perkins d manhattan and eric adams d brooklyn unveiled the measure yesterday at a news conference they joined military families speak out an anti war organization in front of the armed forces recruiting station in times square however perkins said neither he nor adams has found any republican co sponsors so far for the legislation practically a requirement in a gop controlled senate nor have they found a potential sponsor in the democratic led assembly perkins said the legislation is still in its infancy both senators are facing re election in november along with the rest of the legislature
5802189 is america finished respected public intellectuals think tank theorists and members of the media elite seem to think so the scare headline in a recent new york times magazine cover story by parag khanna titled waving goodbye to hegemony asks who shrunk the superpower almost daily learned authors proclaim the end of the american era as the title of a 2002 book by charles kupchan put it and instruct us that the rise of china and india the reawakening of putins russia and the expansion of the european union signal a profound shift in geopolitical power that will retire once and for all the burden of american exceptionalism
5802190 last weekends mccain obama protodebate made it clear why obama wont keep his promise to debate mccain
5802191 barack obama seems to have gotten the message about his message in the past few days amid growing concerns among democratic allies obama has begun campaigning in a different gear one that is more aggressive in attacking john mccain and more focused on the economic concerns of struggling americans
5802192 im very proud of my son and what he was doing said dan mcguire 45 of mashpee
5802193 i cant leave my brothers he reportedly told his mother who is quoted saying her son died doing what he always wanted to do
5802194 if cold war ii is coming who started it if not us
5802195 should america admit ukraine into nato yalta vacation resort of the czars will be a nato port and sevastopol traditional home of the russian black sea fleet will become a naval base for the u s sixth fleet this is altogether a bridge too far
5802196 barack obama said he would consider embracing a single payer health care system beloved by liberals as his plan for broader coverage evolves over time if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system obama told some 1 800 people at a town hall style meeting on the economy
5802197 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5802198 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5802199 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5802200 as we look forward into the second half of the year we see continued pressure on our markets
5802201 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
5802202 behalve dat het voor ons gezin een leerzame ervaring is kunnen we hiermee ook aandacht vragen voor de voedselbank
5802203 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
5802204 hemos venido siguiendo el desarrollo del petr leo y el gas natural en la selva amaz nica desde 2004 y el panorama ha cambiado ante nuestros ojos
5802205 cuando miras donde se ubican los bloques de petr leo y gas natural gas estos se superponen perfectamente encima de los lugares con mayor diversidad casi a prop sito y este es quiz s el lugar con mayor biodiversidad en el planeta
5802206 la verdadera preocupaci n es cuando la exploraci n tiene xito y una zona entra en la fase de desarrollo porque ah es cuando entran las carreteras perforaciones y tuber as
5802207 ellos no est n mirando el panorama general de lo que ocurrir a si hay un mont n de proyectos realiz ndose al mismo tiempo
5802208 t podr as tener cada empresa pensando que ellos est n siendo relativamente responsables y manteniendo sus propias redes de carreteras bajo control y as sucesivamente pero qu sucede cuando tienes otros 15 proyectos alrededor tuyo de repente cuando se mira al panorama general tienes una extensa red de carreteras
5802209 la forma como la explotaci n petrolera se est llevando a cabo en la zona occidental del amazonas es una burda violaci n de los derechos de los pueblos ind genas de la regi n
5802210 los acuerdos internacionales y las leyes interamericanas de derechos humanos reconocen el derecho que los pueblos ind genas tienen sobre sus tierras y proh be expresamente el otorgamiento de concesiones para explotar los recursos naturales en sus territorios sin el libre previo e informado consentimiento
5802211 asuma su responsabilidad de proteger a los ciudadanos en sus bienes y en sus personas

5802214 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5802215 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5802216 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our

5802222 have you ever read colsons book parts of it familiar with parts of it did you get it from colson second hand
5802223 by attracting a production company to come in and utilize them and get a little extra bang for our buck
5802224 its not as easy as saying hey weve got a building come blow it up
5802225 it was much easier when we had the tv show walker texas ranger here because we did that kind of thing all the time
5802226 only about 50 per cent of women now take their husbands name
5802227 no there is no way youd just invite identity fraud
5802228 and what happens down the line our great great grandchildren could have been lumbered with eight surnames
5802229 no the surname that goes on the birth certificate of the children i bore is going to be my surname

5802231 but wouldnt it be nice for us all to have the same name

5802242 it can translate for large fleet owners into millions of dollars of fuel savings
5802243 its good for the environment it helps the bottom line it provides adaptive suspension capabilities we could eventually make a big impact

5802245 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought
5802246 after finding this kind of intelligence in apes many people thought it had developed once in one evolutionary line with humans at the end the bird studies show it has developed at least twice
5802247 cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells warren when a girl is ready to get married
5802248 for the consumer at the end of the day what really matters is what can i do with the phone
5802249 if android allows you to do things you cant do otherwise and its better then consumers will start to say i know what this is and i want it thats going to be hard to get to that point
5802250 to me the key variable is really not so much android its your big mobile phone operators that command most of the market share and how are they going to act and react
5802251 i think the idea behind android is a good one the idea of having an open platform but at the same time phones are different from computers most people dont realize their phone has an os on it much less care about what os it has
5802252 really the success of a platform boils down to the developers
5802253 when youre sitting at zero handsets developers have to make their bets
5802254 one would think that google with their very broad reach and very good branding would be at lots of advantages with respect to distribution their open nature might mean they have a pretty good rev share model in place for the developers
5802255 i think a lot of the developers are betting that its worth playing with the android platform
5802256 it may as well be the only phone in the world if youre google youve got to match that and if not do better be cheaper one or the other
5802257 you may have noticed that we started running a test of display ads on select pages of the youtube mobile site in the u s and japan
5802258 this is our first step in testing mobile advertising for youtube it will give you a new way to interact with content on the go while allowing us to learn how video viewers engage with mobile advertising our test advertisers will also have an additional branding tool at their disposal and the opportunity to reach the millions of people who visit youtube every day on their phones
5802259 theyre being aggressive because theyre looking for the killer app for video ads theyre just trying a lot of different things this is the newest trial
5802260 the problem is that the screen size on a mobile device is going to kill google
5802261 theyre still struggling with finding a way to make video ads work on a pc size screen now theyre saying they need to test what will work on a small screen its an added degree of difficulty all of the challenges facing the monetization of video on the pc are just exacerbated on the mobile device
5802262 at youtube we are constantly testing new ways to deliver the kinds of ads that contribute to the user experience while making the most sense for advertisers and weve learned a lot about what works for youtube and what doesnt
5802263 let one into your life today and get a feel for what it can do
5802264 ubuntu has a huge user base and substantial community support around the world we think the passion these users have for linux and the open source movement generally will be important in helping the linux foundation to accelerate the uptake of linux in organizations of all size
5802265 so it seemed logical for us to join the other major vendors supporting the linux foundation at this time
5802266 even though canonical and ubuntu have been participating in our activities for the last few years the direct association with them means well have closer coordination across their organization it also means they see enough value in what we do to financially support it
5802267 to sensually stage the poetry of water within the overall concept bath
5802268 we are pleased to add the company to our portfolio of fashion brands and look forward to working with the brand for years to come
5802269 voice however the park was packed despite of the breeze and cold weather we left right during the intermission to japan town it took us longer to get there than it should had been coz of the traffic ugh we hang out around there took pictures went to the 1 store ate crepes and went home it was my bros first time eating crepe he had turkey and tuna crepe and i had strawberry kiwi one too bad we were so hungry that made us forgetful to take the pictures something happened on sunday night that really pissed me off and had caused me losing my atm card the worst thing is i didnt realize it until yesterday evening when i was having dinner with my bro maybe u would wonder how the pissed me off incident related to me losing my atm card i dont want to say it in detail but i can give the headlines sometimes people are just not what they claim they are someone claimed hes a priest and wanted to help my bro with something he insisted to meet us that night and came to my place of course i refused because i dont like someone i dont know come and explore my small tiny castle told my bro to call him back to meet him at starbucks west portal i was very suspicious about this priests way of insisting it is more like pushing i kept telling my bro that i felt something was not right about this guy who claimed himself as a priest but bro told me not to be too suspicious well living here for almost 9 years i can usually feel if theres something fishy about someone or something especially if one of the characteristics is being too pushy my suspicion came true lets make the story short i got really pissed off but still trying to hold my anger considering i was in a public place and there were many people around later that night i told my bro
5802270 it depends on what what sort of spring you get but more often than not you get a good supply of plums
5802271 it will impact the commercial farms who have acres of each variety
5802272 this year because plums have been so poor we have had to import plums from italy to produce the products that last year we would have made with british fruit
5802273 im really excited to have both young ladies as captains
5802274 its really important to have captains that are capable of leading both on and off of the court they both have a strong work ethic and are capable of getting the job done alex is a quiet leader and arlee is very vocal they represent the direction that this program is head in
5802275 il serait hors de propos dutiliser cet v nement pour attiser des pol miques partisanes a ces hommes qui sont morts ou ont t bless s pour d fendre notre libert nous devons de continuer le combat

5802280 la france doit renoncer cette aventure et le pr sident de la r publique convoquer le parlement de toute urgence pour engager un d bat et un vote dans le cas contraire le pr sident de la r publique et son gouvernement seront comptables de vies perdues devant les fran ais

5802284 nous soutenons le pr sident de la r publique et le gouvernement dans leur volont de continuer de combattre juste contre le terrorisme en afghanistan
5802285 le renforcement de la pr sence militaire fran aise sur le terrain tait et reste n cessaire afin que la menace terroriste soit radiqu e et que lafghanistan puisse un jour sortir de lobscurantisme dans lequel lont entra n les talibans
5802286 la pr sence militaire fran aise en afghanistan doit cesser
5802287 les commissions comp tentes du parlement soient r unies en urgence pour tre inform es des circonstances exactes de cette trag die
5802288 la strat gie conduite par les etats unis dont nous ne sommes que les suppl tifs m ne un bourbier sans issue la france doit obtenir le changement radical de cette strat gie comme elle lavait timidement demand en marge du sommet de bucarest ou alors retirer ses troupes
5802289 also of interest perhaps more narrowly the wolves invited several bloggers including those who unlike us dont work for the mainstream media to participate on the conference call thats not unheard of but it is interesting as we move forward
5802290 me and my new girlfriend audrina we are deeply in love you can see naked photos of her here
5802291 if they came to your house and shot your dogs dead how can i trust them
5802292 we also have been preparing further assistance for the people of georgia as further needs are identified in the days and weeks to come
5802293 we are prepared to help with more than emergency needs
5802294 we are looking ahead to longer term reconstruction and development programs that will help the people of georgia recover rebuild and thrive in the aftermath of this conflict
5802295 the cessation of hostilities announced by moscow has not yet reflected particularly into any improvement in terms of access for humanitarian aid workers
5802296 media crackling in favor of hezbollah and the shiite community
5802297 the salafi movement totally rejects this document and who signed it has no right to claim belonging to the salafi movement or representing it
5802298 this document is harmful to the sunni community and would end up in vain god willing
5802299 those who signed it have no influence and whoever wants to defuse tension should talk to forces that do exist
5802300 hvis ikke det havde v ret rentabelt stod jeg ikke her i dag
5802301 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5802302 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5802303 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5802304 separated for the moment no plans for divorce at this time
5802305 bottomless inky black is the deep pit truly a place to be feared
5802306 f r familien wie auch f r die kinder in china ist das mehr eine gro e ehre
5802307 vi mener det er tragisk at et folkek rt arrangement som ol er blevet s big business at man trods protester v lger at holde ol i kina med de menneskelige tragedier det medf lger
5802308 opg relsen for uge 33 er ikke ensbetydende med at danskere er blevet bedre til at hacke eller at vi er blevet en nation med skumlere tanker end tidligere
5802309 det er helt tilf ldigt der er ikke noget specielt i den uge overhovedet de f procenters udsving er helt normalt
5802310 vi ligger i snit p to procent n r vi har en uge som denne hvor vi er oppe p over fem procent s er det h jst sandsynligt en orm der ender p det danske forskningsnet s virker det som om det er danske adresser der angriber danske adresser
5802311 de handlede nemlig om alt fra at danskerne var de bedste hackere i europa til at danmark var et hacker paradis
5802312 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5802313 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5802314 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5802315 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5802316 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5802317 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5802318 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional us1 billion 1 15 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5802319 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5802320 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5802321 our director of rugby dai young has been talking to warren to see what wales want to do but jamie has definitely trained at 12
5802322 he is a big strong ball carrying centre but hes also got good foot speed and skills so he is a good choice
5802323 he can cover 15 and wing too but we are just getting him used to playing at 12 with his timing and he is looking good
5802324 if we had won anything there would be pressure to back it up but there are still points to prove in the areas we want to improve on
5802325 we have got to put our heads down because we have got a very tough start
5802326 jackson lewis got it because they recognized that we needed to find some alternative to billing by the hour they actually brought it up before we did
5802327 there is now light at the end of the commodity price spike tunnel as a number of factors that had conspired to boost commodity prices have now reversed
5802328 the dollar has been strengthening against a number of world currencies in recent weeks including robust currencies such as the euro and yen
5802329 that has helped moderate the price of oil and its derivatives moreover the world is now edging toward global recession defined by the international monetary fund as a situation in which the world is expanding at a 3 percent rate or less the slowing global economy will continue to place downward pressure on commodity prices ushering in a period of greater optimism
5802330 for contractors this means that long awaited relief from surging commodity prices may be at hand if not this year then next
5802331 that will permit many suspended commercial and industrial projects to move ahead which should make 2009 a stronger environment for new commercial starts than many have been anticipating
5802332 building a business case for geospatial information technology a practitioners guide to financial and strategic analysis
5802333 their active work was as illegal operatives the geographic operations of the mukaseis were very extensive they performed tasks for the motherland on several continents

5802335 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces
5802336 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5802337 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5802338 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance centre last night was not under the command of coalition forces
5802339 this was an iraqi planned and executed operation without the involvement of the coalition forces an american air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets
5802340 that begger abhinav men what kya re he done us proud no so much we all wanting gold gold gold no and not getting only no what he shoots men solid only yeah i know him from his look only one day he is going to win gold
5802341 his industrialist father has afforded him a shooting range in the backyard of his sprawling house complete with a computerised target transportation system he has seven rifles top of the line ammunition and other shooting gear on which he spends rs10 million annually how many indians can afford this
5802342 also add a tragic reminder that k d jadhav the first indian to win a n olympic bronze in 1952 died in penury it speaks of a low priority that india gives to sports and sportsmen
5802343 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5802344 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5802345 whenever economies sour politicians blame speculators but on occasion they are right to do so speculators did wreak havoc in 1630s holland 1720s france and in the american stock market in 1929 that crash led to the great depression and 60 years of tight controls on speculation
5802346 she came way before c sar ch vez way before dolores huerta way before martin luther king jr way before the civil rights movement
5802347 she was a woman people attempted to write out of history
5802348 emma was a brilliant and eloquent orator organizer and human being who cared so deeply about the injustice others suffered
5802349 a lot of people are known in history for fighting against injustice that affected them directly emma fought for injustices that never affected her
5802350 she was a sensitive person who couldnt bear to see human suffering
5802351 and the injustices against the poor then were so pervasive
5802352 for all the lost opportunities to make use of a genius we never really tapped her at her best
5802353 used the gifts that she had her intelligence her voice her ability to reach people
5802354 social security unemployment insurance a minimum wage unions the right to a weekend all the things we take for granted
5802355 she dared to marry a white man they just hated her the interesting thing is that some of the tremendous anger dissipated after they divorced
5802356 these people were already starving and they were being asked to live on half
5802357 she had to be an incredibly persuasive person to talk them into a strike
5802358 there were 12 000 shellers it was the citys main industry she was voted strike director at 22 she negotiated with owners she inspired people she was fearless in less than two months they had won the strike
5802359 at the end the leaves of hope begin to sprout on the pecan trees
5802360 she was both feared and hated by much of the working establishment in san antonio
5802361 she was forced to leave her extended family and this community that was home to her and beloved to her

5802366 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5802367 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5802368 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5802369 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5802370 prevent weapons smuggling and members of foreign terrorist organisations from entering russia
5802371 you can probably judge objectively for yourselves the state of georgian democracy and who is trying to wreck it
5802372 lay offs are in progress in asbury i know for sure i was one of em 8 19 2008 11 06 am
5802373 cherry hill employees got an e mail today that a rep from the employee assistance program would be on hand today to meet with employees how nice of them
5802374 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
5802375 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5802376 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5802377 but sometimes you have to feel it like in star wars when luke flies a plane well the plane is telling me that its going to get much worse
5802378 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just
5802379 what weve noticed in recent operations is a greater capacity from the taliban to organise and manoeuvre and as we saw in this incident they dont seem to have any problems securing ammunition
5802380 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5802381 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5802382 san francisco pacific gas amp electric has inked deals with optisolar and sunpower to establish 800 megawatts of solar farms in california which could become the worlds largest set of grid tied photovoltaic installations the new plants would provide 1 65 billion kilowatt hours each year enough to serve nearly 250 000 homes according to jack keenan ceo and senior vice president of pg amp e
5802383 it might not register that its really land at this point
5802384 most of the damage has really been limited to the heavy rainfall
5802385 street flooding downed power lines downed trees that kind of event
5802386 developing an entrepreneurial mindset is valuable for all students as they develop their career goals fostering that mindset is a benefit to the students as well as to the communities and businesses in which they work

5802389 they bring them to the er where else do you go
5802390 home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in now thats the emergency room
5802391 but right now there is no movement toward creating more special units to deal with these psychological issues
5802392 its hard for the existing facilities to address the need
5802393 there will be more alzheimers and other age related dementias we know we are going to need more options as people age
5802394 to help the patient tolerate frustration to feel pleasant to be alert to be able to interact with others and sleep well
5802395 we expect facilities that refer us their patients to accept them back
5802396 they cut back on expensive medications their homes are too hot because they wont turn on air conditioning
5802397 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
5802398 collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health for example in last octobers throne speech i listened as the topic of health care was almost completely ignored by our conservative government
5802399 not to be outdone the liberal party of canada recently sent out a questionnaire based on what they identified as todays issues of crucial significance
5802400 of 16 questions in their poll not one question related to health care
5802401 if our governments are unable to fund the education of the number of doctors we need we must consider alternatives public private partnerships are used in such circumstances to build infrastructure including roads bridges and hospitals
5802402 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventive medicine
5802403 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5802404 sen lucio was twisting bending and breaking arms to get people to support his son
5802405 i had lobbyists tell me they wanted to help gonzales but the senator was pressuring them
5802406 obviously name recognition helped a lot but i think money was the single biggest factor
5802407 i have never put any pressure on anyone to contribute to me or my sons campaign
5802408 couldnt raise very much money in austin so they blamed me for their inability to do so
5802409 as a first time candidate i have no history personally
5802410 no one has ever asked me to take a stand on issues
5802411 many democrats in the valley have noticed that the senator always sides with the republican agenda
5802412 rep solis never had an open door policy with these groups
5802413 i would absolutely encourage him to avoid any conflicts of interest in his private business work
5802414 he would have to evaluate his business affairs very closely
5802415 there are no ethical issues in going before a local government

5802439 ive been eating my own produce all summer my goal is to grow everything i eat
5802440 its just a baby garden but its fantastic for being in its first year
5802441 one of the great surprises has been how densely plant systems want to live together
5802442 they want to cuddle up when theyre close they grow better
5802443 when i first came to this neighborhood people thought i was crazy shes tearing up her grass
5802444 now theyre asking me how can i get rid of my grass
5802445 im trying to see how self sufficient a homestead i can establish
5802446 she suggested species of fruit trees and where to put them
5802447 mary rose is unusual in that she took the design and implemented it herself
5802448 last year i thought why shouldnt strawberries be in a container all winter well of course they died i just try all kinds of weird stuff and see what works and if it doesnt work stick a hosta on it
5802449 people think fruit trees are chemically dependent but that might not be true
5802450 people ask how i control pests ive never really had any but im really tolerant
5802451 the sunflowers bring in wasps which doesnt sound good but they eat the worms that eat the cauliflower
5802452 i weed very little i have no grass to mow i spend 15 minutes watering its a lot less work than my old garden
5802453 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5802454 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propegated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy the identification of a stem cell line with o blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
5802455 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
5802456 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
5802457 like so many classic marvel characters magneto has to grapple with the typical problems of any scrawny outsider family problems schoolyard bullies and first crushes but every little conflict takes on a terrifying new dimension as the scope and inexorable advance of the nazi menace becomes clearer
5802458 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5802459 still no more news on grl founder james powderly at this point
5802460 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
5802461 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet
5802462 last night i was listening to an art bell rerun maybe 2001 where he was talking to this guy bugs
5802463 theres something almost cathartic about seeing something in a public forum that weve all experienc
5802464 40 you seriously believe that its only civil disobedience if its directed at ones own governmen
5802465 i dont think mccain wants to open up this can of worms id bet he wishes it would all go away i

5802469 ele dunga j devia ter ca do falar da queda do dunga depois da derrota para a argentina f cil eu j achava antes desses epis dios que o dunga era um t cnico que precisava melhorar muito o seu desempenho
5802470 eu concordo em muitas coisas com o deputado chinaglia mas n o nesse caso eu acho que se deve dar outra chance ao dunga de continuar na sele o n o foi um fracasso total foi uma derrota para a argentina
5802471 se tivesse perdido para um advers rio menor a sim o dunga deveria sair
5802472 keep it at the normal speed please nicole all the others are looking at you
5802473 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous lover brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5802474 miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse
5802475 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5802476 he can think what the hell he likes if he thinks i am going he is allowed to have his own opinion
5802477 i already had a row with rex there purely because he was getting stuck into you sara
5802478 he is so up his own arse that he thinks everyone loves him so they will love nicole as well
5802479 this installation at denver international airport fits with our greenprint denver action agenda for sustainability and our pledge to do all that we can to reduce our carbon footprint
5802480 we are proud to have such a large and prominently placed solar power system at dia this installation is both a symbol and a practical example of the citys commitment to renewable energy
5802481 why didnt you believe me why were you so sure in making me believe i wasnt up
5802482 its just people that arent in the group thats all it is its pretty obvious
5802483 what it is to be a gentleman i am trying to lead by example if you will there are a couple things that make up a gentleman a gentleman is diverse a gentleman is patient a gentleman understands the strengths of dressing for the occasion a gentleman knows how to treat a lady i say a lady not a woman because there are some women that dont demand respect but a lady demands respect at all times and it is to be shown respect at all times
5802484 straight up and down i thought it was gonna suck
5802485 quality record one that i didnt think she was going to be able to pull off again i will admit that straight up and down i had to eat my words i tried to call her and apologize for the assumption miss lindsay lohan i apologize if you are watching i am sorry there we go
5802486 this solution contains no resources scoped for a web application and cannot be deployed to a particular web application
5802487 i think hes the best in the game at getting in trouble and then getting out of it
5802488 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5802489 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5802490 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5802491 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5802492 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5802493 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5802494 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5802495 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5802496 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5802497 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5802498 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5802499 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5802500 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought
5802501 after finding this kind of intelligence in apes many people thought it had developed once in one evolutionary line with humans at the end the bird studies show it has developed at least twice
5802502 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5802503 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5802504 all the evidence so far indicates that these qualitative differences in nutrition are causal in determining caste though were missing the final link in order to determine if it was casual
5802505 there are some cases where nature completely wins out but all of this is telling us theres a nice interaction between nature and nurture across most social insects
5802506 the benefit to the colony in having the nurture part is that it allows flexibility
5802507 they can quickly and easily change what caste theyre producing to fit their environment better but having the nature component benefits the individual because it can bias its development toward becoming reproductive its a balance between what the individual wants versus what the colony wants
5802508 i was upset about the part of me being sold for 2 million
5802509 at times like this nobody is trying to sell me i could have come out and said oh yeah cam got bought out but i didnt go that route they just gotta watch me move we gonna make it hot
5802510 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
5802511 i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up
5802512 street kids united by loyalty and loot goons and n as getting it
5802513 i got a chance to learn a lot and be around cam and jim and watch us the diplomats one of the greatest movements and still one of the greatest movements doing this thing today i know the ins and outs of what it takes to build a powerful movement i know the things that got us to the points where we needed to be then i know some of the things that was holding us back i get to work around the things i need to work around jim has byrd gang i have the skull gang and freekey zekey has 730
5802514 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together
5802515 at first people kinda looked at us like damn whats going on
5802516 they looking at us like were disloyal but as the time went by its kinda like what we gonna do just die out because the dude that was supposed to be the boss and the head of the table decided to disappear that means we would have vanished along with that we from harlem baby we hustlers were gonna stay afloat were not even floating right now were surfing we not even surfing im the ocean
5802517 i threw up chocolate milk all over the floor mom
5802518 more than sixty people turned out for the first meeting
5802519 we had a full house and needed to set up chairs out in the parking lot behind the store we had the meeting under the stars everyone was participating and asked lots of questions they all seemed to enjoy working together toward creating positive change
5802520 by changing ourselves as individuals and learning how to tap into the higher vibrations of love and peace
5802521 we can change the collective energies of the world around us by becoming peace filled and loving each one of us can help create a world of peace and love but we have a lot of work to do so please come on down and help us
5802522 august 19 that is the day we shall all release a new album in a show of solidarity

5802575 this move didnt come out of the void but after many meetings away from media between representatives of hezbollah and some salafist groups
5802576 but we have some reservations concerning the attack against the sunnis in may

5802584 when we heard that the palliative care department needed work and updating to make families and children more comfortable
5802585 it goes without question that we chose to direct the money towards refurbishing it this year
5802586 libraries are designed not to unduly restrict information but to make it available to an interested public
5802587 its a great opportunity to pick up some very simple all raw cooking
5802588 its absolutely delicious and completely health related people get a lot of information about the health benefits of the herbs i use and their therapeutic use thats a big part of my classes
5802589 in addition to the program on indian cuisine with gigi cohen norene gilletz a kosher cookbook author came to the library this july to share some of her recipes for healthy summer salads the community has responded with a lot of interest to this type of program
5802590 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5802591 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5802592 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5802593 i dont see that the city would need to do any particular studies in this area
5802594 the city has many locations within the city that are within that distance from power lines and if any studies are being undertaken it would be by hydro quebec at a provincial level and they would be implementing their own plans
5802595 i think the city had an obligation to consult hydro quebec and to get a clear ruling a clear guideline as to what was allowed within that hydro right of way within the hydro servitude
5802596 there are no guidelines healthwise from health canada from any department that we know of that says that this shouldnt happen
5802597 so at that point the city is looking at the interest of the city we considered it to be what the residents of the area want we considered it to be a logical development for the city to attract young families to c te st luc in affordable new housing
5802598 if you ask for a certain amount of space that is essential and needed you are building slums
5802599 this is exactly what were doing please lets stop building slums lets recognize the fact that hydro is not our friend please think it over
5802600 our vision for this event is to celebrate community from an environmental perspective
5802601 last year country en ville was the first zero waste public activity in montreal
5802602 we are going to apply the same principle this year
5802603 we also want to increase awareness of the beauty of parks in ndg
5802604 ndg has such beautiful urban green spaces we want to encourage the community to enjoy them
5802605 im the ndg guy and another member grew up here so i guess we qualify as produits du terroir
5802606 since the end of sunday in the park its pretty rare to have anything like that in ndg so im happy we can fit it in
5802607 i always look forward to singing in front of all those familiar faces the event itself is a great way to share ideas in a captivating manner and i really enjoyed myself last year
5802608 we thought it was important to include them because the by election is a big deal for the community

5802619 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5802620 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5802621 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5802622 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5802623 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5802624 i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5802625 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional us1 billion 1 15 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5802626 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5802627 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics

5802649 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces
5802650 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5802651 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5802652 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance centre last night was not under the command of coalition forces
5802653 this was an iraqi planned and executed operation without the involvement of the coalition forces an american air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets

5802657 i thought for the first time john mccain was revealing a lot of his personal side you know he doesnt like to talk about when he was a pow or for that matter his religion
5802658 when i was in prison in vietnam i like other of my fellow pows was offered early release by my captors most of us refused because we were bound to our code of conduct which said those who had been captured the earliest had to be released the soonest my friend everett alvarez a brave american of mexican descent had been shot down years before i was and had suffered for his country much more and much longer than i had to leave him behind would have shamed us
5802659 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5802665 wahai sekalian manusia sesungguhnya saya adalah pesuruh allah kepada kamu sekelian tuhan yang memiliki seluruh langit dan bumi tidak ada tuhan melainkan dia yang menghidupkan dan mematikan berimanlah kamu dengan allah dan rasulnya nabi yang ummi yang telah beriman dengan allah dan kalimahnya turutlah kamu sekalian kepadanya moga moga kamu mendapat petunjuk
5802666 sebelumnya kamu tidaklah mengetahui apakah al kitab al quran dan tidak pula mengetahui apakah iman itu tetapi kami menjadikan al quran itu cahaya yang kami beri petunjuk dengannya siapa yang kami kehendaki di antara hamba kami dan sesungguhnya kami benar benar memberi petunjuk kepada jalan yang lurus iaitu jalan allah yang kepunyaannya segala apa apa yang ada di langit dan apa yang di bumi ingatlah bahawa kepada allahlah kembali semua urusan
5802667 demikianlah supaya kami perkuat hati mu dengannya dan kami menurunkannya dan membacakannya kelompok demi kelompok tidaklah orang orang kafir itu datang kepadamu membawa sesuatu yang ganjil melainkan kami datangkan kepada mu suatu yang benar dan yang paling baik penjelasannya
5802668 jika seutas tali pengikat unta hilang pun dari jagaan saya saya akan dapatinya dalam al quran
5802669 demi allah kalau mereka itu enggan menunaikan kepada ku seutas tali pengikat unta 3 slide 4 antara semalam hari ini seperti yang telah ditunaikan kepada rasulullah saw pasti aku akan perangi mereka selagi pedang masih berada di tangan ku
5802670 dan janganlan kamu bertelagah nescaya kamu akan gagal dan hilang kekuatanmu dan bersabarlah sesungguhnya allah beserta orang orang yang sabar
5802671 tidak sesat sesuatu kaum itu selepas mereka mendapat hidayat kecuali oleh kerana mereka suka bertengkar
5802672 dan jika kami hendak membinasakan negeri maka kami perintahkan kepada orang orang yang hidup mewah di negeri itu supaya mentaati allah tetapi mereka melakukan kedurhakaan dalam negeri itu maka sudah sepatutnya berlaku terhadapnya ketentuan kami dan kemudian kami hancurkan negeri itu sehancur hancurnya
5802673 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu ambil menjadi teman kepercayaan mu orang orang yang di luar kalangan mu kerana mereka tidak henti hentinya menimbulkan kemudharatan bagi mu mereka menyukai apa yang menyusahkan kamu telah nyata kebencian dari mulut mereka dan apa yang disembunyikan oleh hati mereka adalah lebih besar lagi sungguh telah kami terangkan kepada mu ayat ayat kami jika kamu mahu memahaminya
5802674 dan sesungguhnya kami jadikan untuk isi neraka jahannam kebanyakan dari jin dan manusia mereka mempunyai hati tetapi tidak di pergunakannya untuk memahami ayat ayat allah dan mereka mempunyai mata tetapi tidak di pergunakannnya untuk melihat tanda tanda kekuasaan allah dan mereka mempunyai telinga tetapi tidak dipergunakan untuk mendengar ayat ayat allah mereka itu sebagai binatang ternak bahkan mereka lebih sesat lagi mereka itulah orang orang yang lalai
5802675 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu mengikuti sebahagian dari orang orang yang al kitab nescaya mereka akan mengembalikan kamu menjadi orang kafir sesudah kamu beriman
5802676 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu taati orang orang itu nescaya mereka mengembalikan kamu ke belakang kepada kekafiran lalu kamu menjadi orang yang rugi
5802677 dan kami hendak memberi kurnia kepada orang orang yang tertindas di bumi mesir itu dan hendak menjadikan mereka pemimpin dan menjadikan mereka orang orang yang mewarisi bumi al qasas 5

5802683 allah tidak menghendaki melainkan menyempurnakan cahayanya sekalipun orang orang kafir tidak menyukainya

5802685 sesungguhnya allah pasti menolong orang menolong agamanya sesungguhnya allah benar benar maha kuat lagi maha perkasa
5802686 sesungguhnya bumi ini kepunyaan allah dipesakakannya kepada siapa yang dikehendakinya dari hamba hambanya al araf 128
5802687 negeri akhirat itu kami jadikan untuk orang orang yang tidak ingin menyombongkan diri dan berbuat kerosakan di muka bumi dan kesudahan yang baik itu adalah bagi orang orang yang bertakwa
5802688 mereka itu mahu memadamkan agama allah dengan mulut mereka dan allah penyempurna agamanya sekalipun di benci oleh orang orang kafir
5802689 apakah manusia itu mengira mereka akan ditinggalkan begitu saja untuk berkata kami telah beriman sedangkan mereka tidak diuji
5802690 hai orang orang yang beriman sukakah kamu ditunjukkan satu perniagaan yang dapat menyelamatkan kamu dari azab yang pedih
5802691 celupan allah dan siapakah yang lebih baik celupannya daripada allah
5802692 yang demikian itu kerana sesungguhnya allah adalah pelindung orang orang beriman dan kerana sesungguhnya orang orang kafir itu tiada mempunyai pelindung

5802731 we need to hear from the ethics commission on this matter and since no binding opinion can be offered after the fact i am filing a formal complaint today and i believe the commission will agree that governor carcieri violated the spirit if not the letter of the ethics law when he hired his niece to join the executive staff
5802732 the ethics laws are in place to prevent elected officials from doing exactly what the governor has done handing out taxpayer funded positions as a reward for campaign work and thats why im asking to have this issue properly investigated and adjudicated
5802733 i find the governors timing suspicious he was in no great rush to remove the former chairman for nearly two years and now as more questions are raised about the governors ethical judgment he conveniently finds mr magro who just happens to be another failed gop candidate
5802734 if the governor was really serious about getting an honest and complete opinion from the ethics commission shouldnt he have waited until the nepotism issue was settled before making a new appointment
5802735 parents grandparents adult children siblings grandchildren uncles aunts nieces nephews and first cousins
5802736 no person subject to the code of ethics shall participate in any matter as part of his or her public duties if he or she has reason to believe or expect that any person within his or her family or any household member will derive a direct monetary gain or suffer a direct monetary loss or obtain an employment advantage
5802737 they checked all that shes been with me she was in the campaign shes my wifes niece by marriage its a distant relation
5802738 a person has an interest which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of duties if any person within his or her family will derive a direct monetary gain
5802739 any lay person can pick up the law and within two minutes see that its a clear violation of the ethics rules and regulations and against the law in rhode island
5802740 there seems to be in the governors mind one set of rules and laws for everyone in the state and a separate set for him
5802741 the governor lacks the strength of character to defend what clearly is a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the rhode island code of ethics rather then admitting to another lapse in ethical judgment he has sent his party cronies out to attack my family and me how heroic
5802742 the code of ethics section pertaining to nepotism was amended for clarity purposes last year but the prohibition on a governor or any general officer hiring their own niece to work under them in state government was in place prior to the language change
5802743 i believe the governor has an obligation to justify why he felt it appropriate to aggressively target state employees and promise sweeping job cuts while simultaneously giving his niece a taxpayer funded pay raise that averages to slightly under 3 000 a year it is the ultimate hypocrisy and a glaring example of this governors growing arrogance
5802744 its the same thing week after week with this governor he pontificates from the bully pulpit about the need to reign in state spending and reduce services and then rewards a family member with a hefty pay increase were all the employees in the governors office treated with such generosity

5802756 obama has frequently voted to finance the war but was one of 14 senate democrats to oppose a war funding bill last year after republicans removed troop withdrawal deadlines saying he did not want to be validating the same failed policy in iraq
5802757 voted against legislation to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq and to direct more than 1 billion to the department of veteran affairs as well as other legislation funding care for veterans
5802758 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5802759 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5802760 doesnt like to talk about when he was a pow
5802761 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5802762 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5802763 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5802764 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5802765 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5802766 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5802767 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5802768 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5802769 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5802770 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5802771 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5802772 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5802773 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5802774 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5802775 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5802776 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5802777 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5802778 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5802779 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5802780 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5802781 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5802782 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5802783 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5802784 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5802785 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5802786 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5802787 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5802788 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5802789 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5802790 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5802791 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5802792 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5802793 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5802794 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5802795 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5802796 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5802797 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5802798 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5802799 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5802800 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5802801 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5802802 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5802803 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5802804 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5802805 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5802806 this will allow us to put all our finished goods under one roof and consolidate all of our distribution operations in that facility
5802807 this is an exciting time in my life because i not only get to enjoy retirement with my husband of 41 years and spend time with our children and grandchildren but also remain in banking on a part time basis under a phased retirement plan
5802808 mary ann is certainly qualified to carry on the leadership role at our bank and we are proud that we were able to promote within our ranks continuing to serve the banking needs of north sedgwick county

5802816 i think having someone neutral in our racial dialogue may be very helpful a leader that can bridge the social divide between blacks and whites would be an asset in the repertoire of a president facing these legacy issues of our american heritage it is time for the race card to be replaced in the deck there are fifty one other cards that are more relevant
5802817 they didnt allow us to play our game they crushed us
5802818 i think in this team no one is looking back at the past mentally were very strong and were well prepared
5802819 whatever other people are thinking about us weve just got to concentrate on playing our volleyball its been good to win every match 3 0
5802820 the other teams have more respect for us because of this although for us psychologically it doesnt change anything
5802821 we were very nervous so we didnt play as well as we can and it was a really tough match

5802825 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime

5802839 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5802840 ok taxes define rich i mean give me a number is it 50 000 100 000 200 000 everybody keeps talking about who were going to tax how can you define that
5802841 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5802842 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5802843 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5802844 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5802845 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5802851 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5802852 the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

5802861 the pullback of russian forces will depend on how fast georgian troops return to their barracks as per the peace plan and on progress in setting up new security zones for russian peacekeepers
5802862 nato has sought to make the aggressor look like a victim
5802863 instead of trying to restrain mr saakashvili nato lets him dictate to the alliance what it should do to meet his ambitions
5802864 i fully agree with mr scheffer that business as usual between russia and nato is no longer possible
5802865 everyday we detain groups of armed georgian soldiers roaming about on georgian territory without orders
5802866 yesterday we disarmed 20 georgian troops including three ethnic arabs who were driving in five hummers armed with automatic rifles and grenade launchers
5802867 there is a review to be made wholesome review to be made
5802868 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5802869 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5802870 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5802871 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

5802884 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5803212 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
5803213 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
5803214 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5803215 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5803216 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
5803217 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation

5803240 for the past several months we have communicated our legal concerns with muxtape and repeatedly tried to work with them to have illegal content taken down
5803241 muxtape has not obtained authorization from our member companies to host or stream copies of their sound recordings
5803242 this is the latest in a long line of companies that the recording industry has threatened
5803243 they want to shut down any distribution that they didnt sanction
5803244 lo importante no es qui n marque los goles sino que gane el equipo
5803245 que sa l vea puerta es bueno a m no me preocupa llevar pocos goles ahora eso no me sirve como test porque a lo mejor meto muchos ahora y pocos en liga cuando cuentan es cuando juguemos por puntos y ah dar todo por marcar no es buen asunto presionar con eso desde ya
5803246 si yo no puedo marcar que los goles los meta otro compa ero lo que cuenta es que el equipo vaya ganando y sumando puntos en la delantera hemos fichado bien nadie se pueda relajar
5803247 este jueves ante el m laga intentaremos dar una buena imagen ante nuestra gente y demostrar un poco lo que haremos durante todo el a o la actitud y ganas que tenemos estamos muy ilusionados
5803248 es importante seguir con una base ya nos conocemos y la mayor a llevamos varios a os juntos y no s lo en el campo sino tambi n fuera nos respetamos y llegado el momento te sientes como en una segunda casa
5803249 we held out a lot of our starters today so we some inconsistency
5803250 but that was no excuse for some of the mistakes that were made we had some bad snaps some offsides penalties some of our upperclassmen werent there today mentally and we will have to correct that
5803251 we will meet as a staff and gameplan all day on wednesday over the next day we will go over the depth chart and make some personnel decisions
5803252 whats interesting is the wealth of jobs in this city and the diversity of positions
5803253 if you were to look at new york versus san francisco or versus chicago or versus boston the difference wouldnt be as large
5803254 new york companies would not be able to survive paying that wage differential unless there was an offsetting production advantage to being in new york
5803255 people arent shopping theyre not staying in hotels theyre not eating out as much
5803256 not only that but everyone is feeling the pinch from the increase in utility costs and the increase in fuel costs
5803257 were taking action less than two months into the fiscal year
5803258 while the economic outlook right now is a challenge we shouldnt look at it as doom and gloom but as an opportunity to make some improvements
5803259 i dont think theres a whole lot of fat and waste in our city budget but there certainly are ways we can be more efficient
5803260 we talked in the last two budget years that a storm is coming
5803261 well its come the shift has occurred i wont be surprised in the next two or three weeks to hear about even more cuts at the local level
5803262 we have abundant evidence in this community that reducing fares substantially increases ridership
5803263 what we expected to find is that the migration to ipv6 is slow
5803264 i dont think youd find anyone that expected there to be a significant ramp up in ipv6 usage what was surprising in what we found is that there is no migration
5803265 we saw a flat proportion of ipv4 to ipv6 over the course of the year
5803266 so although in aggregate ipv6 did grow its growing at about the same level that general internet traffic is growing
5803267 we have some monitoring in asia but we would like to see more there obviously iekel johnson admitted
5803268 its not quite as comprehensive as the european and north american measurements
5803269 in general we agree with the findings of the report issued today
5803270 it seems comprehensive and we appreciate the value of these types of studies as they help raise awareness and understanding of critical industry issues
5803271 we see press releases from lots of providers across the world talking about ipv6 readiness or infrastructure deployed and im sure its all true it just doesnt seem like anyone is using it
5803272 its a slow moving train and there is no perception that there is an immediate problem so there is nothing motivating the switch

5803287 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me and without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas ill never forget that no matter where you are no matter how difficult the circumstances there will always be someone who will pick you up
5803288 it just sounded so fake and so contrived so i did a little research about it
5803289 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope
5803290 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5803291 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5803292 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5803293 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5803294 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5803295 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5803296 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5803297 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5803298 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5803299 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5803300 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5803301 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work

5803595 pictured here is the west end of the veil nebula known technically as ngc 6960 but less formally as the witchs broom nebula the expanding debris cloud gains its colors by sweeping up and exciting existing nearby gas the supernova remnant lies about 1400 light years away towards the constellation of cygnus this witchs broom actually spans over three times the angular size of the full moon the bright star cygnus is visible with the unaided eye from a dark location but is unrelated to the ancient supernova

5803597 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5803598 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5803599 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5803600 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
5803601 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
5803602 everywhere i go people have told me oh im getting nervous
5803603 they did it to john kerry they did it to gore they tried to do it to clinton they did it to dukakis thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign
5803604 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5803605 if post election the us joins the kyoto system its involvement would take away the excuses for inaction from developing countries like china and india
5803606 sovereign actions that in itself would be an incredibly good thing
5803607 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers towards linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5803608 if we do switch to a different chemical has that chemical been thoroughly vetted and are there side affects that impact people and children
5803609 in the end this bill is about a synthetic hormone that is in our childrens food
5803610 im not in a position to be able to evaluate the science and its frustrating
5803611 my colleagues say better be safe than sorry i cant make that decision
5803612 i think were very excited about the idea of having a science based approach to looking at these chemicals rather than a political fight over each and every one
5803613 ideally soon we will be out of the business for handling measures like this
5803614 but for today our kids rely on us to do the right thing
5803615 i dont believe there will be a crash because interest rates are still low the economy is strong and employment is high and the market will remain robust in areas where people are moving for work such as london
5803616 we will see rises of 1 2 next year manchester and birmingham will do well

5803619 with the first online olympics in progress the internet has removed barriers related to international time zones as fans have 24 7 access to updated olympics content and video

5803622 given the movement of the dollar the renminbi hasnt appreciated as dramatically as significantly as against some other currencies like the euro and the yen
5803623 and so i think one of the things weve tried to do and weve done with some success is encourage other countries to speak about this topic and to engage with the chinese very directly on it
5803624 theres a lot of us investment in china and to get the protections that our investors need is something thats important and difficult to do on the other hand theres very little investment that the chinese have in the us and we think it would be a positive for both of our countries to have them have more investment in the us
5803625 the chinese sometimes question whether their investment is welcome here
5803626 the rising hispanic population on the east end great new latin american restaurants

5803636 youre not in charge sorry someone had to say it
5803637 dat zou pijnlijk geweest zijn ik wilde ze de mogelijkheid geven erover na te denken
5803638 als men ze hier niet tegen kan houden is het vrij spel
5803639 we moeten bidden dat ze aan de andere kant tot hun positieven komen

5803646 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of

5803658 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
5803659 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
5803660 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

5803769 as well as being useful domestic science can help to save money but now we have two generations of children who have not been taught even the basics we are losing vital life skills
5803770 we learned how to bake french bread pizza and use a sewing machine i had the boxers i made they were a frog print fabric for years afterwards
5803771 the idea was that we would learn to use a sewing machine but all the machines were broken and they couldnt afford to fix them so i hand sewed a stuffed bunny and learned the invaluable skill of pulling stuffed animal fur out of a seam shop class was way more awesome i learned to use a jigsaw
5803772 i sewed an ugly sweatshirt that i wore to gym class for years but i also learned how to sew buttons and stuff like that
5803773 enhanced the status of the game in the eyes of many sports fans who ordinarily dont follow tennis
5803774 i can imagine that tennis would even have a more enhanced status in 2012 when it is played at the all england club
5803775 so just look at the nations who did not earn a single medal in tennis in beijing they include powerhouses like serbia
5803776 narrowly missed adding one in singles as well when na li fell to dinara safina in a tight third place match
5803777 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
5803778 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
5803779 they knew things about my prescribing habits that i didnt know myself
5803780 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
5803781 by selling data that allows pharmaceutical sales representatives to see which doctors are prescribing which drugs the ama is giving drugmakers what they need to exert more influence
5803782 the processes of thinking are intertwined with the content of thought that is domain knowledge
5803783 thus if you remind a student to look at an issue from multiple perspectives often enough he will learn that he ought to do so but if he doesnt know much about an issue he cant think about it from multiple perspectives
5803784 why dont students like school a cognitive scientist answers questions about how your mind works and what it means for the classroom
5803785 most states had initiatives designed to encourage educators to teach critical thinking and one of the most widely used programs tactics for thinking sold 70 000 teacher guides
5803786 the evidence shows that such programs primarily improve students thinking with the sort of problems they practiced in the program not with other types of problems
5803787 more generally its doubtful that a program that effectively teaches students to think critically in a variety of situations will ever be developed
5803788 the barns burnt down now i can see the moon
5803789 we did have a poisonous plant but we removed it yesterday
5803790 it was brought to our attention by a resident peter smith principal went out and walked the grounds to make sure there were no others we acted quickly and removed it from the roots
5803791 its highly toxic and may be fatal if eaten when we had more livestock around the farmers got rid of it because it can poison all classes of livestock basically its a weed pull it out
5803792 it was not overrun at the school as it is in my yard but there was a humongous one taking over the side where the little kids play
5803793 i notified the school they just stood there with their mouths open they removed it immediately right next to the bush is a kitchenette set kids can play with there was a pile of the green berries inside
5803794 these are the kids who would put things in their mouths
5803795 i can see out my bedroom window and it has overcome my bushes
5803796 i dont think people realize how dangerous it is when we pull it up theres a very putrid smell very pungent
5803797 i described it and no one had a clue what it was
5803798 they are coming up from the marsh and taking over our yard
5803799 they have damaged our neighbors septic system and are moving in on us now theyre horrible

5803815 let me start by saying that ive not got it in for my firm merrill lynch despite the terrible securities losses that have engulfed our firm these last 12 months and the resulting job cuts and pressures which have come with this period of turmoil i still believe in this firm i believe that despite a couple of missteps ceo john thain is the right man to lead us and i remain confident that we will emerge from our troubles a better more focused business i have to say however that the fact that merrill imposed an almost across the board hiring freeze last week has got me worried whilst most of my colleagues are taking this initiative at face value i wonder what the implications really are and am concerned that the freeze itself is just a marker which firm executives are putting down to signal that there are much tougher times ahead by its own admission our firm probably wont save much money by the imposition of a hiring freeze for the next 20 weeks in a memo to staff last week merrill acknowledged that the majority of the firms hiring occurs during the first and second quarters of the year with the third and fourth quarters progressively tapering off so why given that the cost savings will be relatively insignificant has merrill come out and imposed an official freeze now especially when rivals like morgan stanley are signalling a very different message and why given that thain has said that he wishes to attract the very best to come to our firm at all levels so that we can be well positioned for the upturn have we made it clear that we are closed for business on the hiring front and how will this move affect our existing staffs morale

5803825 de momento no hay se ales de pasos rusos en el sentido de retirarse
5803826 todav a esperamos la retirada de sus tropas estamos muy decepcionados porque pese a las promesas que nos hicieron no ha habido retirada
5803827 los rusos deben respetar la firma y deben retirar sus tropas
5803828 its great news for the free speech rights for these students
5803829 although its extremely unfortunate that the students were not allowed to give their talk at defcon
5803830 it was definitely unfair to use that statute to silence the students
5803831 we certainly hope the next time that people are allowed to present their important research instead of being silenced by bogus lawsuits
5803832 were glad the court actually saw things as they should be

5803844 marian has been here a few days now and as soon as possible i would like to see this player on the field
5803845 he is a good goalkeeper and he has a chance to play against st mirren
5803846 mike can train with the team again from tomorrow but i dont think he is ready to play 90 minutes he is ready for full training and david obua is also here
5803847 he needs to acclimatise to the football and the weather in scotland because in africa it is 27 or 28 degrees just now he is a little colder here but he is okay he is ready to be a hearts player
5803848 i am very happy with the decision of the national coach
5803849 michael is back in the squad after many years absence and i am so happy for his development
5803850 if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother

5803860 by integrating the two solutions social amp media applications and an enterprise scale video management and distribution solution web publishers have the means to handle even the most advanced media requirements with on demand deployment we are enabling web publishers to dramatically reduce costs and time to market
5803861 when there is a gap between ones real and ones declared aims one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms like a cuttlefish squirting out ink
5803862 in our age there is no such thing as keeping out of politics all issues are political issues and politics itself is a mass of lies evasions folly hatred and schizophrenia
5803863 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible

5803890 we are concerned with equality in all domains we want parliament to discuss this
5803891 we are calling for the abolition of the obligation to serve in the army so men and women can have equality in this
5803892 to require compulsory service could be contrary to the european convention of human rights on forced labour you cannot force people to work for free for the state
5803893 the mass armies which dated back to the 19th century and were actually created for inter state war are not necessary any more in western europe
5803894 most european countries have large troops in areas of conflict mainly for peace support operations no european state is sending compulsory personnel into such missions that is why most europeans have abandoned conscription
5803895 switzerland is going to slowly be surrounded by those who have given up conscription i think when germany or austria do the same we will have this spill over effect
5803896 i think switzerland has had a national identity crisis since the end of the cold war almost overnight the classical cornerstone of swiss security policies such as neutrality concordance militia conscription and federalism have lost importance
5803897 uma das coisas que precisamos mudar nesse pa s a id ia que as pessoas n o podem discordar sem desafiar o car ter e patriotismo uma da outra
5803898 you should send peter to public school then he would get to play with me at recess

5803905 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing
5803906 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet
5803907 hes so big and so global now im sure well try to top it
5803908 we had hoped to have it end at johnny unitas stadium but that may not cut it
5803909 with the pride and anticipation that comes with the spirit of the olympic games
5803910 michael brought that spirit back to life and has made this years games an unforgettable experience for all marylanders
5803911 we all look forward to welcoming michael home in the coming weeks
5803912 the lack of any consistent lines of attack against mccain is becoming palpable
5803913 a selec o n o uma casa com lugares marcados

5803921 todas esas formas que nacen del poder popular como son las empresas familiares emprendedores las microempresas las empresas de propiedad social directas e indirectas la de distribuci n las de producci n est n plasmadas en la ley y han querido decir que nosotros estamos en contra de constituci n
5803922 antes estad sticamente no se contaban esas cifras porque el gobierno no financiaba las iniciativas del poder popular el gobierno no apoyaba a la peque a y mediana industria y gracias a la revoluci n se cre un instituto para la peque a y mediana industria hemos querido reformular la ley existente que se hab a hecho en base a la ley habilitante del 2002 para actualizarla y poder definir campos precisos y poder impulsar esta econom a

5803924 he may be at 30 40 50 million a year in endorsements after all this is said and done
5803925 14 000 kilometer per jaar als totale afstand voor een gezin van vier lijkt aan de lage kant bovendien wordt vergeleken met het duurste en door treinreizigers minst gebruikte product de nettreinkaart
5803926 voor een heen en terugrit tussen antwerpen en brussel bijvoorbeeld betaalt een treinkaarthouder per dag nauwelijks 8 procent van de kost van een automobilist
5803927 ik hoop dat die docent geen wiskunde geeft want zijn cijfertjes zijn niet te volgen
5803928 de vlaamse minister van mobiliteit kent de nmbs tarieven blijkbaar niet ik ga haar een brochure met een overzicht van al onze tarieven opsturen indien ze een treinkaart antwerpen brussel zou kopen kost haar dat 2 euro per dag of 2 eurocent per kilometer
5803929 een abonnement bij de lijn is uiteraard goedkoper omdat hun klanten ook veel kortere afstanden afleggen dan de nmbs reizigers
5803930 de obligaties waarin we investeerden hebben niet voor verlies gezorgd maar meer dan een miljard dollar opgebracht
5803931 zeer moeilijk is om nu te voorspellen wanneer en of we meer kapitaal zullen nodig hebben
5803932 het is een oorlogsverklaring aan de islam en bovendien heeft de auteur slecht opzoekingswerk verricht
5803933 we are at the dawn of a new era in mobile communications driven by the rapid convergence of the internet and mobility and nokia is setting the pace of change but with market leadership in an industry of this scale also comes responsibility
5803934 we are committed to taking a leading role in increasing environmental awareness and performance right across the industry creating further products and services that help people make more sustainable choices it is both the responsible thing to do and it makes good business sense
5803935 we set out to create the music experience that people are telling us they are looking for all the music they want in the form of unlimited downloads to their mobile device and pc
5803936 even if you listened to music 24 hours a day seven days a week you would still only scratch the surface of the music that were making available comes with music fulfils our dream to give consumers all the music they want wherever they want it while rewarding the artists who create it
5803937 its fantastic to work with nokia on comes with music
5803938 we feel its an innovative way for people to discover and enjoy new artists while at the same time having access to the amazing depth of the universal catalog comes with music allows our artists to reach new audiences in a very easy and affordable way
5803939 ovi combines the mobile pc and web environments into an easy to use experience with common user interface elements that provide consistency and simplicity
5803940 we started the ovi services rollout with the individual services in navigation music and games and the next step is to provide an integrated experience the complete ovi environment and new services will be rolled out continuously throughout 2008
5803941 you know we had drivers we had hired that we didnt have work for them to do
5803942 we had trained people and so we were driving people sending people to places to keep them earning a living and that was the other part of the problem
5803943 this is a tremendous loss for our community because working with these types of persons who maybe have been disenfranchised or giving people a second chance is a crucial part of what community is supposed to be about
5803944 je kan nooit weten wat er op je weg komt
5803945 you dont think hell take the car and drive off somewhere do you
5803946 man there was a lot of tundra at that party but it was a bit too frosty to close the deal
5803947 you think im gonna use this but really im just going to open it up and throw it on the floor when youre not looking
5803948 greetings from a tiny island at the southern tip of malay peninsula
5803949 it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
5803950 this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus
5803951 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus because through christ jesus the law of the spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death
5803952 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
5803953 they handed those bronze star medals out like candy i dont care beans about it
5803954 its like when a barber hands a lollipop to a kid to keep him from squalling its a bunch of bull
5803955 patton looked past my nose and bradleys and spotted all those jeeps lined up
5803956 george there is no sense moving the jeeps now were leaving
5803957 what are you moving those jeeps now for were leaving
5803958 it was a maniacs plan and adolf hitler was a very rattled maniac by then a few months before he had almost been blown up in his wolfs lair
5803959 when i heard it was brazil i was cheering in doping control
5803960 this team wants to reclaim what we could have gotten
5803961 one of the most amazing things with our team is we dont have that big name player
5803962 that abby wambach that mia hamm that julie foudy people dont really know us
5803963 i think the one thing that we took from that is that its impossible to win a championship if were not on the same page
5803964 it would be arrogant for me to ignore it and say lets move on
5803965 i got five different stories about what happened and i had two questions do you want to win do we need a goalkeeper
5803966 what patches do i need in order to be up to date with moss wss
5803967 our strong economics department including brian fikkert and lance weschers academic expertise from graduate studies in economics at yale and notre dame is complemented by work in our community development major
5803968 the college is in the process of building a minor in islamic studies and the arabic language sequence is foundational to that effort
5803969 han sido dos d as positivos porque comparado con la carrera del domingo hemos avanzado pero no podemos olvidar que a n estamos lejos del punto que queremos alcanzar
5803970 and if were going to surge anywhere mr ambassador you will probably hear from some on the committee beyond me but youll clearly hear on the senate floor we think that surge should be afghanistan not iraq where the taliban appears to be making a serious comeback so there may be some questions about afghanistan as well
5803971 seems somewhat parochial but i think as youll see is of concern across the world
5803972 success in afghanistan is still possible if we surge forces anywhere it should be in afghanistan not iraq
5803973 general thanks for the very useful testimony i want to focus on where both of you ended up and ambassador dobbins as well and thats on the issue of pakistan given your history there your relationship with both the pakistani military on the ground as well as their government can you give me a sense of what their strategic objectives are and what we can do to encourage them to be more aggressive or more cooperative in the efforts i tend to agree with the ambassadors point that if we pretend that were going to do things here that were not going to do thats not particularly effective and that sanctions may not be particularly effective on the other hand we need to encourage a different approach on their part any thoughts on that
5803974 if were surging troops anywhere it should be in afghanistan
5803975 the united states will have to depend on foreign rockets and spacecraft to send americans to orbit
5803976 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5803977 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5803978 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5803979 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5803980 its very interesting to see mccain now paint himself as a strong supporter of nasa
5803981 when he could have stepped up to support the program he has not done that he has no general respect forour community
5803982 an overall review early in the administration of where nasas money is spent to determine an appropriate plan of action
5803983 it could introduce a big unknown and make this race a lot more complicated but i certainly dont hold it against her
5803984 im one of those who think that democracy works in strange ways
5803985 the land where negros who are mentally depressed amp crazed from centuries of colonialism servitude amp oppression still cant shake off habits they learned from the colonialists
5803986 im just proud to death of them to see them keep plugging away in tough situations
5803987 she would be asked to take a big box of colored pencils dump them the ground sort them then put them back in the box and start the process all over again she was to the point of so much more capable than that
5803988 we explored what is the point of a work ethic
5803989 we talked about the fact that god is a worker he worked six days and then rested so just as were created in his image its our jobs as christians to be a good employee
5803990 within the last few hours ive spoken with two of the finalists for the role of barack obamas running mate and to two other sources who are close to the process my bottom line is this barring a big surprise or last minute change of heart the choice is likely to be sen joe biden of deleware chairman of the foreign relations committee
5803991 we went out with the messenger of allah may allah bless him and grant him peace in the yearof khaybar
5803992 tell the prophet that here is umar bin al khattab asking for permission to enter
5803993 leave them for these days are the days of id and the days of mina
5803994 once the prophet was screening me and i was watching the display of black slaves in the mosque and umar scolded them the prophet said leave them o bani arfida carry on you are safe protected
5803995 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5803996 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5803997 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5803998 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5803999 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5804000 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5804001 why would god punish pharoah for not letting the hebrews go when moses asked if god had already hardened his heart to say no
5804002 i need female voices can you come to a reading next week
5804003 it is a comprehensive security program to protect the lower manhattan area indeed all of manhattan from vehicle born explosive devices
5804004 this is more like being under communist reign instead of being in a free country and being able to choose where you want to go when you want to go and not be monitored at all times
5804005 i mean if you dont have anything to worry about you wont worry
5804006 now if youre trying to hide something and they scan your license plate you have a problem then theres good reason
5804007 as hip teses de roubo contra turista e seq estro est o descartadas
5804008 i remember that match i played well and the atmosphere was fantastic now i cant wait to play here again im fit and im optimistic
5804009 they saw i was disgruntled they saw that me sitting to the side and watching and we know it wasnt going to work out well for either of us
5804010 we made the right decision they allowed me to go and im just happy to know that im leaving with good character
5804011 i talked to smitty coach mike smith and i talked to general manager thomas dimitroff we shook hands and we wished each other the best
5804012 the idea that the universe is worth studying just because its worth studying is a religious idea
5804013 if you think the universe is fundamentally good and that its an expression of a good god then studying how the universe works is a way of becoming intimate with the creator its a kind of worship and thats been a big motivation for doing any kind of science
5804014 a hundred years ago we didnt understand the big bang
5804015 now that we have the understanding of a universe that is big and expanding and changing we can ask philosophical questions we would not have known to ask like what does it mean to have multiverses these are wonderful questions science isnt going to answer them but science by telling us what is there causes us to ask these questions it makes us go back to the seven days of creation which is poetry beautiful poetry with a lesson underneath it and say oh the seventh day is god resting as a way of reminding us that god doesnt do everything god built this universe but gave you and me the freedom to make choices within the universe
5804016 we call dawkinss stance sci entism and there is reference to it in the encyclical
5804017 is the pejorative word sometimes used for the view that science can explain everything and kind of arrogates to itself the privilege of explaining everything science cannot tell you what is right and wrong when it comes to really interesting questions like where did the laws of physics come from or how did the universe arrive in the first place i genuinely dont know whether science will answer those deep and at present mysterious questions i am confident that if science cant answer them nothing else can but it may be that nothing will ever answer them
5804018 i met him a few weeks ago and liked him very much
5804019 and he said to me that there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to believe in god and so i said why do you believe in god and he said its quite simple i was brought up catholic when i think about good scientists and some are devoutly religious and many of them are catholic jesuit brothers and priests for instance i can never make out whether they are compartmentalizing their minds sometimes if you press them it turns out that what they believe is something very different from what it says in the creed it turns out that all they really believe is that there is some deeply mysterious unknown at the root of the universe
5804020 i did not tell richard dawkins that there was no reason to believe in god
5804021 i said reasons are not adequate faith is not irrational it is arational it goes beyond reason it doesnt contradict reason so my take is precisely that faith to me is a gift from god i didnt reason to it i didnt merit it it was given to me as a gift through my family and my teachers my science helps to enrich that gift from god because i see in his creation what a marvelous and loving god he is for instance by making the universe an evolutionary universe he didnt make it a ready made like a washing machine or a car he made it a universe that has in it a participation of creativity dawkinss real question to me should be how come you have the gift of faith and i dont and thats an embarrassment for me the only thing i can say is that either you have it and dont know it or god works with each of us differently and god does not deny that gift to anybody i firmly believe that
5804022 cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved

5804044 wellllll we think it might be best if we just started over from scratch yeeeaaaaaah
5804045 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5804046 my home was burned my possessions looted i arrived here with only the clothes on my back
5804047 many people have nowhere to go the government just wants us gone from the camps but its avoiding the facts its only doing this for publicity
5804048 in kalenjin towns like eldoret when people realize you are kikuyu theyll never hire you at least for now there is peace but if the politicians differ again we will have war the politicians are the ones who can end or worsen tribalism the problem is not the common people
5804049 i have no job no possessions nothing to start my life
5804050 i still have hope that the government will come to our assistance the tenants the youth the people who were not landowners but if they dont we are going to suffer if im forced to leave im not sure what i will do i may become a criminal

5804054 this year beautiful ancient asian forms will commingle with cutting edge european multimedia work and the wild antics of our own resident drag queen
5804055 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5804056 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5804057 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5804058 as we look forward into the second half of the year we see continued pressure on our markets
5804059 brothers let us drink from the haloed cup of innebriation
5804060 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
5804061 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5804062 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5804063 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5804064 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5804065 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5804066 no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run i will honor senator mccains service just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states of america
5804067 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5804068 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer because there will be that one day in your twenties when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
5804069 jass extensive executive experience provides taser international a critical addition to our management team enhancing strategic oversight of our significantly expanded research and business development programs
5804070 vendors have been working on this for a long time
5804071 its not like they just said were going to do this to be green because its partly about business considerations its coming along quickly because its what operators want and its what vendors have been looking to do anyway
5804072 not only do i think that going green is a good idea from a social responsibility perspective in many cases there are also financial incentives to do so in that every dollar i can save on energy costs i can spend improving the customer experience in some meaningful way
5804073 what weve always seen is that it usually takes a crisis or a really strong driver to look at new ways of innovating
5804074 when you approach the market before its ready or before theres a driver you dont see a lot of demand i think the market is starting to get there i think that people are starting to get to the reality that fuel costs and electricity costs are going to go up and its going to stay that way
5804075 the adoption curve is i believe clearly slower than anyone had hoped for in the back up area with hydrogen fuel cells but it is steadily moving forward
5804076 in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week in fact it is hard to imagine that the zi boards unwillingness to negotiate with nuance and to provide information that would support a basis for a higher offer is consistent with the zi boards fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of zi and its shareholders
5804077 but in my opinion cellphones are built as a throw away product and the astronomical volumes equate to substantial energy use and disposal problems
5804078 just not a consistent standard meaning and theres a substantial push to mine that advantage
5804079 consumers who see green or enviro friendly must be alert to details
5804080 without clear standards companies are using these terms for marketing advantage its difficult to make intelligent choices
5804081 and a big part of our thrust is consumer awareness a drawerful of handsets is not the consumers top of mind issue so were looking at when and where is the best place to intervene we want the consumers attention
5804082 but there are common denominators being eco friendly is now a differentiator for certain consumer segments and carriers are asking for it
5804083 everyone wants to reduce the use of toxic materials and energy it starts in the sand
5804084 its a combination of factors you have to look at all the pieces and impact them all and you have to be a good fortune teller to predict the next problem area
5804085 our two demands are that companies should 1 clean up their products by eliminating hazardous substances and 2 take back and recycle their products responsibly once they become obsolete
5804086 the two issues are connected the use of harmful chemicals in electronic products prevents their safe recycling once the products are discarded
5804087 the time resources and costs saved will be of tremendous benefit particularly in todays energy strapped economy
5804088 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
5804089 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad networks cpms cost per thousand impressions
5804090 i think the problem is that theyre employing online methodologies in the mobile environment and it just doesnt work one to one there are no browser standards on the traditional internet you have to deal with device libraries screen sizes you need to be able to target by carrier weve worked with several different networks online and they come back and say mobile is too much of a pain in the ass
5804091 the current legislation in the united states is positive because it is raising awareness about cellphone recycling the wireless alliance hopes that the states will remain proactive in their efforts
5804092 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
5804093 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
5804094 the information and communication technology sector has much to offer in creating a cleaner greener world but it must also apply international standards in reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions
5804095 it is crucial that the ict industry both acknowledges and seeks to reduce its role in climate change
5804096 communications technologies can play a vital role in reducing carbon emissions worldwide developing global standards for reducing the energy requirements of networks and equipment will help make ict an even more powerful tool for businesses to use in managing their greenhouse gas emissions and meeting their climate change targets
5804097 the epa is calling on americans to reuse and recycle old electronics
5804098 recycling cellphones helps the environment by saving energy and keeping useable and valuable materials out of landfills
5804099 maintaining a successful national consumer friendly wireless recycling program has been a longstanding priority for the wireless industry
5804100 any additional effort to raise public awareness and spotlight the important issue of wireless recycling is a good thing in my book we welcome the new campaign and look forward to working with the epa and partnering companies as we continue to spread the message about how easy it is to recycle cellphones
5804101 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
5804102 i think a lot of service providers are still operating on legacy systems
5804103 the ngn transformations are expected to be complete in europe at least by the end of 2010 2011 so in that interim and during that migration if there are solutions that will be able to improve the efficiency of existing solutions well see a demand for that
5804104 interestingly enough theres a split in the industry where companies will see a market advantage because theyve phased out toxic chemicals faster than their competitors then they support stronger guidelines
5804105 i think terms of what progress to expect in five years on the chemical side there will be no player in the global market with products that have pvc or brominated flame retardants mobile phone companies have some of the best corporate policies across the board on a lot of issues especially in terms of take back because they can afford to its not as expensive to recycle and its a benefit to them because they can recycle a lot of the materials in their phones
5804106 were probably looking at doing a little more marketing but just making the program available for people has been the biggest part
5804107 were just looking for ways to bring the total amount of product we can bring back in
5804108 we havent yet seen a deceleration of the amount of e waste going into those hidden flows
5804109 oftentimes theres open burning to get scrap metal its crazy because this stuff is filled with toxic chemicals
5804110 data cards arent just for road warriors but also for couch and kitchen warriors
5804111 consumers dont like to pay for the same thing twice
5804112 paid time off banks can they save you time money and headaches
5804113 a really significant revenue opportunity for carriers infrastructure would be required to drive the first dollar of revenue through the door
5804114 this is using existing capital so the money ka chings right down to the bottom line
5804115 youve got to bundle it in ways that are needed to meet the requirements for helping with environmental improvements and market those effectively
5804116 in recent months the discussions of the subject have increased due to fuel costs alone not to mention the cost of goods transportation and raw materials have gone up more and more emphasis is being put on discussions and due diligence on how do we reduce costs through these type of services
5804117 hasnt had customers coming to us saying i want to save so many tons of carbon dioxide but theyve all come and said i want to save money you can save money with a conscience and thats really where green comes into play
5804118 a lot of it really is driven by conservation of cash conservation of resources and in the same token if you use less its probably going to be better for the environment
5804119 many athletes wanted to speak their mind but couldnt without considerable risk we are delighted that olympic athletes took the opportunity to contact us and downloaded the album it conveys a message of hope and solidarity with the tibetan people and a commitment to freedom of expression that cannot be suppressed
5804120 its connected with certain things that the olympic charter forbids
5804121 the downloading of the album represents an understanding that compassion and nonviolence can overcome intolerance and oppression beautiful ideals to be associated with the olympic spirit
5804122 though you can stop people from speaking out you cant stop them from listening and thinking
5804123 are rallying together to denounce internet retailers that offer songs for tibet for purchase
5804124 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
5804125 the companys goal is to even more strongly encourage customers to use this option a trial is planned for this fall utilizing an outside vendor that will be focused on increasing usage
5804126 with recycling phones people thrown them in bins and they get sifted through and thrown away
5804127 these are recycled back into the marketplace immediately theyre not going through multiple channels
5804128 it does things like put the computer on auto shut down and sleep schedules

5804131 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5804132 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5804133 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
5804134 could you tell me what kind of cost i would be expecting i cant write off a 500 check without some kind of warning

5804136 how long are you on maine i am doing a beer dinner the ebenezers pub the last week of august
5804137 we worked i would say quite quickly and hard with people to explain what is on and what is not on
5804138 and we have been able to make some headway we are working in a place where violence unfortunately is too common and where women often bear the brunt of it but it is not only women who have suffered from gender based violence it has also been young men and boys and we will continue to do what we can
5804139 we essentially started going up and down the road and talking with everybody that we could find who had a weapon who could force himself or herself onto somebody else simply by the power of the gun
5804140 and there was a lot of advocacy a lot of explaining a lot of very delicate discussions going on and the situation improved markedly over the last few months so i think that is an encouraging thing

5804143 i dont know if it makes it more difficult he said what it certainly does is it demonstrates the importance of taking on this mission i think it is a reflection of the fact that this is an enemy that needs to be taken on

5804145 the publishing divisions july results reflected continued weakness in classified advertising in most markets particularly tampa and richmond
5804146 the broadcast division generated 1 5 million in political revenues where 60 percent of the spending came from the presidential campaign partially offsetting continued softness in national time sales
5804147 higher revenues in the interactive media division were driven by a 47 percent increase in local advertising spending and another month of strong revenues from dealtaker com which is engaged in the fast growing sector of online coupons and shopping the companys web first breaking news focus and yahoo local news referrals continued to drive audience growth page views and visitor sessions were up 8 7 percent and 19 3 percent respectively local news page views were up nearly 75 percent at tbo com in tampa and 29 percent at inrich com in richmond

5804152 what the f ck are you doing having sex after an abortion abortion is not a form of birth control keep your d mn legs closed
5804153 what surrounded by the hell are you doing having sex days after an abortion you are one sick horny s lut walk back to the trailer park and super cement your coochie closed you freak
5804154 i love abortion when they are aborting babies that will become liberal otherwise it should be totally banned in any form
5804155 the way i see it abortion is wrong because it is simply a way out of a bad sitiuation which people got themselves into theres an easy way to avoid this whole situation in the first place just dont have sex its that easy or if you are a nympho and must have sex then be aware of either your or your partners menstrul cycle and avoid sex when shes ovulating it is really not that hard and as for the peoplel who get themselves pregnent they already had a choice and that choice was whether or not to have sex if i make a choice to shoot somebody in the head with a gun would i get a second choice that could allow me to just walk away from the consequences of my actions no so why should they the people made the wrong decision in having sex and they should have to deal with the consequences of their actions instead of just burying them in a dumpster like all us people who live with real responsibility live with the consequences of our actions
5804156 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics and personal ambition
5804157 i have not suggested it because i believe he genuinely wants to serve americas national interests now it is time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5804158 even in retrospect he would choose the path of failure for america over the path of success and victory
5804159 in short both candidates in this election have pledged to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5804160 the reason why conventions still matter is because millions of voters are distracted they are busy
5804161 a convention is a wonderful opportunity for both parties to tele scope into just four days their major arguments on behalf of their candidate and their party

5804186 ive suffered through reading deleting and even responding to a lot of comments that center on the idea that
5804187 it is odd that a woman would choose to work in porn would choose to use porn or would choose to defend mens and their own porn use to other women
5804188 its odd because women should instinctively sense when confronted with the vast majority of pornographic images that what they are seeing is degrading to the human spirit
5804189 boo hoo i want a cigarette so bad its soooo hard
5804190 why bother life sucks anyway i cant wait to die
5804191 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
5804192 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
5804193 they knew things about my prescribing habits that i didnt know myself
5804194 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
5804195 by selling data that allows pharmaceutical sales representatives to see which doctors are prescribing which drugs the ama is giving drugmakers what they need to exert more influence

5804203 this is stopgeorgia ru which is also utilizing stopgeorgia info as a redirect the web site itself provides ddos attack tools for download and as the screen grab shows the
5804204 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
5804205 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
5804206 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the r b n and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
5804207 said don jackson director of threat intelligence for secureworks a computer security firm based in atlanta
5804208 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
5804209 there are people who dont agree with something and they try to express themselves you have people like this in your country
5804210 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in
5804211 along with military aggression the russian federation is blocking georgian internet portals
5804212 on request of the president of georgia the president of the republic of poland has provided the web site of the president of poland for dissemination of information
5804213 over the past 48 hours russian forces have killed over 100 georgian civilians and soldiers after targeting residential complexes in georgia as well as airports bases and other vital infrastructure

5804217 it depends on what what sort of spring you get but more often than not you get a good supply of plums
5804218 it will impact the commercial farms who have acres of each variety

5804407 for most people everywhere surely food anchors holiday traditions i probably spent some years denying the good in that mostly subconsciously devoutly refusing the thanksgiving pie accepting the stigma my culture has attached to celebrating food especially for women my age because of the inscriptions written on our bodies by the children weve borne the slowing of metabolisms and inevitable shape shifting we are supposed to pretend if we are strong willed food is not all that important eat now and pay later were warned stand on the scale roll your eyes and on new years day resolve to become a moral person again but most of americas excess pounds were not gained on national holidays after a certain age we cant make a habit of pie certainly but its a soul killing dogma that says we have to snub it even on thanksgiving good people eat so do bad people skinny people fat people tall and short ones heaven help us we will never master photosynthesis planning complex beautiful meals and investing ones heart and time in their preparation is the opposite of self indulgence kitchen based family gatherings are process oriented cooperative and in the best of worlds nourishing and soulful a lot of calories get used up before anyone sits down to consume but more importantly a lot of talk happens first news exchanged secrets revealed across generations paths cleared with a touch on the arm i have given and received some of my lifes most important hugs with those big oven mitt potholders on both hands

5804416 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
5804417 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
5804418 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
5804419 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
5804420 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
5804421 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s

5804424 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country

5804522 just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies so he has also embraced his politics
5804523 the same guys who packaged george bush are packaging john mccain these people are even questioning my patriotism we shouldnt be surprised they have been doing this every election they dont know how to govern but they sure know how to run a negative campaign
5804524 this book may not be directly affiliated with the campaign
5804525 but you know suddenly magically youve got the same guy who wrote unfit for command the 2004 book about mr kerry he comes out with a book saying im a nut and you know people are questioning my patriotism john mccain himself personally said id rather lose the war so i can win an election

5804545 idea will ensure that the sec continues to stay ahead of the needs of investors
5804546 ideas launch represents a fundamental change in the way the sec collects and publishes company and fund information and in the way that investors will be able to use it
5804547 when congress created the sec and even when edgar was launched the markets worked on paper and by mail today the marketplace works online and by e mail
5804548 companies and investors alike compile analyze and produce information and reports electronically with the move to an electronic data based filing system the sec will not only keep pace with the markets but will provide investors with a dynamic useable system they can use to get the information they need
5804549 after 75 years of document based static financial reporting whether in paper documents or in electronic equivalents like pdfs it is exciting to see the sec poised to cross the data threshold and help investors receive financial information that is dynamic usable and ready to go as they make their investment decisions

5804576 there were no significant studies examining the long term health of people in communities with naturally fluoridated water however exposure via drinking water at levels not much higher than what was proposed for fluoridation had been associated in numerous published studies beginning around 1940 with serious adverse skeletal and neuromuscular effects in india and other countries opposition to fluoridation initially came from scientists concerned about the lack of good evidence on possible health risks
5804577 those who did openly oppose fluoridation were often subject of personal attack and professional reprisals for decades mainstream scientific journals would reject for publication any paper that did not articulate a strictly pro fluoridation position on risk and benefit questions
5804578 i myself had three manuscripts based on my doctoral dissertation rejected by u s public health journals in the 1970s
5804579 my reviews of the evidence on risks and benefits of fluoridation were sent to anonymous pro fluoridation referees who found them
5804580 leading phs dental researchers lobbied every leading scientific organization to gain endorsements of fluoridation they cast fluoridation as a product of scientific progress under siege from anti scientific forces and rallied the scientific community in political support of the measure they carried out a few studies looking for possible adverse effects of fluoridation the studies were poorly designed and inconclusive by todays standards but they found no convincing evidence of harm the phs declared the issues closed the debate over the studies were roundly criticized as inadequate and biased by leading opponents of the day but fluoridation advocates rapidly took the stance that there was no longer any scientific doubt that fluoridation was safe and effective their political strategy was simply to steamroll the opposition to insist that opponents had no basis for any valid objections they focused on political campaigning not on research in fact research all but halted as it was politically inexpedient for the phs to be studying questions they had already declared adequately answered
5804581 some recent studies suggest that over consumption of fluoride can raise the risks of disorders affecting teeth bones the brain and the thyroid gland
5804582 fluoridation campaigns provide a unique opportunity for dentistry to help reduce the incidence of dental disease while establishing political viability

5804590 so this season shes worked more on her short sprints her 100m and 200m and got quicker over the shorter distances

5804663 its something we have to take care not to pretend we have a monopoly on it
5804664 what do you think of this for a campaign slogan
5804665 mr harper should go to the closing ceremonies to try to repair the damage
5804666 in my opinion the governor general does what the prime minister asks her
5804667 so theres this game wow i believe its called and i believe it was incredibly popular what youve got to understand is that they changed things like when the beatles turned up in music
5804668 you cant be the beatles they sell more units they did stadiums they did everything how are you going to take them on well theres a trick if you try to be like the beatles youll end up like the monkees we dont want to be the monkees
5804669 so we decided to be the next generational band were led zeppelin the cooler heavier rocking one less members but weve got an aeroplane
5804670 no i dont think its going to rival wow but no one would ever predict that but it is a strong game that will get our returns for us were proud of it
5804671 the most varied and interesting album by cloudscape so far it contains a few really hard and raw metal songs and there will also be a few more atmospheric and dynamic songs progressively spiced
5804672 follows a full cycle of man while he makes his ascent and discoveries and is eventually brought down by his lust of conquest and greed
5804673 basically we wanted to have this album be cohesive all the way through we came up with themes for each song and then wrote the songs like we were doing a film score and try to capture the mood musically for what each theme represents
5804674 can i compete and learn in this game while controlling my emotions
5804675 its certainly a shock hed been there a long time
5804676 they ask the questions the moviegoer wants to know about they get the information the moviegoer wants to find out they give you great narrative they give you great exposition theyre the perfect movie hero and thats why i think weve had so many films featuring investigative reporters
5804677 a growing relationship or affair in the office is a mine field literally speaking
5804678 recognise that to be successful you have to know understand and use technology
5804679 our government refuses to recognise investment in the future is essential
5804680 we have never seen a gap between the leader and the rest of the pack this big
5804681 they are all windows based and we all know there were some significant problems with vista
5804682 i dont think its possible for apple to have a lead as big as this for long the other companies will retool a bit and come back
5804683 eghad how depressing you spend 30 years in a career doing your best for your employer and yourself
5804684 very excited to see if this is worth anything i think its either going to fail
5804685 if i take the weapon out of the argument i am left with the concept that some people want to be able to
5804686 before our model the company would use forecasts but the reality is that forecasts are never right by using probability theory to quantify the uncertainty of demand forecasts and projected inventory we have been able to vastly improve and speed up the decision making process
5804687 im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5804688 when their first record came out i loved them and when they put out the next record i interviewed them for much music during the warped tour i gushed about how much i loved them and i think they thought that i was really weird then they told me they were making a record with butch vig and i was like you should have me on the record ill play guitar and then a month later they called and said they had a song they wanted me to sing on its about a long distance relationship and it basically summed up everything i was trying to say on the con
5804689 well they had been in a really amazing studio and were joking they hadnt seen a girl in months so they were really nice to me im used to just being in a ghetto studio with sara going get away from me but i was at warped tour in l a yesterday and i saw the against me guys and they were all sweaty and stinky so i hope they smell better when i see them to make the video i ran into my friend hunter burgan from afi we have a side project together
5804690 we met like three years ago after he e mailed me when we were on tour with
5804691 varf r biter idrottsm n i sina medaljer n r de st r p prispallen

5804694 kinesiska r tter lagas utan genuin kryddning eftersom ryktet s ger att v sterl nningar inte t l stark mat
5804695 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5804696 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5804697 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president

5804704 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
5804705 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case
5804706 that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation
5804707 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5804708 sure well do it when you fax us a copy of the death certificate and well waive the cancellation fees
5804709 im sorry was i offending you am i talking too loud
5804710 theres a perception out there that coal is dirty and we have to change that
5804711 kicked in about 9 million this year to an ad campaign touting
5804712 we simply looked at the market for shared office spaces on the less expensive side we found very cool coworking facilities such as workspace in vancouver bc but theyre optimized for solo entrepreneurs or part time visitors on the more expensive side we were quite familiar with regus and did not like the small private offices and the lack of networking opportunities with local members we wanted to build something that would be appealing to global companies large and small with a strong sense of cosmopolitan aesthetics very close to what monocle the magazine is developing we accidentally found the perfect place for a demo facility in palo alto a couple of months ago and the whole project came together very fast after that
5804713 we charge them enough to cover our mortgage and overhead we do not have any full time staff on site we do not need to make much of a profit for the business services component of the venture and can therefore keep our prices low
5804714 working from home is a bad idea and sharing resources is a good idea
5804715 our concept is fairly high end and all inclusive hence a bit too expensive for solo entrepreneurs who are bootstrapping their venture
5804716 whenever we come across such prospects wed like to forward them to a local co working facility we trust in return these co working facilities might want to work with us for accommodating the needs of larger teams or customers requiring slightly more sophisticated equipment and services
5804717 i thought coworking was a way to have the barcamp feeling all the time
5804718 i kept trying to be a catalyst to get someone else in dallas to do it but no one stepped up its a lot of work
5804719 i said ill rent it then i said what should i do with it
5804720 so i said ill just do it for free its not completely altruistic i need to keep this space if i can create good energy around my projects great
5804721 i dont want to be that guy who says no i want to be the good guy
5804722 en nuestro estadio ellos van a estar un poquito m s atr s y esperando esa contra que a ellos les gusta pero esperamos que en el bernabeu y con nuestra gente nos metamos en plena temporada
5804723 no lo veo tan mal y creo que se va a quedar con nosotros ya hab a dicho que tiene mucho m s para darle al madrid y es uno de los jugadores que marca la diferencia
5804724 lo veo muy bien aqu tiene muchos holandeses y eso facilita su adaptaci n todo son gente muy buena y fiable para un vestuario rafael se ha adaptado r pido y estamos muy contentos con l
5804725 no creo que cambie mucho porque lo que se ha hecho est muy bien y aunque cada entrenador tiene sus gustos l ha dicho que cuando uno gana no puede cambiar s lo continuar
5804726 hemos roto el maleficio de los cuartos que creaba ansiedad para jugar
5804727 a los pocos minutos el calor comenz a ser insoportable nos obligaron a dejar todo y marcharnos porque temen que el edificio se pueda venir abajo
5804728 you can go through the whole new album and try and tell me what theyre saying and all youll get over and over again is things are miserable dont try things suck and its all gray theres nothing there never before has there been a greatest band in the world who had so little to say about anything
5804729 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
5804730 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off
5804731 if you put a plane on a treadmill will it be able to take off
5804732 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
5804733 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
5804734 a project focused on replicating amazon apis in an open source cluster environment
5804735 the eucalyptus team has combined several useful open source technologies including mule vde and libvirt into a compelling service layer
5804736 work still remains to incorporate richer networking storage and security capabilities but we look forward to contributing further to building an open cloud ecosystem
5804737 if sites were shops egullet would be selfridges a massive department store trying to cater to all tastes sometimes though i want a boutique operation top of these is dos hermanos the blog of the two half bengali half welsh majumdar brothers who eat out more than is strictly necessary and write very well about it
5804738 simon m and his bro have got to be the rock gods of the uk food blog
5804739 punchily written and stylishly designed recording two food lovers experiences
5804740 two guys who write reviews about mostly london restaurants they are a bit up their own arses but an interesting read anyways
5804741 i think that the imbecil that wrote this 1st don t understand anything about food
5804742 im the house optimist on this question i dont think everybody will make that transition successfully but i think the times will but you know i could not draw you a day by day road map to that destination
5804743 good show so far lets see if we cant fuck it up
5804744 it wasnt really going to work out here the way that we had hoped and he had hoped
5804745 at the same time there are still a couple preseason games left and time before the season opener and i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
5804746 everyone needs a different creative environment and adriano cintra the groups multi instrumentalist and main songwriter hes done music for like 15 years hes such a work aholic and he doesnt mind anything writing for him was kind of a survival thing when bad times came he was just writing and writing more which is very positive
5804747 she translates the portuguese sayings and it doesnt make any sense
5804748 less than half of cios report to the ceo they report to the cfo which suggests that it is still seen as a cost area
5804749 anecdotally cios dont often go on to become ceos because they dont have the right background to talk strategy with them
5804750 our new mba provides a way for cios to set up a move into that type of strategy role
5804751 the it department has itil but once you put a quality framework over the top it becomes applicable to the business and not just to it service management
5804752 i dont work with the agencies or anyone i just work with myself so i choose the people i want to work with on the projects im interested in
5804753 i choose my own schedule i decide where i want to go do i want to go to paris or do i want to go to l a
5804754 i really enjoy it i have a lot of fun i love to travel
5804755 its very lucrative its very easy to get jobs well if you look nice and youre not stupid and on drugs or anything
5804756 we have lots of girls here who are willing to do adult stuff
5804757 more than in toronto for example here i know of dozens of girls
5804758 i would like to model and act myself as long as possible and with adult its very easy
5804759 for sure in mainstream you cannot be a top model at 50 in adult it depends on the niches and if you have your own website if it works well you can work until the day you die
5804760 i dont have an official big agency yet im just starting out to see how i like it
5804761 but instead of singing they perform sex for tv and magazines and all that stuff
5804762 i really like it because before if i was doing some show or photo shoot if it wasnt like a portrait it was to promote some product or to sell something
5804763 she was a little bit worried in the beginning because we came from russia and in russia its different
5804764 but then she saw that everything is fine nobodys on drugs everything is good
5804765 for sure its a very important issue but i work with good companies and good performers experienced ones and we all get tested every three four weeks for all diseases
5804766 within boston it certainly has a reputation for being a party place
5804767 certainly in the bachelor party department montreal has a reputation of being able to fill the requirements
5804768 the first attraction is definitely the strip club i can tell you a lot of foreigners are always looking forward to the contact strip clubs in montreal
5804769 its a growing trend that people go to different destinations for bachelor parties
5804770 it probably gives them a feeling where im not home theres nobody to watch me
5804771 americans definitely come here for that because weve got some pretty sexy girls and were pretty reliable and everything
5804772 weve been known for that for a long time people come here to party
5804773 i dont know this year its pretty dead for the americans
5804774 this year like its not much its more of the montrealers
5804775 montreal since a long time its a fun party destination
5804776 but we dont use the sexual and adult entertainment in our brand i think we have a lot of other things that can attract people in montreal
5804777 most people actually come here for the great restaurants and the reputations of the nightclubs and the reputation of the cute girls of quebec
5804778 believe it or not the adult entertainment out of all the bachelor parties that we organize may make up only 20 per cent of their entire weekend itinerary i think that stat should also be known because a lot of wives out there really are worried
5804779 its just evolved into a really good excuse to get away with all your friends
5804780 montreal is the only canadian city that people will think of to throw a bachelor party
5804781 he cant take on this issue now and win the election wait until he gets into office i think hell do it
5804782 so probably if you laid out a feminist agenda i would probably agree with a large portion of it i wouldnt identify as a feminist just like i probably wouldnt identify as a liberal or a progressive

5804787 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5804788 the types of attacks that are targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and become bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5804789 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks but this new attacks is concerning in one important respect they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5804790 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5804791 persuade government to take holistic view of things and return land
5804792 please persuade the government to take a holistic view of things and return the land let agriculture and industry smile together
5804793 we want the project but let the government settle the issue politically
5804794 sending his industry minister is tantamount to employing delay tactics
5804795 there is land elsewhere at singur which is not so fertile that land could be given
5804796 we do not want to say tata bye bye to either the tatas or the singur farmers we want to see a smile on both their faces
5804797 its encouraging to meet more practitioners on the agency side who walk the talk in many cases as you will see the blogs are created and maintained by individuals as their own personal thinking ground in others they are the effort of a small group on behalf of the agency many i read very regularly some i visit with on occasion

5804800 we had a zero barrier system now there are checks at entry growth in the unit without checks but the system has been scrapped
5804801 policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures

5804803 our director of rugby dai young has been talking to warren to see what wales want to do but jamie has definitely trained at 12
5804804 he is a big strong ball carrying centre but hes also got good foot speed and skills so he is a good choice
5804805 he can cover 15 and wing too but we are just getting him used to playing at 12 with his timing and he is looking good
5804806 if we had won anything there would be pressure to back it up but there are still points to prove in the areas we want to improve on
5804807 we have got to put our heads down because we have got a very tough start
5804808 the actions that home builders are taking right now to keep a lid on new production are slowly but surely helping to bring supply and demand back into balance and put us on the road to a much healthier housing market
5804809 while there is definitely a sense that we are nearing the bottom of the downswing in home sales builders are not ready to start ratcheting up production just yet nor should they be until after sales begin to rebound and the inventory overhang is reduced further
5804810 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available

5804820 high wages with little accountability for actual service delivery make public sector agencies an obvious target for patronage hiring which results at times in massive overstaffing
5804821 while there are millions of dedicated civil servants teachers health workers policemen engineers registration officials attempting to do their jobs well in spite of the systems that work against this it also cannot be denied that all too often attempts to seek services from the public sector encounter workers who are absent incompetent indifferent and outright corrupt
5804822 public sector wages grew much faster than private sector regular job wages or informal casual work real wages in the public sector increased by 44 per cent over this period increasing the public sector premium for observationally equivalent workers from 48 to 68 per cent

5804829 the home entertainment service market in spite of serving close to 120 million tv households for decades has still not delivered the quality choice and service experience leading to customer delight
5804830 there are only six million pay tv dth homes and this will grow ten times to 60 million by 2012 the market is likely to grow to 17 18 million in a year and we plan to have a 40 per cent share of this market at the end of 12 months
5804831 this is the olympic games i didnt even consider it as an option
5804832 the target was within my reach i was in good shape in fact i was in better shape than what i was in athens where she jumped 6 83 her best so far for the sixth place the conditions were very good it is very disappointing to finish like this
5804833 i dont know whether i will be able to jump in the london olympics in 2012 i will be there for the commonwealth games in delhi and the asian games that is the plan for now
5804834 it will be interesting to see at what price the apple iphone launches in india if priced competitively it could garner a significant market share in the smartphone segment given its performance abroad we believe it will generate a good response
5804835 this together with increased competition has not only benefitted iphone sales but also that of its nearest competitors

5804843 we all agree whether we are for or against nuclear power that it should be safe and that means there can be no manipulation or covering up
5804844 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while also reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers
5804845 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5804846 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5804847 we need to start having a serious discussion with government about what options can be put in place

5804857 the world needs better compiler tools tools which are built as libraries this design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways however building the tools as libraries isnt enough they must have clean apis be as decoupled from each other as possible and be easy to modify extend this requires clean layering decent design and keeping the libraries independent of any specific client
5804858 in essence the judge appears to conclude that fox retained distribution rights in watchmen through the 1991 largo quitclaim and he concludes that under the 1994 turnaround producer larry gordon acquired an option to acquire foxs remaining interest in watchmen that was never exercised thereby leaving fox with its rights under the 1994 agreement
5804859 while the judges opinion is preliminary and his views could change in the course of the litigation his current take on the facts is consistent with our position
5804860 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation
5804861 the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5804862 fox sat on its so called rights for years while other studios in town developed this property in fact paramount greenlit the movie for production and fox never said a word fox even had an opportunity to re acquire the project at some point and it passed on it
5804863 warner brothers production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates twentieth century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
5804864 quitclaims to purchaser all of foxs right title and interest in and to the motion picture project presently entitled watchmen which included specifically described literary materials
5804865 if purchaser elects to proceed to production the picture shall be produced by purchaser and shall be distributed by fox as a subject picture pursuant to the terms of the largo agreement
5804866 the perpetual right to acquire all of the right title and interest of fox watchmen pursuant to the terms and conditions herein provided

5804880 we have henrik larsson as captain tomorrow and i hope we can do quite well
5804881 henrik larsson is still a great player he is probably the best player in the swedish league he is a very strong player
5804882 its not an economic model we want to project but project we must
5804883 first for one thing another round of large write offs would as they say end all doubt regarding a u s recession we would record negative gdp for q3 and q4 at minimum most likely for q1 2009 as well
5804884 second youre looking at additional consolidation in investment banking and commercial banking
5804885 third there would be considerable u s government involvement the scope and amount of intervention by the u s treasury and fed u s federal reserve is difficult to specify until the size of the problem is known
5804886 would most likely propel congressionally backed federally directed structural changes in banking mortgage finance securities and financial regulation
5804887 its one thing if the nature of the bailout is another 50 or 100 billion but if it amounts to the takeover of a large bank or fre the american economy would see its biggest changes since the new deal
5804888 these changes would most likely end once and for all the heads the banks win tails the government pays banking system youd most likely see a two tier banking system
5804889 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5804890 simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under
5804891 he rogoff used pretty strong language and i take a slightly different stance losses will be significant but from here to the economys recovery were looking at managed losses
5804892 the fed is ready to provide liquidity the u s treasury is back stopping fannie mae and freddie mac so while the losses could be large the reserve capital in the form of public funds is larger
5804893 we got beat by three teams last year and we are going to look to avenge those
5804894 i think ultimately alaska coming in to town is going to be a huge match but traveling to both army and kentucky will be tough as well
5804895 tcu has built a great program over the last three four years
5804896 its nice to have them on the schedule that will be a really tough match and im interested to see how it goes
5804897 ultimately we want to peak this season in february and march when qualifiers the conference championships and the ncaa championships take place
5804898 we want to be at a level where we know we can compete with any team out there
5804899 the person we dislike is still a soul for whom christ died
5804900 nepals chief of the army staff rookmangad katawal looked pretty annoyed at the time of the swearing in ceremony
5804901 left the rastrapati bhawan without congratulating the newly elected prime minister dahal
5804902 the security of the prime minister is the responsibility of the national army
5804903 this decision made by the party of the ex rebels does make it clear that the maoists are still plagued with the war mindset
5804904 this is the result of the maoists dictatorial mindset which in itself is tantamount to a very unfortunate decision
5804905 the nepal army that is under the ministry of defense and the police force under the ministry of home affairs were the most corrupt institutions in nepal the security mechanism in the country is the most corrupt the police force itself is preserving corruption four months after the elections to the ca constituent assembly the delay in the formation of the government is a proof in itself that foul play is in progress to hide acts of corruption in the country
5804906 nepal itself continues to remain an outsider alongside other asian ldcs that have enjoyed higher rates of growth over recent years and are making faster progress in transforming their economies away from a dependence on commodities towards manufacturing and services
5804907 we need a much greater sense of urgency amongst all those responsible to get nepal out of the ldcs club only effective economic policies that create employment increase agricultural productivity and reduce dependence on commodities can ensure that growth when it comes will translate into poverty reduction
5804908 i think there has to be equal representation from businesses who didnt pay a lot of money who are being forced to pay an assessment fee
5804909 we have so many different people that will be affected by this we want to make sure theyve addressed all the concerns

5804911 theyre just not successful in any school cant hold a job might have a son and daughter at home
5804912 i just decided that if i cant get the education that i need what is the point of wasting my time and going so i decided to start working
5804913 the thing we are most concerned with right now is the reading
5804914 i have to say honestly i think i would have dropped out
5804915 my mom thought you were gay but upon further inspection she was confusing you and dave attell dont worry she still thought you were gay she just thought when i was seeing dave attell live that i was seeing you a gay dude love holly
5804916 floods in the cuu long river delta happen every year so people are used to taking preventive measures for crops and life
5804917 in the past floods caused problem to transportation and it was hard for children to come to school but in recent years vietnam has built protective dykes and residential areas above the flood peaking level
5804918 since the floods are to wash away alum we expect the yield of the next winter spring rice crop to be good at least on par with this year
5804919 floods are forecast to rise above the average level in many years
5804920 a directive order has been issued to the government to provide basic
5804921 this means the childs rights cant be violated in the name of culture
5804922 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5804923 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5804924 we need to start having a serious discussion with government about what options can be put in place
5804925 for the people by the people and of the people
5804926 i am talking of odds against chance of hundreds of thousands to one

5804929 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while also reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers

5804965 the great thing about innovating at nike is that we have iconic heritage products to draw from
5804966 at nike we have a fascination with one piece uppers
5804967 weve done one piece air force 1 and nike dunk shoes but we always wanted to add more stability flywire finally allows us to design a high performance shoe with one piece of material against the foot this innovation not only adds comfort by removing anything that could cause a hotspot in the shoe but also drastically reduces weight

5804971 all of us volunteer so all of this is just another opportunity for us to serve its not any more valuable or important than what you guys do in your community and churches joel houston the bands leader says one thing that keeps their egos in check is a realization of their role in the body of christ and how they are just representatives of a body of believers in sydney australia who serve god in many different ways he says it also helps that team members hold each other accountable to ensure that their individual relationships with god are stronger than ever we sing songs that try to move attention away from us as much as possible we remember from whence we came we know where we started out and we know that we are part of something thats much bigger than ourselves so its important that we always remember that if we get too full of ourselves and how great we are we lose the whole plot of what were all about we want to be about singing songs that give glory to god and hopefully reach out to people
5804972 i guess when youre a kid you always have dreams where you want to be in a band and you want to do something but then there comes a certain point when you have to trust god with your life and you say yeah god im going to serve you im giving you everything that ive got and god has a funny way of making your dreams happen

5804980 proponents of this legislation have done nothing to address the real issue of unwanted horses
5804981 unwanted horses in the us are facing a crisis the aaep believes the option of sending a horse to a processing plant is the best way of reducing the unwanted horse population the bill doesnt address the long term care and funding that would be necessary to help the many horses affected by a ban

5804992 we are pleased to see lecroys long time commitment to providing usb verification tools continue with support for usb 3 0
5804993 test tools like the lecroy voyager system will help developers bring usb 3 0 products to market quickly while ensuring backward compatibility with usb 2 0
5804994 the voyager is the obvious choice for usb developers targeting 3 0 or even considering superspeed testing in the future
5804995 it includes best in class 2 0 analysis features and it is the only future proof platform that is easily upgradeable to support the emerging superspeed usb standard

5804998 the ecrs developed in partnership of the apwg and ieee will attract and cultivate the most advanced research in electronic crime studies enriching the research community in industry and academeand at the same time helping the ieee forge and inform standards to help protect the internet
5804999 it has been gratifying to see the researchers whove attended and presented at the ecrime conferences grow into a community of interest around this essential sub genre of the information security disciplines we have every confidence that developing the conference in collaboration with ieee will help it achieve the global scope and technical depth that the ecrs and community forming around it deserves
5805000 this collaboration makes the most of both institutions roles apwgs brief to promote understanding of electronic crime and to organize responses to it and ieees charter to foster technological innovation for the benefit of humanity we are honored beyond words to work with ieee to help to make the internet a safer place

5805177 joining the linux foundation is an indication of our growing presence within both linux and the wider open source community particularly in the enterprise space
5805178 we believe that ubuntu is gaining traction in enterprise deployments at the server level as well as on the desktop and its good for us to have ways to communicate this
5805179 i think it is significant that canonical is joining the linux foundation they have been involved closely with us since the inception of the foundation they participate in the linux standard base for instance they attend our collaboration summits and mark shuttleworth founder and ceo of canonical is on the board as an individual member by officially joining they are putting resources behind our work and more than anything showing they value that work
5805180 we have a huge global user base and tremendous backing from our community who ultimately make ubuntu possible
5805181 these people have a strong voice and their advocacy around the world is driving linux adoption at all levels from mobile devices to the cloud
5805182 membership gives us a voice within a key influencing organization and visibility to the growing corporate membership of the foundation
5805183 we see acceptance of linux in major corporations and public sector organizations accelerating and the foundation is doing a great job in supporting that
5805184 the linux foundation occupies a critical non commercial function in the use and popularization of linux around the world weve always seen the linux foundations value and are pleased to now become an official member and support its activities
5805185 we look forward to working with them to continue the march of linux in all areas of computing
5805186 there is no question that the ubuntu distribution has advanced the state of linux on the desktop
5805187 their focus on usability and branding is being felt throughout the industry
5805188 i dont work with the agencies or anyone i just work with myself so i choose the people i want to work with on the projects im interested in
5805189 i choose my own schedule i decide where i want to go do i want to go to paris or do i want to go to l a
5805190 i really enjoy it i have a lot of fun i love to travel
5805191 its very lucrative its very easy to get jobs well if you look nice and youre not stupid and on drugs or anything
5805192 we have lots of girls here who are willing to do adult stuff
5805193 more than in toronto for example here i know of dozens of girls
5805194 i would like to model and act myself as long as possible and with adult its very easy
5805195 for sure in mainstream you cannot be a top model at 50 in adult it depends on the niches and if you have your own website if it works well you can work until the day you die
5805196 i dont have an official big agency yet im just starting out to see how i like it
5805197 but instead of singing they perform sex for tv and magazines and all that stuff
5805198 i really like it because before if i was doing some show or photo shoot if it wasnt like a portrait it was to promote some product or to sell something
5805199 she was a little bit worried in the beginning because we came from russia and in russia its different
5805200 but then she saw that everything is fine nobodys on drugs everything is good
5805201 for sure its a very important issue but i work with good companies and good performers experienced ones and we all get tested every three four weeks for all diseases
5805202 within boston it certainly has a reputation for being a party place
5805203 certainly in the bachelor party department montreal has a reputation of being able to fill the requirements
5805204 the first attraction is definitely the strip club i can tell you a lot of foreigners are always looking forward to the contact strip clubs in montreal
5805205 its a growing trend that people go to different destinations for bachelor parties
5805206 it probably gives them a feeling where im not home theres nobody to watch me
5805207 americans definitely come here for that because weve got some pretty sexy girls and were pretty reliable and everything
5805208 weve been known for that for a long time people come here to party
5805209 i dont know this year its pretty dead for the americans
5805210 this year like its not much its more of the montrealers
5805211 montreal since a long time its a fun party destination
5805212 but we dont use the sexual and adult entertainment in our brand i think we have a lot of other things that can attract people in montreal
5805213 most people actually come here for the great restaurants and the reputations of the nightclubs and the reputation of the cute girls of quebec
5805214 believe it or not the adult entertainment out of all the bachelor parties that we organize may make up only 20 per cent of their entire weekend itinerary i think that stat should also be known because a lot of wives out there really are worried
5805215 its just evolved into a really good excuse to get away with all your friends
5805216 montreal is the only canadian city that people will think of to throw a bachelor party
5805217 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5805218 western leaders have been in denial about the true extent of taliban presence in afghanistan
5805219 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5805220 we of course are very proud to have the french making an enhanced contribution in afghanistan
5805221 its essential for all nato countries to stay the course so that we accomplish our objectives of creating a stable environment
5805222 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5805223 without hesitation we said to cbs bosses laurence fishburne should take the part he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5805224 yes i get it black people were slaves here once you know what that does suck some major balls however it is time to move the fuck on
5805225 do we hear the jews crying that they were made slaves for thousands of years do we hear them whine that they should own the pyramids in egypt because they broke their backs making them do we hear them bitch and moan about hitler etc my hubby is a jew nope we dont
5805226 if any other race had a chanel dedicated to just them we would think it was racist if any other race demanded a month be set aside for only them they would be considered racist
5805227 i will no longer tune into bet this is going to suck but i do not like the idea of having a chanel for only 1 race in the year 2007 in a country that is supposed to be the most advanced and equal this is unexceptable i will also no longer acknowledge black history month
5805228 when i was a kid there was an ice storm in the suburbs we went to manhattan to stay with a friend of my moms there was nobody on the road it was this moment that couldve been scary for a kid but she made it festive
5805229 thats what nick is like he takes the hard part of a situation and makes it celebratory
5805230 i can clean up pretty nice but im funny looking my ears have been the same size since i was five
5805231 we are very pleased to have someone of richards talent and experience to take on this very important role
5805232 quality service and support are hallmarks of filmlight and richard has a deep commitment to helping clients get the most out of their technology
5805233 its an exciting opportunity to join a forward thinking company whose products have gained widespread acceptance and respect throughout the film and television industries
5805234 i am especially excited to be able to work with filmlight products in asian markets where there is enormous potential for growth
5805235 good show so far lets see if we cant fuck it up
5805236 nbc universals coverage of this years summer games is raising the bar for live event streaming from the volume of live streams and the massive amount of on demand content to the quality of the end user experience everything about this initiative is changing how content consumers will look at live event coverage from this point forward
5805237 never before have live event viewers had this much control over what they watch and how they watch it and were ecstatic to be part of this phenomenal effort the future of online event coverage is brighter than ever and we look forward to our next challenge as multi platform distribution continues to revolutionize viewing experiences
5805238 we do seven taping days a week over a five day period five days here in our manhattan studio and two days in the field we use a total of 18 canon xh g1 camcorders and shoot 10 to 12 hour days three cameras at a time or four cameras out in the field we produce 250 shows per year we also have one canon xl h1 we use its wide angle lens for establishing shots
5805239 there are absolutely performances and moments that we would not have been able to capture if it were not for the low weight and small size of these cameras
5805240 a primary reason that i recommended its acquisition was its 20x built in zoom as well as the canon ef 1
5805241 i am a nature documentary filmmaker and often times have to make do with little or no crew
5805242 larger format cameras are too bulky to carry and set up easily some of the storage options for other hdv cameras are too expensive and impractical for non scripted programs that can easily generate hundreds of hours of footage the canon xl h1 was really the only current option for my needs a high quality lens with good zoom capability on a lightweight camera body with inexpensive high def media acquisition
5805243 the canon xh g1 and xl h1 hd camcorders gave us everything we needed
5805244 the xl h1 gave us the great option of interchangeable lenses although it turned out that the 20x hd zoom lens provided with the camera gave us all the framing we wanted the biggest selling points for both the canon xl h1 and the canon xh g1 however were their industry standard connections hd sdi output time code in out and genlock input which enables us to slave all these cameras together once we started doing our homework on these cameras we discovered all the hidden treasures that they have
5805245 we can quickly break off the cameras from their tripods in the back of the room and run outside to get reaction shots
5805246 that saves money because we dont need a separate eng crew to do that
5805247 the industry is definitely being shaped and changed especially by these cameras
5805248 its really bridging the gap between industrial and broadcast where the limitations arent as clear anymore were very happy with our xh g1 and xl h1 hd camcorders from canon u s a
5805249 the hdmon 260 represents an extension of our industry leading line of hd video monitoring solutions
5805250 the advanced lcd technology incorporated into the hdmon series along with flexible control and configuration options allow our customers to deploy cutting edge monitoring technology that meets both their application and budgetary requirements
5805251 its a convergence product that delivers seamless switching for both live events and broadcast video the hs400 has represented tremendous savings for us in terms of time space and energy
5805252 you can mix many signal types the switcher accepts sd hd and computer inputs and you can output virtually anything for projection or broadcast
5805253 the hs400 is fully digital with frame synchronizers that can eliminate the need for traditional genlock and timing adjustments a big time saver
5805254 you turn it on and no other set up is required other than white balancing the cameras
5805255 we now feed up to eight inputs from our cameras to one 42 inch plasma for the director
5805256 this means weve been able to eliminate four racks of crt monitors and traditional terminal gear representing up to 1 500 pounds and sizeable power consumption now we simply travel with one or two camera control racks and a second plasma display for the engineer
5805257 the upshot was that we didnt need a separate computer to feed the logo anything you can do to reduce gear and cabling is a bonus
5805258 we anticipate that the hs400 will provide excellent support to our broadcast clients
5805259 wggb for instance has no mobile production truck but with four cameras and a switcher well be able to handle all the stations local cut ins during the mda telethon
5805260 the switchers ability to route physical inputs to any input number has proved very desirable
5805261 it may seem like a small matter but ive had experience with touring video directors who stipulate specific numbers assigned to inputs and ive been able to accommodate their requests also for corporate work we appreciate being able to intercut powerpoint presentations with live video while preserving the high resolution being output by the computer
5805262 rsr has always had huge ambitions for cinespace and weve worked hard over the last several years to create an industry leading product and a respected brand that is highly focussed upon delivering value to our clients this deal represents a realisation of that potential enabling cinespace to leverage the resources and strategic vision of cine tal to grow further innovate faster and to scale the delivery of its world renowned solutions to the benefit of our clients
5805263 weve been working with cine tal for some time now to take the cinespace product line and extend it both functionally and to other parts of the market the integration of cinespace with current and future technology creates a long term solution in color and display management
5805264 by combining our display management software and display hardware products with the proven cinespace colour management software we are providing a comprehensive solution for colour management and display management
5805265 and we are committed to providing our customers with the very best technology for collaborating processing and displaying visual media
5805266 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5805267 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5805268 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5805269 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5805270 some of my members are supporting it and some of my members are very much against it
5805271 we really want to hear from our members and do some due diligence
5805272 why was i not allowed to be at that meeting
5805273 thats wrong im a board member its a subcommittee and the subcommittee serves at the pleasure of the board
5805274 i would resign from the board because i would not serve on a board thats not transparent and that operated in an exclusive fashion
5805275 we follow roberts rules of order and when we discuss issues that would potentially result in a vote the only members that could stay are the voting members
5805276 and steve was not aware of that and hes very passionate about the bond measure
5805277 gord dineen is a top young coach with a lengthy and impressive resume as a player and as a coach

5805286 this really bugs me why does someone get credit for just naming and distilling something that already exists
5805287 well naming things is important and he was part of the effort to create the thing the web so he should get some of the credit
5805288 hmm i still dont get it can you give me an example from outside of the world of technology

5805305 i applaud our state board of education today for recognizing that even in harsh economic times florida cannot continue to shortchange our childrens future with further cuts to education the recommended 1 billion increase in spending for the 2009 2010 school year will help restore some of the painful education cuts of the republican legislature

5805324 lo ideal hubiera sido jugar con una selecci n para estar en nivel y agarrar ritmo de competencia es incomodo estar solo una parte de los jugadores somos un grupo reducido a n pero cuando estemos los dem s las cosas ser n distintas
5805325 es bueno que la gente se ilusione con la convocatoria hay un grupo de gente nueva que seguramente estar dispuesta dar lo mejor de s para el objetivo todos se quieren mostrar para intentar quedarse y repetir convocatoria
5805326 creo que mejor hubiese sido jugar con un equipo de peso o al menos un partido internacional pero ya no se puede hacer nada hay que trabajar con lo que tenemos y de la mejor manera para sacar adelante esta situaci n

5805331 since theres so many bills before congress its there but nobody really knew about it
5805332 its one of the most touching stories ive ever heard

5805337 all our travel plans were thrown into chaos but we managed to get to baku and obtain the visas to travel
5805338 we then had to rearrange our travel schedule because the airport was closed and there were no international flights im sure someone in russia thought they would break us down and we wouldnt travel to wales but we made it
5805339 of course we are missing a lot of players and not because of injury we have players who play in russia and they could not get to baku for their visas so they will not play
5805340 our new coach hector cuper hasnt had the chance to meet the players properly in georgia so he does not know them at all
5805341 the squad is not perfect but this gives the youngsters a chance to become a player of the national team

5805353 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
5805354 the committee has investigated this allegation of two homeless individuals allegedly being paid 1 00 for their signatures and found it to be completely false and so we have asked bill faith to immediately retract this false allegation and any references to it on his website or any other website maintained by his organizations
5805355 the committee has diligently investigated this allegation and has determined that it is completely and utterly false and without any foundation in fact as you are acutely aware the committee did not obtain the attorney generals certification of its summary of the law to be referred until late in the day on july 10 2008 consequently allowing time for the printing of the petition forms circulation of the committees referendum petition did not begin until july 12 2008 it was therefore impossible for either mr schirmer or ms smithers to have signed the committees referendum petition in june let alone to have been paid for doing so

5805362 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5805363 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister

5805368 only rarely do archeologists come across findings of significant figures in history which help lift the dust of history and bring the biblical story to life in such a tangible way

5805375 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5805376 all the evidence so far indicates that these qualitative differences in nutrition are causal in determining caste though were missing the final link in order to determine if it was casual
5805377 there are some cases where nature completely wins out but all of this is telling us theres a nice interaction between nature and nurture across most social insects
5805378 the benefit to the colony in having the nurture part is that it allows flexibility
5805379 they can quickly and easily change what caste theyre producing to fit their environment better but having the nature component benefits the individual because it can bias its development toward becoming reproductive its a balance between what the individual wants versus what the colony wants
5805380 i started exercising and i started eating more of the right food and i started feeling better i just get up in the morning and say my prayers
5805381 i think the new album is just as good as anything the beach boys ever recorded
5805382 van dyke parks brian and melinda thought this should be a love letter to los angeles at this point brian was 65 years old and it just felt right to embrace his legend and be a bit nostalgic
5805383 kind of introspective kind of how i feel around people
5805384 yes brian had a rough time of it with his mental health but i would kill to have the kind of catalog he does and tour everywhere with his brothers like he did
5805385 when i go to the keyboard i feel holy like an angel over my head i feel very holy when we did the beach boys hit god only knows i felt holy about that too a godly something comes through me
5805386 im always thinking about melodies the melodies come from my brain and my keyboards i play a really pleasant keyboard it sounds so pleasant it makes me want to write melodies
5805387 i see this being used from a planners perspective we talk about having a seat at the table this clearly demonstrates that a face to face meeting is imperative especially in a soft economy
5805388 ive been in this industry for over 20 years and i manage very large events so i see the in and out flow of funds

5805394 things i idiotically saw and will now force you to see because misery loves company
5805395 if denver founders it will be with a giant thud
5805396 if the district continues efforts to fiddle around with bonuses versus salary building
5805397 it hurts our efforts to say yes its okay to try something new and different
5805398 he served 22 years with great vision and integrity and all who love wake forest are grateful for his legacy of achievement and the place the institution holds in american higher education
5805399 no puede mantener una relaci n con rusia como hasta ahora en las circunstancias actuales
5805400 el futuro de nuestras relaciones depender de las acciones concretas que rusia impulse para hacer honor a las palabras del presidente
5805401 hasta la posici n que manten an antes del 6 de agosto
5805402 de momento no hay se ales de pasos rusos en el sentido de retirarse
5805403 todav a esperamos la retirada de sus tropas estamos muy decepcionados porque pese a las promesas que nos hicieron no ha habido retirada
5805404 los rusos deben respetar la firma y deben retirar sus tropas
5805405 intentamos buscar unos y otros medidas de presi n suficientes para que los rusos cumplan en la pr ctica lo que han prometido
5805406 por el momento no hemos tomado medidas que nos separen y refuercen la confrontaci n
5805407 no se har nada con rusia sin que haya una retirada de tropas
5805408 no hemos regresado a la poca de la guerra fr a aunque parezca
5805409 har n falta 10 quiz 20 a os para reparar el da o que se ha hecho
5805410 no soy partidario de una confrontaci n entre los bloques de la guerra fr a
5805411 la otan no va a permitir que se cree una l nea divisoria en europa entre quienes tuvieron la suficiente suerte para ingresar en las estructuras transatl nticas y quienes todav a aspiran a ingresar en ellas
5805412 no se trata de obligar a pa ses a ingresar en una alianza o en otra sino de permitirles una decisi n libre
5805413 georgia puede convertirse en miembro de la otan y en mi opini n se convertir un d a en miembro de la alianza la decisi n de bucarest se mantiene
5805414 supervisar la cooperaci n con georgia en una amplia gama de asuntos y supervisar el calendario para alcanzar los objetivos suscritos en bucarest
5805415 para ayudar al gobierno georgiano a valorar el da o cr tico contra la infraestructura civil
5805416 el estado de su ministerio de defensa y las fuerzas armadas georgianas
5805417 la otan tiene intenci n de apoyar la integridad territorial de georgia
5805418 hace falta que rusia haga honor al compromiso adoptado por su presidente
5805419 el repliegue de todas las fuerzas que no estaban en osetia del sur cuando estall el conflicto
5805420 los efectivos de mantenimiento de paz rusos que estaban all antes del estallido son una cosa pero los refuerzos en la zona de conflicto tambi n deben replegarse
5805421 la alianza atl ntica ha asumido de hecho a saakashvili bajo su protecci n
5805422 no dice c mo ha comenzado todo ni qui n ha armado a georgia ni qui n ha impedido a tiblisi concluir un acuerdo sobre la inadmisibilidad del recurso a la fuerza durante un a o
5805423 el comportamiento de rusia en esta crisis reciente est aislando a rusia
5805424 cuando se invade a los vecinos peque os se bombardea infraestructura civil y se penetra en pueblos para crear caos eso es lo que a sla a rusia
5805425 mientras este tipo de actividades contin e no puede haber una relaci n como antes con rusia
5805426 i know you above all others and you have also found favour in my sight
5805427 thou hast put on praise and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment
5805428 ok everyone heres a reminder of the few shows you have left this year to catch orange goblin live before they head into the studio to begin work on a new album scheduled to be recorded in early 2009 and released before the summer of 2009
5805429 the new album global drama is now released all over europe usa and canada so dont hesitate to go and purchase it
5805430 the band is back home after a great weekend of metal in norway and holland
5805431 innovative rahmen und die linsen erh hen die feuchtigkeit im auge
5805432 wir arbeiten an ein paar problemen die rund zwei prozent der verkauften iphones betreffen und hoffen daf r schon bald ein update zur verf gung stellen zu k nnen
5805433 i am very skeptical in regards to these venture investors way of breaking up companies
5805434 it is they who will destroy the national capitalist structures
5805435 to move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy
5805436 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5805437 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5805438 the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5805439 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5805440 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5805441 for all his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell
5805442 senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan
5805443 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will
5805444 our troops have performed magnificently and violence is genuinely down but listen if you drive a bus into a ditch and then after five years and a trillion dollars and 4 000 lives lost you are getting the bus halfway out of the ditch it doesnt mean you made a good decision driving the bus off the road in the first place
5805445 selling the unit would be tantamount to selling a ships anchor in the midst of a storm
5805446 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
5805447 so much the better if that happens i think they need to take a stance
5805448 its a hard subject for me to discuss because i hate whats going on there but banning a team or banning a game of cricket will that change the situation in zimbabwe the answers probably no
5805449 obviously ireland is a very important fixture for us theyre the team we measure ourselves against just now at associate level
5805450 but new zealand is another opportunity for us to get ourselves a test scalp theres no pressure on us there
5805451 its just a chance to see if we can pull something off and see what we can do
5805452 every aspect of the workings of zimbawe cricket including the allegation that only members of ruling party zanu pf are eligible to play
5805453 zimbabwe has agreed not to participate in the wider interest of cricket
5805454 but we will continue to be a full member of the icc and welcome any team that wants to play against us
5805455 we voluntarily agreed to back out of the world twenty20 because we were told we wont get visas to england we dont want to gatecrash where we are not welcome
5805456 by agreeing to withdraw from the world twenty20 zimbabwe have agreed to act in the interests of world cricket thus avoiding the likelihood of that tournament being moved elsewhere and the added spectre of boycotted matches and possibly strikes by players
5805457 i welcome the fact that zimbabwe will not play in the world twenty20 in england next year
5805458 the government made it clear that in the current circumstances the team whose figurehead is mr mugabe would not be welcome
5805459 while i would have preferred the icc to take a stronger stance against zimbabwe cricket this solution still allows individual cricket authorities to make their own choices over whether to play zimbabwe
5805460 this will allow the twenty20 tournament in england to go ahead
5805461 it also sends a powerful message to zimbabwe that the government must change or face further isolation
5805462 this matter led to a complex and lengthy series of negotiations
5805463 weve had long discussions with our colleagues on the icc over the last three days and were grateful they saw the point of view we held
5805464 we dont live in a vacuum people can see whats going on and politicians are making political decisions based on the political situation in zimbabwe
5805465 as a sporting organisation we make decisions based on cricket and even if we wanted to its unlikely political considerations are at the forefront
5805466 she is so kind sweet and very beautiful shes also very funny which always is a great thing shes also very much like me she makes me very happy it feels real and honest and i have more of a continuous smile than i have ever had before
5805467 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit
5805468 i dont recall anything as big since the decade of the civil war
5805469 for extremists to target police is like hitting a symbol of repression it can help them rally a segment of the population
5805470 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5805471 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
5805472 no one should be afraid of this if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
5805473 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5805474 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5805475 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5805476 a great loss for the african continent which appreciated his political courage and a great loss for democracy of which he was an ardent defender all his life
5805477 may our beloved president mwanawasas soul rest in eternal peace of our lord jesus
5805478 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5805479 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5805480 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5805481 we cannot cooperate any more with an organisation which works with criminals
5805482 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5805483 there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real
5805484 we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
5805485 a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5805486 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
5805487 at this time action is being instigated against the perpetrators
5805488 is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception
5805489 requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance expected from the marketing and promotion
5805490 sorry that my name and stanfords name have been brought into this
5805491 but i cant imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence of bigfoot anything has a remote chance of being true but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real
5805492 i dont think the word lobbying is correct we have merely stated our position
5805493 we zimbabwe are a full member of fifa and are currently participating in a world cup qualifying campaign we have a swimming programme which has produced kirsty coventry a recent winner in the world championships
5805494 so it would be strange that the only sport to take action on so called current worries is cricket when all the other world sporting bodies have not taken that stance
5805495 i cannot speculate on the outcome but we have obviously noted the actions of others
5805496 over the last few years there have been problems between england and zimbabwe this is not a new phenomena
5805497 in the past thereve been chances to show the strength of feeling here and the government chose not to
5805498 if it comes down to players to do that well definitely have to look at it
5805499 theres a great sense among the general population that our last tour to zimbabwe shouldnt have gone ahead
5805500 it has come down to a certain extent to personal preference and there have been some tough decisions made in previous tours
5805501 when we come round to the issue again we all hope that the political situation in zimbabwe is very different
5805502 but if it isnt there are going to be more very difficult decisions to be made
5805503 were not going to get rid of the forms the forms will simply die
5805504 idea keeps the sec on the cutting edge of technology and makes sure the information investors get is more accessible and more reliable
5805505 no one likes to do it but you become more functional and efficient once you do
5805506 it might not have been the best way to do it but with the conditions being so tricky it was the best way of making sure of gold
5805507 its been a testing week but i hung in there and delivered yesterday which made it a bit easier today
5805508 the market is now focusing on how well the coalition government can resolve the remaining issues
5805509 there is no deal he resigned himself and as far as his accountability is concerned coalition partners will decide
5805510 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition due to injury
5805511 there is basically no worry about top spot on the gold medal table
5805512 since then there has been a clash going on between nato and the taliban six taliban were killed after they blew up the bombs they had on their bodies two children have been killed and two more along with a woman have been wounded
5805513 we had up to six suicide bombers on foot some of the bombers were able to blow themselves up outside the base and some have been killed by our forces
5805514 the firefight is still ongoing there are no casualties on our own side
5805515 como de la eliminaci n de un elemento estrat gico que har a el juego m s divertido al menos para m elegir qu armas llevar y cu ndo y contra qui n utilizarlas tal vez sea un concepto para
5805516 we will have it after the ipl or well try to fit it in at a later time it is a minor thing
5805517 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5805518 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5805519 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5805520 it was determined during the quarter that additional allowances for loan losses would be made to absorb losses in our loan portfolio related to the further decline in the real estate market in our areas of operation
5805521 management has concerns about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms
5805522 there was little food left in our house it is good they have called off protests for sometime
5805523 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5805524 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5805525 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5805526 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5805527 students have the ability to cause significant harm to the charlieticket system during the roughly five month window that remedial actions will require
5805528 wenbit confirms and adds further evidence to results from previously published and similar homocysteine lowering b vitamin trials in populations with established or at increased risk of cardiovascular disease
5805529 both in norvit and in wenbit there was a numerically larger incidence of cancer in the groups treated with folic acid and vitamin b 12 and although this could be due to chance the possible harmful effects of folic acid treatment supplementation on cancer development should be explored
5805530 incident cancers will be one of the clinical end points in this analysis
5805531 there is no reason now to lower homocysteine levels but it is still too early to write off the hypothesis completely
5805532 if you have commented on gosmelltheflowers com earlier you will need to
5805533 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5805534 the types of attacks that are targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and become bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5805535 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks but this new attacks is concerning in one important respect they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5805536 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5805537 the swearing in would take place on monday or tuesday to enable new legislators to execute the mandate they were given by the people
5805538 the preparations for the swearing in of members of the seventh parliament since independence are at an advanced stage
5805539 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5805540 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5805541 theyll find another fake issue to focus on and then another
5805542 politicians use the poor when its convenient to chant slogans but really its all about power
5805543 all bilateral arrangements are suspended with zimbabwe cricket with immediate effect
5805544 the ecb deplores the position in zimbabwe and like csa finds this untenable
5805545 we welcome the governments decision and share the governments concerns about the deteriorating situation and lack of human rights in zimbabwe
5805546 we want to ensure that zimbabwe do not tour england next year
5805547 we will call on other countries to join us in banning zimbabwe
5805548 the only acceptable non compliance as its called is a clear instruction from government or a security situation
5805549 the secretary of state burnham made it clear there was a clear instruction and we have acted to it straight away
5805550 the right thing to do was to provide clarity we made the decision after giving it the longest possible time for the situation to change in zimbabwe
5805551 i hope the cricketing community in this country and the wider world will understand the reasons why i have done that
5805552 we do have contingency plans in case any tour is cancelled
5805553 we are already in consultation with other boards about the possibility of another country coming in to play two tests and three one day internationals at the start of next year to replace exactly the programme zimbabwe would have undertaken
5805554 the ecb looked for this sort of reaction from the government to stop them going on tour to zimbabwe in 2004
5805555 but the government didnt give them that and they had to go and felt very uncomfortable about it
5805556 that is part of the hosting agreement for any major world event but we cant second guess on how the icc meeting will progress next week
5805557 unless zimbabwe are suspended from the icc next week it still has the right to play international tournaments
5805558 it is a very delicate situation for the government and the ecb seven out of 10 around the table at the icc have to vote to expel zimbabwe
5805559 we recognised we british government are not the principal decision makers here this is a tournament organised by the icc but we have made our views explicitly clear
5805560 the medical literature on the subject contains nothing really worth reading

5805566 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
5805567 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5805568 if that were true wouldnt one expect at least one of the landowners to ask for something in writing
5805569 wouldnt there be one piece of historical evidence supporting that allegation

5805578 but now at the 11th hour monarch and jpmorgan are balking at the proposal and large hedge funds and banks are toying with the livelihoods of thousands of ibc workers

5805644 i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount

5805738 wimax has gained such momentum across so many regions that it is no longer sensible to suggest that wimax growth will be flattened by the emergence of lte in the next few years in populous countries with poor national telecom infrastructure such as india brazil and africa there is a lack of broadband services and even of basic voice services which is a significant driver for wimax adoption in many developing countries with india being the prime example wimax is showing promising signs of becoming the primary broadband infrastructure and a prominent 3g mobile technology india is absolutely critical to the fortunes of wimax and the level of uptake there will help decide how prominent a position 802 16e takes in the overall wireless landscape in the next decade

5805742 the improvement is principally the result of new brand programs within the us and with our sales expansion within southeast asia particularly china for our zipper and trim products the demand for a quality global supply alternative within the zipper market is strong and talon represents the leading solution for a growing number of major brand retailers additionally the refocusing of our sales force that we announced in march is beginning to reflect the synergies we expected within all of our product lines
5805743 however we are beginning to see modest results from our sales and marketing efforts over the last year with a growing interest in and adoption of the technology by new customers

5805750 a recent pew poll found obama trailing sen john mccain among white evangelicals mainline protestants and non hispanic catholics
5805751 we want people of faith to know that barack obama is a viable option and a candidate whos not ashamed to stand up and talk about his values
5805752 democrats have developed a keen awareness of the problem and theyre seriously engaged in trying to narrow the gap
5805753 that in itself is a significant change from 2000 and 2004
5805754 is the extent to which we allow people of faith to be a vibrant active part of the party because that is a longer term benefit with greater implications than what one election may or may not yield

5805760 an informed and dispassionate debate over the issue and the federal highway law that made 21 the de facto national drinking age by denying money to any state that bucks the trend
5805761 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5805762 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5805763 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5805764 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5805765 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5805766 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5805767 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5805768 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him

5805771 a 10 hike in aeronautical charges in third year of operation was allowed in the agreements with both gmr and gvk groups for delhi and mumbai airports respectively mumbai international airport pvt ltd mial has been pursuing this demand as its financial model has been based on higher revenues in third year and it is being considered at highest level in the ministry
5805772 the market situation is getting tougher for infrastructure developers to raise money earlier gmr was to raise money from its proposed hospitality district first there was objection from the ministry and now even if taking security deposits from successful bidders is allowed the sentiment is so low they may not come forward to build hotels now mumbai is facing same situation
5805773 when you fall in love with someone and youre just overdosing off of their love
5805774 human life is too precious and it is too unworthy of man to meet death or become an invalid due to causes that could mostly be avoided
5805775 there is certainly a need for a greater sense of responsibility above all by drivers as accidents are often caused by excessive speed and imprudent conduct

5805780 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5805781 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propegated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy the identification of a stem cell line with o blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
5805782 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
5805783 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
5805784 sen patrick and i have been fighting for appraisal cap reform for quite some time and i think weve come up with an innovative solution that requires a simple majority vote in both the house and the senate
5805785 our obstacle in previous sessions to solving this problem has been the necessity for a super majority in order to pass significant appraisal reform weve figured out a way around that
5805786 rep bohac has been a champion in the texas house for appraisal reform and i look forward to working with him on this critical issue
5805787 the people have demanded a reduction in appraisal caps the legislature has failed to act it is time to give homeowners the long term and permanent property tax relief that they deserve
5805788 this is a very sensible solution to the problem that we have in this state of skyrocketing appraisals
5805789 the bill proposed by rep bohac and sen patrick is a great step forward for taxpayers in texas

5805800 all is not well with the health care management at the gmc
5805801 patients in the meantime are not to get treatment for their ailments at the hospital in rooms with dirty and non functional bathrooms and dirty rooms
5805802 health care pre supposes a clean and an unpolluted environment
5805803 within the area of the building where the pwd had declared the roof of the room to be unsafe and therefore part of the medicine ward which was functioning in the adjoining room had to be evacuated
5805804 gmc is primarily a teaching institute but at present it is loaded with all types of cases from common cold to complicated ones and resident doctors work really hard to treat the patients this needs to be channelled to improve the situation at gmc
5805805 politicians directly interfere in the functioning of the gmc and the appointment of staff besides a lot of money is spent on unwanted things such as landscaping while basics such as gloves and syringes are missing
5805806 we have also gone through the report of the commissioners of the court and we have taken a number of steps to improve the situation
5805807 sorry state of affairs in government hospitals in the state
5805808 while salary increases have been between 14 15 since 2004 a slightly lowered projection is not a sign of worry this is a good time for organisations to consolidate their hr strategies towards a high performance orientation and also look at removing redundancies
5805809 the job market has slowed down considerably across sectors and the irrational salary offers being given to hire talent in the past will now be restricted to a much smaller population

5805935 the preservation of a free sistem is so difficult precisely because it requires a constant rejection of measures which appear to be required to secure particular results on no stronger grounds than knowing what will be the costs of not observing the rule in the particular instance a successful defence of freedom must therefore be dogmatic and make no concessions to expediency even where it is not possible to show that besides the know beneficial effects some particular harmful result would also follow beneficial effects some particular harmfull result would also follow from its infringement freedom will prevail only if it is accepted as a general principle whose aplication to particular instances requires no justification it is thus a misunderstanding to blame classical liberalism for having been too doctrinaire its defect was not that it adhered too stubbornly to principles but rather that it lacked principles sufficiently definite to provide clear guidance and that it often appeared simplys to accept the traditional functions of goverment and to oppose all new ones consistency is possible only if definite principles are accepted but the concept of liberty with which the liberals of the nineteenth century operated was in many respects so vague that it did not provide clear guidance

5805961 two weeks before i came here i had an operation for a tumour
5805962 i could only ride in walk when i arrived in hong kong and lancet was brilliant usually hes difficult when you are getting on and off him but he seemed to know i wasnt well and he just stood there for me for a change
5805963 i had lots of help with my horse people kept saying we believe in you you can do it but it took a huge effort from the team and a lot of physiotherapy and work in the gym to get me going again
5805964 everyone was so positive and so kind im really proud of my horse and proud of my friends when you are sick you find out who your real friends are and many of my rivals turned into my best friends
5805965 she rode lancet every day she lives four hours away from me and shes a really good friend
5805966 the music was all over me and i was too hectic
5805967 he doesnt want to be a police horse again he knows that a dressage life is better and more interesting and he likes to work to music and he likes to do it well
5805968 i hadnt forgotten what happened the other day but if i wanted to win i had to take the risk
5805969 my horse is outstanding and my feelings for him dont change because of the mistakes he made i just have to work to get his confidence back again
5805970 i really like to ride to music and after i heard isabells score i knew i needed to do a good test but without risks it went well except for the last halt today it just didnt happen but i thought lets forget about it it doesnt matter
5805971 i like hong kong and i like the people here but the pressure on me was huge
5805972 in athens i had nothing to lose so i was more relaxed but this time i felt i have to have the gold medal to keep up the standard and in the grand prix salinero was tense
5805973 in the special i tried more and then isabell had her mistake but today i was more relaxed i decided to do as good as i can and i tried to stay calm during the warm up i decided that if i didnt feel safe in the ring i wouldnt do the changes on a curve but here i am now i have won a third gold medal and i am the most spoiled person in the world because i have had two wonderful wonderful horses
5805974 my horse did a super job over the three tests and today he was very fluent i had a good connection to his mouth his noseline was correct and we were working together i was very pleased
5805975 we have been nearly too good for the last three years and it is a bit of a shame that this has happened at the olympic games i was hoping it wouldnt happen here but we have team gold and it was very close between anky and me i really lost it in the special

5805981 my first thoughts a few weeks ago were that maybe id work to get healthy and shoot to try and make the wbc team but i just dont think thats in the cards
5805982 thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things i expected too the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5806048 the finnish steamship company agent met us already in hyvinge which was good because as we stepped off the train in hang we were 350 exhausted emigrants milling aimlessly about
5806049 traveling on board the bigger hull ships is always a special treat polaris and arcturus are the best ships of the baltic sea and both provide a taste of atlantic cruising when selected for transportation one detail seems unpleasant to me on our finnish ships it is customary that second class passengers are provided the same right as the first class passengers to walk the entire decks for exercise and to enjoy the first class food on the polaris segregation system has been implemented mirroring the customs on the ocean liners as soon as the polaris leaves hang all kinds of gates are applied on the decks and locked with sturdy pad locks the tiny space on the aft deck and port side walkway is reserved for the second class passengers who have to share the space with russian emigrants the special menu provided in the aft dining room also has a character of second class by telling this my purpose is not to blame the company it is entitled to reduce the degree in comfort in proportion to the reduced fare i mention it encouraging passengers who like myself normally are content with a second class bunk bed during sea voyages to select first class accommodation on the copenhagen ships for the added comfort and good food emigrant life on board provides entertainment although it is depressing to see these able men and women leave their finnish turf but they are in a merry mode laugh play and dance already the first night as the august night descended on the baltic sea and the silhouettes of passengers became obscure the sound of a violin could be heard and in a minute one could see couples bouncing around on the narrow tarred parquet between rope coils and boxes this was down on the poop deck up on the aft deck the same music provided for the ring dances applied in a triangle though the violin was recessed and the viola filled in with hilariously falsified upper class melodies on the aft hold cover the russians were seated in close rows busy with small talk while the tea from the samovar was passed around and the boy who was dispatched to bring more each time secretly sucked the premier brew through the kettle spout emigrant ball on the polaris from edvin hjelts stereographic photo collection the second day yes alas the second day a brisk southwesterly wind shredded the white wave tips and made the polaris behave like a rocking horse the daughters of finland were lining the railings standing on their toes spitting those who were unaffected walked hence and forth slapping their backs while laughing and humming the polka tunes of last night soon the spindrift covered the fore ship and the emigrants were crowding the on the aft deck for cover the upper class passengers passed ice cubes lemon wedges and stiffeners approximately three showed up at the supper table one had herring one enjoyed a piece of dark rye bread and one sat staring out in space i imagine the honored reader has experienced this kind of entertainment if not it is worthwhile to give it a try in particular staring is a thrilling stage
5806050 the prominent person in the church has no scripture for such an action her difficulty is already extremely hard on her and he would make it even worse this would be cruel treatment and something the lord would not do i recommend someone discipline the prominent member
5806051 i would allow the girl to teach as long as she only wore the pants required at school and dresses or skirts the rest of the time and i would discipline the pharisee that wants her disciplined for being a cruel callused graceless boor
5806052 the grace of god does not break fellowship and throw a teenage girl out of a church for wearing loose fitting pants to a school that she cant afford to go to but chose to because she got a scholarship i believe in standards and i believe in convictions but i dont believe in extremes that do this maybe this church member should go read 1 corinthians 13 and examine how much he cares for others where would any of us be if it werent for gods grace in our lives after we accept christ
5806053 i would say from what you told me that the girl wants to do right and the church wants to do right i would certainly not discipline her further it sounds like she has a heart to do right and needs to be encouraged not further discouraged
5806054 the standards for workers and decision to remove a person from a place of ministry sounds right and just but 1 corinthians 5 is dealing with fornication id have to educate that prominent person if that prominent person does not receive instruction but pushes the issue prov 30 33 then he would be sowing discord and find grounds to have himself separated
5806055 from what i understand from the information you listed i think church discipline is a bit extreme in this matter if the church standards are such that a teacher cannot wear pants at any time then that is their standard i have standards in our church for staff and workers also and i think it is prudent to do so if she violates that standard then i guess they can go ahead and not let her teach as far as not taking the lords table i think that is too far in this instance it doesnt sound as though this young lady is rebellious or stubborn the church contacted the school and they have their dress standards also i also assume this may be the only opportunity this young lady has at the present time to go to school because of her family and financial situation it seems clear that most if not all of this is not under her control the only choices she seems to have is to follow the schools standards of dress or not to attend the school is that the choice the young lady must face that seems to be the root of the matter to me a time in serious prayer by the pastor seeking the lords will is the best solution pastors have to make tough decisions but once bathed in prayer and led by the lord those decisions are better made it is easy to sit on the sideline and coach this one it isnt in my church but in summary i believe church discipline is not proper in this case
5806056 1 corinthians 11 24 34 teaches that a person is to examine themselves before partaking of the lords supper this is a self examination as a pastor of a church all we can do at this point is teach the proper way to observe the lords supper and that individual has to examine his her self to see if they are partaking of it worthily this has nothing to do with dress but our reflection and remembrance of the suffering of christ with the information provided below i see nothing that should keep this lady from teaching her sunday school class as long as she is modestly dressed spiritually minded faithful and prepared to teach neither do i see anything here that should warrant discipline from the church i would encourage the prominent individual to study the mentioned scriptures and pray for understanding
5806057 obviously the word of god is the final authority lets talk consistency and favoritism every person should then be held to the same form of discipline this is extremely hard to do since sin is sin and in gods eyes one sin is not greater than another this form of discipline could be administered evenly across the board what if the tithing records were made public failing to tithe is sin could it be reason to forbid participation in the lords supper
5806058 nowhere in scripture we will find that our lord will have us sin in order to conform to the worlds rules it is not our lords will for us to attend any school that demands of us to follow unscriptural beliefs almighty god has a perfect plan for this young lady and for each and every one of us
5806059 seems to me that standards for workers is a different thing than standards for attendees i would advise the girl to graciously submit to no longer being qualified to teach in the church and to go ahead and attend the school as she continues to grow in the lord she will develop her own convictions based upon her understanding of scripture concerning the prominent person in the church is his name diotrephes perhaps he should be disciplined because of his insensitivity to the growth rate of babes in the lord if the girl wants to be an attendee rather than a worker that is her business the prominent person in the church is the real problem not the spiritually growing girl who appears to be walking in the light if we offend or anger anyone lets offend and anger the prominent person not the babe in christ
5806060 i can see why the church would not allow her to teach in sunday school since not wearing pants at all is the churches policy or standard i do not however see the gross immorality as 1 corinthians deals with she should be disciplined no further by the church it seems to me that this prominent person in the church is taking it a bit too far especially for a young person who needs to be nurtured also i would consider her unsaved family great care should be observed to go to such an extreme as to turn her out of the church or withdraw fellowship could have a drastic effect on them though i agree with the standard of the church or its pastor wearing loose pants is not on the list of 1 corinthians 5 11 as to not allowing her to partake of the lords supper as i understand the bible the only way anyone can eat or drink worthily is to be saved by the grace of god washed in his precious blood who is worthy to partake of any of gods blessings outside of salvation none of us should be able to partake of the lords supper if sinless perfection is a prerequisite
5806061 this situation is unfortunate but there are a few scriptural considerations here first and i think the over riding concern for individual members is that whatever course of action is followed the members response must be based on love for this girl and a desire to see her become more like christ we know that christ said the mark of true disciples is their love for one another also christ give the 2 greatest commandments both of which center on love i believe it is important to maintain standards of righteousness but failure to do so in a spirit of love fails the test of scripture perhaps some pastoral instruction on the proper attitude towards restoring an errant brother might be in order for the influential member gal 6 1 second i agree with you on the issue of biblical modesty your description of the pants in question seems to indicate that they are relatively modest for pants though i will not dispute they are still pants and not the best choice unfortunately the school will not bend and the decision from this childs perspective is almost impossible our partners on the field have taken an instructive approach dealing with the subject of modesty regularly and allowing time for the holy spirit to convict on these issues they have seen a great deal of success but as new believers enter the fellowship they require the same instruction so he has a number of women in his church plants who wear pants at any given time each of whom require the same instruction as for this particular situation i agree that if she fails to follow the churchs standards for dress she may not hold a teaching position in the church but i find the idea of church discipline to be overkill it may be in time she will grow spiritually to the point that the decision becomes easier but until that time a bit of christian charity while not endorsing her decision will go a long way to helping her grow spiritually
5806062 as to the prominent person in the church who is calling for church discipline such an action could possibly destroy this girls faith not only in the church but in christians as a whole aside from that what kind of a testimony would it send to this girls family whom im sure the church is endeavoring to win to the lord i believe that a bit of grace might be extended here thank god for his amazing grace which he gives to us each and every day i corinthians 13
5806063 if the issue as you described it happened for us the person would be removed from leadership because of failing to meet the leadership standards however putting the person under church discipline seems to be harsh i would sit down with the person and explain that we cannot use them any more in a leadership capacity i would also make sure to explain scripturally why we are taking that position i would also seek to find out why she is choosing to attend a school that will take her out of a leadership position in the lords house at the moment i would think she has done nothing worthy of church discipline although there seems to be a desire to go in a wrong direction spiritually she needs to rethink the schooling situation and encouraged to do so what does god really want for your life to honor and glorify him 1 corinthians 6 19 20 sometimes schooling in a wrong place leads to many other problems i would probably discuss church discipline with the prominent member scripturally and seek to help him understand why this is not a church discipline issue i would let him know we will keep an eye on it and we will monitor the situation and take appropriate action as needed
5806064 if the young girl came home and immediately changed into the proper attire then her heart is right if the school has asked for this dress code for some form of moral issues and or it is freezing cold in the middle of winter and snow is 3 ft deep then the church and this particular member is unfair and unyielding to her plight and no christ like love understanding is being shown to her
5806065 i would not use church discipline we allow people of all kinds of backgrounds and levels of their christian growth to attend lost folks baby believers backslidden believers struggling believers if she insists on leadership then a line must be drawn but i would not discipline because she or her family have not grown enough spiritually to match others convictions while i do not know her or all details you must decide if it is real rebellion or a growth issue
5806066 said prominent person is not exhibiting anything remotely close to the love and wisdom of christ but rather has the spirit of a pharisee the term pharisee gets overused but it is applicable here i hate religious spirits i hate religion i e that of the prominent person when said religion is without the spirit
5806067 i do not agree with the wearing of pants by women unless they are loose enough to not emphasize the body parts that men are attracted to at the same time i have never found the issue of pants wearing to be an issue to which the scriptures speak in regard to her ability to teach sunday school it certainly does not fall into the category of a gross immorality such as 1 corinthians 5 requires to be disciplined churches can hold to convictions about women not wearing pants and i think they would be right but they must show mercy too
5806068 the real thing that matters on all sides is to have the right spiritual attitude and walk in true fellowship with god to put a godly girl out of fellowship because she has to wear s pants is absurd this is legalism to the max how can one equate the evil of 1 corinthians 5 with this girls situation
5806069 as to the matter of the prominent person in the church thinking that the girl should be banned from partaking of the lords supper that is not what the bible teaches the bible does not teach that the church is to police the lords supper the bible teaches that the preacher is to clearly preach the warnings about partaking of the lords supper unworthily and then let god will do the policing 1 corinthians 11 17 34 paul describes a very carnal scene in corinth in regard to partaking of the lords supper divisions heresies selfishness drunkenness etc but not once does he name a name in regard to the problem and tell them to be banned from the lords supper church leaders are never told to police the lords supper that is clearly left to the lord to do the preacher is to warn the whole congregation as to the seriousness of the matter and then it is to be left between the person and god this is where the fear of the lord must be preached and then leave the matter with god the church in question has a case in regard to removing the young lady from teaching a sunday school class but the church has no business saying that the girl cannot partake of the lords supper
5806070 as far as the individual that thinks she should be disciplined after the fashion of 1 corinthians 5 and she should not be allowed to take the lords supper i do not agree with that
5806071 my suggestion is that the man who wants to impose church discipline pay for her schooling at another institution which would not require the wearing of pants
5806072 my question is on what scripture is this prominent person basing that this fits the matter of church discipline as a matter of fact i am curious as to how other churches that practice discipline determine the criteria for such action beyond immorality doctrinal heresy or other blatant disobedience where does it get into secondary issues or preferences i do believe in discipline i am solidly fundamental and conservative kjb etc but this matter of this young lady concerns me that there is a violation of the spirit of gods word in this area we must remember the whole purpose of discipline is not what we do to get rid of those we do not like or who are trouble makers but the goal is reconciliation
5806073 first of all i corinthians 5 is talking about fornicators that were rampant in corinth and had gotten into the church i believe jesus condemned pharisaistic attitudes as im afraid this dear brother has jesus unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her it seems the dear brother has no compassion for her if i run everyone that does not do as i say out of the church i would have to quit preaching and close the doors oh how many souls would be lost because one of christs churches strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel leave her alone and pray for her and thank god for another witness at a college
5806074 this attitude is what has driven many good people away from the church and even from the lord may god help us to realize there are many other problems to face that a young lady being force to wear pants i dare say the man casting the stones at this young lady has issues in his life that someone could judge him for also
5806075 it sounds like someone is making things harder than it needs to be for this young lady unfortunately this type of behavior by mature christians is just what satan loves to instigate in trying to discourage young believers in being dedicated to their faith
5806076 we are faced with this more now than ever we have adopted the avenue of when an individual comes into our church not blasting them or being brutal i have known churches to be this way instead we have tried to get them close to another godly lady who builds a confidence in the persons heart and then we do three things first we instruct as to why ladies need to dress modestly at gods house and not just at gods house but everywhere second we purchase clothes for them if they have not the means to do so concerning the member who is influential and disagrees approach him about purchasing her clothes we have no right to condemn something we ourselves are not trying to correct third we exercise patience to allow god to change peoples hearts how many times i have witnessed this happening in our church and they have become great christians and great members of our congregation
5806077 she should attend the school suitably attired if they remove her from school that is their prerogative by bowing to school rules contrary to biblical rules she is making decisions on how she lives
5806078 can the church help this girl with money to attend a school that will not undermine the standards of the girl or the church sure it will be a sacrifice but this may be what the church ought to do we have tried helping people at times who even had some resources so that we could show in a positive way that we were for them and wanted to help them make the right decision it sounds like this is a good girl who wants to do right we ought to do all we can to help her i believe there are options available to help and church discipline which we practice and believe in is too stringent in this case from the details that i have been given
5806079 if the church has made a decision about the matter this other prominent person ought to submit to the leadership and leave it in gods hands this prominent person seems to be in the wrong hebrews 13 17 humbly submitted
5806080 i believe that church discipline in this situation is going a little too far i am a strong believer in church discipline but i also believe we had better be careful in our administration of it as for the lords supper that young lady needs to be made aware of the danger of partaking with known sin in her life but i dont believe that the church can stop her from partaking
5806081 i believe 1 corinthians 5 type of discipline is reserved for false doctrine immorality or disorderly behavior in my opinion although i do not believe a woman ought to wear pants the wearing of pants does not fit into either of those categories the dismissal from the ss teaching position a matter of christian service standards as set by the local church is sufficient discipline
5806082 church discipline in this matter is way out of bounds
5806083 i would have the following questions for the fellow causing the disturbance is he ready to declare the wearing of pants by a girl to be equivalent to any sin in the list of heinous crimes cataloged in 1 corinthians 5 11 i would ask the gentleman to provide a complete list of his convictions that would cause the censure of i corinthians 5 movie theater attendance card playing hair shorter than shoulder length on a lady or touching a mans ears or collar how about computer solitaire use of nyquil while we all hold our own convictions and standards and all draw the line somewhere on each of these with some room for disagreement on exactly where that line is the lines drawn in scripture are plain and clear and obvious to anyone who is honest with the text does the gentleman believe that if every member of his church were to make a list of their convictions that he would be squeaky clean with no violations which convictions would rise to the level of a shunning offense and which would be a matter of christian liberty and who gets to decide that we are wise to stick with what the scripture plainly says when it comes to a matter of church action
5806084 it seems to me that bringing this girl before the church for discipline is overkill at the highest level this young lady has been in christ for three years praise the lord for her growth but when churches start making issues like this akin with blasphemy heresy and immorality i think they have gone way overboard and btw neither my wife nor my daughters wear pants dont misunderstand me i believe the issue of modest apparel is an important one is this good church going to bring every lady in the church that wear pants before the congregation it just seems mighty extreme to me
5806085 i am only an old grandma but here is my reply this is unbelievable keeping her from taking the lords supper sends a terrible message to the rest of her family
5806086 if the church has standards then it is justified to not allow the young lady to teach but to bring her before the church in discipline is really ridiculous i would suspect with my thirty years as pastor of the church i founded that the man wanting to do so needs to look into his own self and allow the holy spirit to make the decision besides this is the pastors decision anyhow
5806087 i would tell the prominent member in the church to mind his own business
5806088 i would be in full agreement that if the church has modest clothing as a requirement for sunday school teachers the young lady has disqualified herself to remain as a teacher she of course should be told in the spirit of love complete with an explanation i would be in total disagreement with the man in the church who wants her disciplined for this issue as i understand the scriptures church discipline is reserved for certain types of issues which bring great reproach on the individual and the church if allowed to continue this is also spelled out in 1 corinthians 5 11 it is this type of attitude that gives our fundamental independent baptist churches a bad name a name for harshness while i strongly agree that church discipline is necessary within the parameters of the scripture the type of issue dealt with here would only create a witch hunt within the church of course i do not know the man in question i would dare say that he may also struggle in some areas of his life as well in the lesser issues not covered in 1 cor 5 11 mercy and prayer is often the answer i am so thankful for the mercy of god in my life as i often fail him and come short of his glory lu 6 36 be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful jas 2 13 for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment wisdom and discernment come from christian growth this young lady has not been saved very long and needs to be commended for the growth she has experienced and encouraged to continue to grow in the lord
5806089 since she does not meet the standard fine dont let her teach but church discipline over that i think is going a bit too far is she being immodest or seductive we do not have a practice of wearing pants in our home but does this mean she is living in sin i am all for separation and standards but this seems to be making mountain out of a mole hill sort of speaking does she need to be delivered unto satan for the destruction of the flesh or according to verse 13 is she really a wicked person because she is wearing trousers i think it is simply going beyond the bounds of scripture
5806090 i feel this teenager girl needs guidance love and understanding not persecution compassion for our brethren should be paramount
5806091 since when do the beliefs of a prominent person usurp the authority of the church i understand about prominent people and puffed up arrogance and their willingness to wield their influence over gods flock but a church is not governed by an oligarchy if she has agreed to standards for workers and now cannot fulfill those then she should not teach in a bible class sunday school but church discipline over pants
5806092 the verse about causing a little one to stumble comes to mind i spent seven years away from the lord because i was judged harshly by people like him when all i wanted was to serve and please the lord
5806093 it is the best example i have heard of transitioning from the ridiculous to the sublime it is the epitome of legalism
5806094 how many of us have sin in our lives let him who is without sin amongst us cast the first stone
5806095 the prominent member of the church should be shown the door not the girl
5806096 since when are a pants on women issue the criteria for partaking in the lords supper no im not in favor of mens clothing on christian women including pants my wife and two girls dont own any pants however all new believers must be taught from the word of god i e the lord that women should maintain themselves as women and not to wear that which pertaineth to a man the new believer must be dealt with in much patience to say the least the lord i believe has no problem molding a teachable christian who is going to lovingly obey the lord in all areas of life
5806097 i think the prominent person in the church should be disciplined and not allowed to take the lords supper for his harsh spirit until he repents and by the way i dont feel pants are modest
5806098 i would also suggest that the prominent person in the church that is seeking to have the young lady excluded from the lords supper restore her by paying her way to school or organizing a joint effort to pay her way through school so that she would not need the scholarship and therefore not be obligated to follow the rule that he finds so offensive
5806099 that she has been barred from teaching sunday school seems sufficient a measure in such a case as this the men need not think they would compromise their zeal by exercising sweet moderation let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand philippians 4 5 w e vines defines the word translated moderation thus equitable fair moderate forbearing not insisting on the letter of the law it expresses that considerateness that looks humanely and reasonably at the facts of a case may the lord give us wisdom james 3 17
5806100 it seems to me that if she is saved then she is saved and she is well and truly in the lords will
5806101 woe to the one who by bitter harshness destroys her faith
5806102 this teenager needs love to help her on her christ walk and to cement a brick into her calling
5806103 in all seriousness this member should be approached by the pastor to back off the pastor has an obligation to tend to the weak in his flock if she is even truly a weak christian she seems to be coming to church for all the right reasons this is not an issue to remove the girl over it doesnt sound like an obtuse girl or a girl in rebellion also it sounds like the prominent member could be a thorn in the pastors side i will be praying for the pastor i cannot believe that paul intended 1 cor 5 to be interpreted and used in the case as you described it she is a fornicator someone ought to follow the prominent man around like a hawk and scrutinize his every move scan his computer drive the man beating this drum as described is probably guilty of one of the sins listed in 1 cor 5 i would spend my time analyzing his life some people will never be happy unless they can execute judgment how about since it is a sensitive serious issue pray and allow the lord to work in the girls heart about the whole thing how about the prominent member exercise faith that god can fix whatever may ail the young girl i realize all cannot be fixed in this manner but i have pastored long enough to realize that some things the lord is better at handling without some folks personal involvement my final vote is to vote out the prominent member
5806104 im all for the girls and women not wearing pants my wife and our girls dont wear pants at all and our church knows our stand but on the other hand im not going to stop them from coming i will let god deal with them i just preach the word as far as the lords supper i think that is taking it too far this is a big delicate concern you dont want to lose her and at the same time we have to keep the standards high
5806105 in my opinion this is a difficult case because we do want to maintain biblical dress standards in a world that is always working against biblical values i think the church discipline already implemented in removing her from her s s class is as strong of an action as should be taken the opinion of the man who wants to keep her from the lords supper is i think unwise amp uncharitable i think this church should stand with the girl as she attends school by lovingly caring to see her grow in grace a spiritual lady in the church should become a very close friend to her that would be very important if there is no sign of rebellion in this girl i would stand with her as she goes through her education experience if there is a rebellious spirit present she may well be lost to the world and her new opportunities for an education obviously standards that are based on the word of god are very important but love grace and mercy are also important to be exercised by those in authority when there is a genuine desire in a young believer to walk pleasing to god may god help this church to be led by the spirit in all aspects of gods word
5806106 shes caught in a battle between standards those of the school and those of the church either way she decides to go it makes things difficult for her if they side with the prominent person simply because of his status theyve blown it because of their failure to heed james 2 1 4 brother cloud says that man is prominent but does not say he is spiritual even a marginal christian could try to force such an issue he does however say that the girls growing in the lord and faithful to the services including prayer meeting it seems theyre at risk of causing her to stagnate in her faith rather than continue growth and being they say that her wearing pants is a part of the school dress code and not her disregard of christian church standards it says nothing of her wearing pants to the services or while teaching sunday school i believe theyve caused more harm than good that prominent member used 1 corinthians 5 as his justification for seeing her disciplined yet in that chapter paul writes of sins of rebellion verse 13 tells us but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person i hardly see her as wicked when the writer notes the schools standards are loose pants its my belief hes noting pants that may be baggy not those that are form fitting taking away from her modesty nor am i led to believe that theyre low showing anything they should not surely we must be of good testimony among those that are unsaved to have them see christ in us likewise also show that same testimony among the saved lest we cause someone to stumble but to force her to wear something not beyond the pale of decent clothing while not in a church setting seems at best dictatorial not something that would be helpful to the young lady nor to the other members of the church
5806107 it is a classic example of straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel the prominent person sounds like diotrephes of iii john 9 amp 10
5806108 it seems to me that the brother who would enact further discipline is the kind who would bring the worlds accusatory of self righteous christian upon all our heads
5806109 there were prominent people in christs time called pharisees whom christ dealt harshly with because their heart was not right outwardly they looked the part but inwardly they were full of dead bones matt 23 discipline done right with a heart of love seeks to draw back a person not to destroy or run off from our membership or flock in dealing with this problem try to mimic christ and how he worked with patience john 8 3 11 not the attitude of pharisees
5806110 sounds like diothrepes to me church discipline is surely not for these infractions of dress what does the pharisees wife or daughters wear when not at church thanks for listening to my rant ive been preaching for almost 40 years and these things surely gripe me
5806111 i would almost say that the prominent person if not careful could be brought up for church discipline for causing discord among the brethren
5806112 if the man is the only dissenting voice in the assembly this needs to be pointed out to him as well along with scripture that speaks of the danger of schismatic and divisive persons within the body maybe he is the one that needs to be disciplined finally maybe someone can suggest that this prominent man undertake to finance the destitute young ladys secondary education in its entirety at another institution more to his preference

5806121 che sia accaduto con loro non rende la cosa pi amara stata solo una sfida tra grandi squadre
5806122 una sconfitta che fa male largentina ha meritato di vincere
5806123 fa male sapere che non potremo lottare per la medaglia doro siamo venuti qui per vincere il titolo e non ci riusciremo
5806124 il fatto di aver perso contro largentina non rende la cosa ancora pi amara so bene quale rivalit ci sia tra brasile e argentina anche se non lho vissuta in maniera profonda sinora in questo caso penso che si sia trattato di un match tra due grandi squadre ha vinto chi ha giocato meglio
5806125 avrei voluto chiedergli per quale motivo abbracciava cos tanto leo messi alla fine della partita
5806126 in una partita chi segna il primo gol acquista un vantaggio oggi largentina ha giocato benissimo noi eravamo venuti qui per una medaglia ma dobbiamo accettare la sconfitta

5806128 i miei piani non cambiano ribadisce ci saranno altri dubbi sulle mie capacit e finir sotto maggiore pressione se perder la prossima partita mentre se si vince si evitano alcuni problemi ma questo lo sport alle volte si vince altre si perde la cosa pi importante metterci il cuore noi continueremo a lavorare duramente speravamo di portare a casa loro ma questa sconfitta non intaccher i miei piani e la mia fiducia

5806134 avevo deciso prima della finale di dare la fascia a terry aveva precisato il c t in quella occasione i rigori non li sbaglia solo chi non li tira tutti i grandi hanno sbagliato da maradona a baggio a baresi terry ha molto coraggio non mi meraviglia che si sia messo a piangere ho pianto anchio in campo una volta la mia ultima partita col milan
5806135 tutti sanno che quella fascia vale il mondo per me il commento del difensore averla meritata nonostante la presenza in squadra di giocatori come rio ferdinand e altri campioni un onore incredibile
5806136 i eked out that last inch to dip him on the line that would have been absolutely devastating to come that close then just miss out i thought i had it with 60 to go then with 20 to go i saw him coming he screamed in despair when he realised he didnt get it
5806137 it really didnt hit me till i started the victory lap and got to the back straight and i really couldnt hold it back any more and broke down in tears
5806138 that you start to believe it yourself i truly did believe it on the start line that it was there for the taking
5806139 this is just absolutely huge for new zealand and for athletics in general
5806140 we have such a rich tradition jack lovelock john walker peter snell three olympic gold medalists and world record holders i was not able to get the gold but with the standard of competition and spread that this sport has reached worldwide now to get a bronze medal to me means just as much
5806141 i feel sometimes like im representing a huge range of track and field fans
5806142 so its just an honour to be able to carry that mantle and reach the medal podium
5806143 i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount

5806223 you must not love anyone or anything in this world more than you love jesus your lord and savior we are not of this world we are heaven bound and wasting affections meant for our wonderful god on one another is not what god intended do you want to make the baby jesus cry with neglect do you want your undeniable worldly lusts for me to cloud your judgments about what love for our creator is
5806224 physical possessions are nothing more than a luxurious distraction from our duty to revere our lord above all else how dare you attempt to tempt with worldly objects with wealth with trinkets to drive me away from my personal relationship with jesus christ i will not stand for it i will not allow my bastard spawn to tempt into sin to leave me coveting addicted to presents and gifts like your mother to cocaine get off this phone line i only talk to people that jesus likes and atheistic darwinist heathen bastard children like yourself are none of jesuss concern
5806225 indoctrinating young and old alike with such progressive and hedonistic notions
5806226 im collecting money to help care for the sick and dying in africa could you be so kind as to help
5806227 will not help them if jesus wants them to die there would be nothing kind about helping them recover when it defies gods plan to do so we need to trust in what god has deigned fit to happen and it is not our place to try to interfere in his design with the corrupt instruments of man if you had come to me asking if i would pray for the little dying african children or asking me to help pay for you to spread the good word to the unwashed heathens whose only chance of ever getting into heaven is solely by noble white american christians to go there and tell them to praise jesus i might have given some money but unfortunately you did not and are just spreading atheism and defying gods will im getting my shotgun
5806228 until god and religion and all its superstitious tenets and irrational legacy are forcibly imposed upon education culture and society human beings will never be free to live in a world in which people sing in unison while going to work where the sun shines 24 hours a day and where rainbows are edible
5806229 the 3d em simulator allows our rf module designers to replace standalone tools such as hfss
5806230 as a result weve more than doubled our design efficiency because we can interactively co simulate the circuit and physical 3d effects without leaving the ads design flow
5806231 on the positive side there is more information and education on 3g among the potential users so they are potentially more ready to subscribe however further delays may not bode well for the industry
5806232 kids dont be fooled by the lie that there is a man who lives in the north pole named santa clause who supposedly brings toys to children across america on december twenty fifth each year that story is not true
5806233 think about it do you want someone trespassing on your property late at night
5806234 do you want a heavy sled filled with toys with all those reindeer pulling it to land on the roof of your house thats what they say santa does but think of the awful noise it would make and the damage it would cause to your slanted roof
5806235 and think of all that awful smelling excrement that the reindeer would leave on your roof
5806236 do you want someone sneaking into your house at night while you are asleep
5806237 if you dont leave your window or door open do you want someone sneaking into your house through your chimney
5806238 but if he could somehow come down your chimney dont you think that he would get his clean white hair beard and red and white suit awfully dirty by all that black soot
5806239 but if the fat old man insists on coming down the chimney dont you think that it might be awfully hot and smoky in there and when he gets to the bottom how is he going to deal with that awfully hot fire by the time santa gets to the bottom someone will have to call an ambulance or the rescue squad right
5806240 but if santa did manage to get by the fire or come out of the woodburning stove dont you think he would track soot all over your mothers carpet
5806241 when santa is ready to leave dont you think he would dread getting back into the fireplace just to wedge himself back up that hot smokey sooty chimney
5806242 but how do you think he would manage to get back on the roof not everyone has a ladder maybe rudolph will throw him a rope
5806243 but even if he managed to get back on the roof to his sled how do you think he manages to get his reindeer and sled to fly can reindeer and sleds fly sleds are made to slide across snow and ice and reindeer were made to walk or run on the ground
5806244 santa has one of the most premative means of transportation and hauling toys and yet he can cause it to fly dont you think nasa and airplane designers would be very interested in santas secret but they are not why because there is truly no santa clause
5806245 and why is santa using a sled and reindeer for transportation anyway when it may not even be snowing outside
5806246 if there is a santa clause why is it that he brings toys to only some kids especially the rich kids
5806247 dont you think it would be a good idea for him to bypass rich children and rather give food clothing and shelter to the less fortunate children of the world if santa is the good ole man that most everyone thinks him to be why hasnt he thought about that himself you know why dont you because there is no santa clause
5806248 so this one time during the christmas season i was doing my christmas shopping and was well along on my list feeling all holly and jolly when suddenly i saw it i felt i felt so violated it was a sign that stood towering above the k mart looming like a jolly roger declaring war against all that we hold near and dear to our hearts in big blood red letters it shrieked out to helpless customers happy holidays a statement so vulgar so cruel so sadistic in its tacit dismissal of the existence of christmas that it is practically smacking jesus in the face everytime that the phrase is uttered i begged the manager to take it down telling him how offensive it was i was on the verge of tears but he would not budge he refused to acknowledge how heartless and destructive his godless banner was refused to see how much pain and anguish he was causing to innocent children who had the misfortune of seeing that horrible phrase and have their entire holiday ruined by the hatred and intolerance behind such a declaration and that is why it was justified homicide your honor
5806249 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor

5806257 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5806258 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post
5806259 how much i hate india and how much i will sacrifice to save muslim brothers in kashmir
5806260 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5806261 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5806262 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5806263 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5806264 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
5806265 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5806266 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5806267 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5806268 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
5806269 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
5806270 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
5806271 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
5806272 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5806273 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5806274 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5806275 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god

5806280 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5806281 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5806282 oh well i understand where you are coming from but i believe in this and also that
5806283 firm decisive leader time will tell if they are a majority
5806284 since the vote in 2002 majority of dem party have been against the war
5806285 i cant put a specific number on that at the moment because work is still going into level design and a lot will be influenced by game balancing and pacing i would say again that we have an incredibly accomplished team at headstrong who really know this hardware so well be pushing it for all its worth we did take a look at some screens of a certain other zombie game that is being ported to wii and the general consensus was that we thought we could certainly do better
5806286 theres a lot of wii fans worried about the decline of decent hardcore games on the system no guys were not making a 30 hour plus rpg here but we are making something you are going to have a complete blast playing we are making it with a nod to one of the greatest arcade series of all time and we hope youll just purely enjoy teaming up with buddies and posting those high scores on the forums with the rest of us itll beat the shit out of grooming a horse

5806292 4chan is a simple sinful image based bulletin board where anyone can post comments and share images
5806293 throughout his campaign barack obama has mocked his critics noting that they just dont get what a novel figure and consistent unifier he has been for his whole life
5806294 for the first time obama has called the reverend jeremiah wrights views
5806295 he used to believe that the u s government manufactured the aids virus and deliberately spread it in the black community and he still believes it
5806296 he thinks america may have conspired to bomb itself on 9 11 and hes never wavered in that conviction
5806297 now and before he thinks that god bless america is better expressed as god damn america
5806298 obama has been hearing such messages for more than two decades
5806299 he said he could no more repudiate wright than he could repudiate his own family this by the way is the speech that many pundits hailed for its originality and brilliance i think it will go down as one of the biggest blunders in american political history
5806300 what has wright said that has finally caused his disciple to end their relationship while wright has been pontificating a lot lately he has not given us any new bombshells but he did suggest that in his beliefs like the one about the u s government and aids obama agrees with him
5806301 so he has to say something different translation what we see with obama is not what we get and wright is in a position to know hes nursed obama intellectually and spiritually over the years
5806302 the more i examine the two the more i think that it is wright who is being consistent and calling it the way he sees it and obama who is hiding the part of himself that once embraced this man and maybe still agrees with many of his beliefs but now finds him a political liability while obama continues to portray himself as mr straight talk at this point he is a candidate enveloped in shadows
5806303 brooks notes that faith is an incredible predictor and cause of happiness
5806304 so why are secular liberals in general so miserable i offer two reasons the first is that liberals are political utopians they consider human nature to be wonderful and they expect freedom to be used wonderfully well so they are always bitterly disappointed when they discover that this is not the case conservatives by contrast have a dimmer view of human nature so their expectations are more modest when things dont turn out half badly conservatives are pleasantly surprised they are happier because it takes less to make them happier
5806305 its not too hard to figure out why religious people are happier belief in god gives people a powerful sense of higher purpose in life it assures people that the universe is in the benign hands of a omnipotent omniscient and compassionate higher power it offers people a code for how to live it gives us a reason to hope in cosmic justice which is better than the imperfect justice of our terrestrial world
5806306 by contrast secular people have little to hope for they are sure that they came from nowhere the chance product of random mutation and natural selection and are going nowhere they know that terrible things happen and they dont believe there is any purpose in this no wonder that secular people have so few children they have much less reason than religious people to believe in the future
5806307 our temperaments are also the consequences of two very different worldviews one producing the wholesome optimism of whats so great about christianity the other the angry bitterness of the god delusion
5806308 as her supporter i refer to her as simply hillary

5806310 so repellent are bill clintons friends to the extent that a sociopathic sex offender with a narcissistic disorder can actually experience friendship in the conventional sense that b hussein obamas association with a raving racist reverend and a former member of the weather underground hasnt caused as much damage as it should

5806314 sarah curran smith a vice president at lehigh coal said bowmans survival is pretty unbelievable
5806315 it was atheist bashing week for me as i did three debates over the past seven days with a new crop of leading atheists
5806316 sinnott armstrong offered a more dignified atheism that he said recognizes the accomplishments of christianity in one revealing moment he event said schools and colleges should teach students that the crimes of christianity like the inquisition and the salem witch trials pale before the crimes of atheist regimes like those of mao stalin and pol pot overall this was an elevated debate one of the more high toned ones ive participated in
5806317 later the atheist students who organized the debate complimented me on my performance and one said that i had made numerous arguments that he had never thought of and that were compelling him to rethink although not abandon his atheism
5806318 i went first and focused on singers extreme views such as his proposal that parents be allowed to kill their children up to the age of 28 days singer also thinks america and the west can learn from non western societies not to mention ancient greece and rome where children were routinely killed at much higher ages oddly enough this champion of infanticide and euthanasia also favors animal rights
5806319 in a sense singer is taking up nietzsches challenge to rid our civilization not only of the christian god but also of christian morality and his homicidal conclusions which many people find horrific are only a working out of his atheist logic
5806320 he is a lucid and gentlemanly debater and he complimented me for eschewing bible citations in favor of reason and logic and history and science in developing my arguments i praised him for having the guts to come to a christian campus and debate me quite a contrast from the invertebrate richard dawkins who seems terrified to take me on even at his native oxford

5806322 it is perhaps the greatest question man has ever asked we know that plankton exist to feed the whales we know that zebra exist to feed the lions we know that insert species here for insert species here what about us what is our purpose
5806323 if there is no god how can our lives have meaning
5806324 because the bible al qur n talmud says so and it is the inerrant word of allah jehovah god etc
5806325 gideon was a man who was willing to do exactly what god wanted him to do regardless of his own judgment as to the plans or results humility faith and obedience were his great elements of character this is the standard that the gideons international is trying to establish in all its members each man to be ready to do gods will at any time at any place and in any way that the holy spirit leads

5806335 we held out a lot of our starters today so we some inconsistency
5806336 but that was no excuse for some of the mistakes that were made we had some bad snaps some offsides penalties some of our upperclassmen weren t there today mentally and we will have to correct that
5806337 we will meet as a staff and gameplan all day on wednesday over the next day we will go over the depth chart and make some personnel decisions
5806338 observational studies have demonstrated that the concentration of total homocysteine in blood is associated with risk of coronary artery disease and stroke
5806339 to evaluate the effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin b12 on mortality and cardiovascular events
5806340 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
5806341 during a median midpoint 38 months of follow up the primary end point was experienced by a total of 422 participants 13 7 percent 219 participants 14 2 percent receiving folic acid vitamin b12 vs 203 13 1 percent not receiving such treatment and 200 participants 13 0 percent receiving vitamin b6 vs 222 14 3 percent not receiving vitamin b6
5806342 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing intensive conventional treatment we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
5806343 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
5806344 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
5806345 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
5806346 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
5806347 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
5806348 community colleges are in a unique position to prepare local workers for careers in high growth industries
5806349 the 125 million awarded today will expand enrollment in education and training programs and provide more workers with the skills they need to succeed
5806350 preparing local residents for careers in growing hometown industries is critical to improving the quality of life of thousands of americans
5806351 these programs will provide participants not only with the skills needed to gain employment but the change to enter into careers that offer opportunities for advancement
5806352 i know what its like to be married to an icon
5806353 given the connection that singer draws between atheism and child murder using the former as his premise to recommend the latter i wonder if our atheist friends are going to rush to embrace this guy as one of their heroes is singer showing us where the road to complete secularism actually leads
5806354 singer argues in favor of infanticide euthanasia and this is not a joke animal rights
5806355 the calf the pig and the much derided chicken come out well ahead of the fetus at any stage of pregnancy while if we make the comparison with a fetus of less than three months a fish would show more signs of consciousness
5806356 characteristics like rationality autonomy and self consciousness make a difference infants lack these characteristics killing them therefore cannot be equated with killing normal human beings
5806357 so while christianity introduced into western civilization the concept of dignity of human life singer explicitly says we have to get rid of this outdated concept he contends that god is dead and we should recognize ourselves as darwinian primates who enjoy no special status compared to the other animals in the animal kingdom after all parents sometimes kill and even devour their offpsring singer argues that the west can learn from the other cultures like the kalahari where children are routinely killed when they are unwanted even when they are several years old
5806358 he doesnt want state sponsored killings rather he wants the decision to kill to be made by you and me instead of government conducted genocide singer favors free market homicide
5806359 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5806360 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
5806361 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
5806362 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 mu m which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult beta globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
5806363 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
5806364 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
5806365 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
5806366 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
5806367 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
5806368 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
5806369 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
5806370 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
5806371 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
5806372 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5806373 developing strategies to improve the prediction and diagnoses of dementia has paramount therapeutic and public health implications
5806374 when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy normative samples to determine cognitive impairment however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5806375 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of incident dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period mean average 3 3 years
5806376 on the basis of the consensus clinical diagnostic procedures 47 participants developed incident dementia of the alzheimer type and 18 participants developed incident vascular dementia during the study 128 individuals died as expected for the age of this cohort of these 18 had developed incident dementia
5806377 in summary within person across neuropsychological test variability was associated with development of dementia independently of performance of the neuropsychological tests this finding needs to be replicated in different populations before it is applied in a clinical setting
5806378 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5806379 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5806380 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5806381 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5806382 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5806383 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5806384 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
5806385 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia
5806386 many older people have a very good ability to regenerate even better than some younger people
5806387 one interesting observation was that the same proteins can be measured in human blood and that a significant increase can be shown to be associated with aging and age related diseases
5806388 they could also be used to test behavioural intervention food supplements and pharmacological therapies to delay the aging processes
5806389 i would start out with literally a few seconds of running you want to hold the child back so the child doesnt sprint but 10 to 20 seconds at a time is fine for beginning and that will allow the muscles the tendons and joints to gradually adapt
5806390 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
5806391 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic
5806392 arsenic exposure and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in us adults
5806393 we are gradually starting to understand how emotions are linked to experiences on a molecular level
5806394 basic knowledge such as the regulation of the eph receptors by rin1 could permit us in the future to improve the poor transmission of signals between the nerve cells or to eliminate damaging links
5806395 oh let me tell you what were doing this year
5806396 in eight months and 15 days we collected over 70 000 signatures right now were the only state in the nation that has michael bloomberg on the ballot for president
5806397 he thinks its kind of neat that libertarian message has crossover appeal obviously theres not much ron has in common with the mayor so its a bit of a publicity stunt but they wouldnt have thought of him as a candidate if his name didnt have some pull
5806398 were not going to take any action to get it off
5806399 as a fan of michael bloombergs news network ron recognizes they have a lot of differences on monetary policy and the size of government
5806400 i would say its paedophilia a murderer may be able to give an explanation for their actions that others can understand or even empathise with i dont think that could be said of a paedophile

5806436 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5806437 is trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5806438 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5806439 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5806440 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5806441 there can be no business as normal under the current circumstances
5806442 this still hasnt happened every day several episodes still occur when our servicemen detain georgian troops
5806443 what exactly is the problem what are the possible ways to address the problem and what are the probable impacts of each
5806444 it was a beautiful model but there were parts of it that didnt add up and those parts directly conflicted with the model published in 2001
5806445 this suggests that the steric occlusion model best explains the available biochemical and structural evidence that has been published
5806446 any evidence positive or negative will help focus our attention toward this goal

5806450 were bringing labor day racing back to the southeast and doing it with a nighttime event its a win win win situation for everybody
5806451 weve been a big part of the championship battle and we believe that moving even deeper into the chase makes talladega even more significant to the championship
5806452 also by moving to the end of october coupled with atlantas new date that separates our two events which is very beneficial for both parties

5806497 you know i didnt believe him i thought he was crazy but i followed him everywhere anyway
5806498 i dont know if it was because it flew in the face of literally everything i was brought up to believe or if it was just too unfathomable for me to understand i guess it was both i mean are you religious at all
5806499 its cool believe me i understand i was never really into organized religion i only went because my parents had always made me go when i was younger and it sort of just became my routine id go there and learn about god and christianity i was more interested in the history aspect of it than the whole believing in it part but my professor he was off the wall about religion there is a part of me that believes in it but he would just take all the stories ive learned about in the bible and retell them in this way and i would just get mad instead of listening i dont even know why i was getting mad because like i just said i didnt wholly believe in these stories but i guess since i knew somebody was believing in it dude i dont know all i know is that apparently there was some truth to what he was saying
5806500 i just hope you guys dont think im crazy as i thought this guy was
5806501 judging the circumstances im willing to believe anything right now and if you think this guy was right about whats happening now id like to have a heads up on whats going to happen next

5806521 what we do very simply is to capture the movement of dancing people and transform it into energy
5806522 one club wants a green roof so maybe well put solar panels up there or grow things put up little windmills who knows
5806523 doing something is better than doing nothing but to earn the label sustainable dance club you have to do more
5806524 everyone is free to open an eco club or dance club the thing was that he was using our concept and we didnt have a second conversation with him
5806525 telling people that they can save the world by flying to an island to party is a green con
5806526 human power is on a totally different scale from solar or wind energy because of the modest amounts produced and the obvious fact that humans cant work out 24 hours per day
5806527 we think that 21 to 35 year olds the group that we focus on are the next decision makers in line

5806551 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5806552 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5806553 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work

5806560 we are here to celebrate this amazing honor in my life
5806561 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5806562 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5806563 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5806564 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5806565 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5806566 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5806567 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5806568 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5806569 well release september 18 when i still dont think the game is totally finished

5806571 the folgers ads proved exactly the same things that the mohave experiment proved they proved that people say nice things to strangers on camera and they proved that you can make people say they like something if you control the conditions in which theyre exposed to it
5806572 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence

5806576 the uncertainty with regard to financials has kept the downward pressure on
5806577 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies

5806582 we were bouncing in our seats to hear all the science that happened

5806586 he wanted to serve this country he wanted to serve in the military

5806589 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
5806590 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even
5806591 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
5806592 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
5806593 it would fit well into the narrative of his not having any politics in the white house
5806594 no more were governing here its an easy natural message for mccain and it implies a one term pledge without actually saying it
5806595 the question is on sept 15 or 25 is he in better shape or not
5806596 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5806597 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
5806598 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
5806599 the drive bys are just hoping for it because they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case
5806600 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty and the drive bys know it
5806601 the question is how to get the message to mccain
5806602 you dont get in mccains face and say dont do it thats a dumb thing to do you have to say something like
5806603 the last time i checked there was still a pro life plan in the platform so he needs to do some research i believe in where his party stands on the issue of life

5806610 we used the term re engineered it was re implemented from standards but on the backend its a very very different beast as best as we can tell without seeing the source to the linden lab server the structure internally is radically different partly due to our desire to keep things usable for non sl style worlds
5806611 the microsoft developer community should get a mention as being the newcomers of note
5806612 they have been contributing code and have set up their own grid

5806623 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5806625 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5806627 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5806628 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5806629 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5806630 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5806631 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5806632 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5806634 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5806635 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5806636 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5806637 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5806638 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5806639 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5806640 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5806641 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5806662 they have a different approach to wine beer and spirits than other generations
5806663 in this generation there is an acceptability of wine as the alcohol of choice and they drink for drinkings sake for pleasure and conviviality less in concert with foods and eating
5806664 they are drinking wine completely different than the previous generation
5806665 they are fearless they are the imac generation they click and try something new if they dont like that they click and try something else
5806666 they just want to try something taste it and if its good post it to a friend they learn from their tribe not the so called wine critics
5806667 we have found that 21 percent of people who drink wine regularly are in that age group
5806668 beverages like coffee have become a vehicle where you can travel the world jamaica columbia brazil its an adventure
5806669 wine is something that has a living soul its about history land geography people its cross cultural when its in the bottle wine changes every day and when you pour it in the glass it will have a personality its so complex wine is always presenting you with a challenge
5806670 just seeing how wine is a natural part of life not forced not pompous just very simple that was very appealing to me
5806671 i would like to see wine integrated into everybodys life it just makes the quality of life better i want people to see it as natural i think its the best complement to sociability which is something i love to do
5806672 its fun you get to taste a lot of wines thats why im here to satisfy my curiosity
5806673 people dont think twice about spending 80 on a kosta browne russian river or a sea smoke santa rita they buy an ungodly amount of pinot noir but not burgundy
5806674 wine has definitely caught on in a serious way with my generation hopefully it will continue to become more of an everyday occasion and lose a bit of the pretense
5806675 i couldnt get this education anywhere else if i cant find an answer to a question in a book i will ask darrell corti he will know
5806676 a lot of young people are making the switch from quantity to quality they are drinking more variety its not just cabernet and chardonnay they are drinking things they havent heard of before or hadnt tried
5806677 right now i am drinking a lot of greek wines which i think are some of the best in the world
5806678 this is the business i want to work in i have a passion for it i have a love for it this is a job where you can learn and experience something new every day i will be here at corti brothers for as long as darrell will have me
5806679 this is a hands on job from start to finish it has given me a whole new perspective on wine
5806680 there are a lot more young people drinking wine in napa at tastings i have met many winemakers sommeliers and wine professionals
5806681 the first thing i tried that got me pumped up was a barolo whoa a light went off in my head i finally understood the difference between good wine and great wine a wine that awakens all your senses

5806692 what drove us to netsuite was both its lower cost and greater feature set
5806693 we needed our crm data integrated with our accounting and erp data providing a complete solution to provide better all around support to our customers netsuite provided more out of the box functionality at a much lower investment on the order of thousands of dollars compared to the great plains microsoft crm combination
5806694 netsuite gives us everything in one system and its web based saving our residential program even more money because we dont need to invest in and maintain a client server architecture like our parent company needed for great plains
5806695 after a little more than two years of using great plains and salesforce com we decided we really needed a completely integrated system to gain better visibility so we switched to netsuite
5806696 the problem with great plains was that it didnt allow the operations group to view vendor and customer related information with netsuites integrated platform both our operations group and accounting group are much more effective and efficient without added costs of great plains licenses on top of salesforce com licenses additionally the ability to access our accounting information along with crm data from anywhere in the country is a huge benefit for our company we fully utilize the netsuite accounting functionality as well as sales force automation and email marketing campaigns on a daily basis
5806697 weve been using it for about six months now and its drastically better than microsoft great plains which was too complex with netsuite we can purchase product create orders for customers and then ship collect money and support those customers and pay our bills we can see more metrics across the business because we dont require integration with other systems
5806698 the best thing about netsuite is its ease of use
5806699 great plains required a lot of time effort and help from external developer and consulting resources that added to the on going cost of maintenance we had to use separate applications with it and it wasnt smooth to pass from one application to another with netsuite everything is integrated and we have real time access across all our core business operations

5806950 previous esg research conducted in 2004 found that more than one third 39 of medium size organizations reported corporate storage requirements of 1 terabyte tb of data or less with just 13 reporting more than 10 tb of data today those figures have reversed just 9 say they have 1 tb of data or less while 42 now report having 10 tb or more this situation is driving strong demand for a number of information management technologies including networked storage digital archiving and data reduction not to mention increased information security

5806988 under advisement of experts from the national museum of the air force and the academy memorial board our leadership has decided to permanently retire the missile
5806989 missiles were never intended to remain exposed to the elements for decades and therefore it is a prudent decision that the academy retire the missile from display

5806995 we have chosen to lock up our resources and stand by to be spectators while these two china and india come in and benefit from things right in our own backyard
5806996 i think that voters have had enough of candidates who promise the world to public employee unions in order to get an endorsement while people working in the private sector especially the self employed struggle to finance not just their own retirements but often times their health coverage as well
5806997 my family has a long history of public service but i think its time to end the fiction that the current benefit packages for public employees particularly those for newly hired firefighters and deputy sheriffs can be sustained forever
5806998 a large percentage of our state county and city budgets already go to pay pensions and benefits for people who no longer work instead of for public services taxpayers expect and deserve that portion is only going to grow in the years ahead
5806999 at some point responsible policymakers will have to address this issue refusing to play the endorsement game with public employee unions is as good a place as any to start
5807000 our federal partners are key to moving our agenda forward in the border region and today we are continuing with that important mission

5807008 launched in july 2008 the amethyst initiative is made up of chancellors and presidents of universities and colleges across the united states these higher education leaders have signed their names to a public statement that the 21 year old drinking age is not working and specifically that it has created a culture of dangerous binge drinking on their campuses the amethyst initiative supports informed and unimpeded debate on the 21 year old drinking age amethyst initiative presidents and chancellors call upon elected officials to weigh all the consequences of current alcohol policies and to invite new ideas on how best to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol use
5807009 raising the drinking age to 21 was passed with the very best of intentions but its had the very worst of outcomes
5807010 just like during national prohibition the law has pushed and forced underage drinking and youthful drinking underground where we have no control over it
5807011 why would we repeal or weaken laws that save lives it doesnt make sense

5807024 honestly we totally did but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
5807025 i remember kiely and i would talk and at the end of the first movie we were just crying

5807048 antes eu pagava cerca de r 100 mensais e esse valor praticamente dobrou ap s a mudan a eu uso internet de banda larga e n o fa o muitas liga es porque passo o dia fora optei por ficar no plano b sico e estou tentando mudar porque acredito que o plano alternativo saia mais barato
5807049 na poca n o dei muita import ncia para fazer minha escolha e fui enquadrado automaticamente no b sico s que hoje tenho a impress o de que eu teria uma conta mais enxuta se optasse pelo alternativo mas para isso preciso da conta detalhada que a operadora me deve h uns tr s meses e n o envia assim fica dif cil mensurar qual o melhor plano
5807050 muitos consumidores s tiveram acesso s regras dos planos b sico e alternativo muito depois que foram implantados como quem n o se manifestou foi automaticamente migrado para o b sico muitos ficaram no preju zo por n o se enquadrarem no perfil deste plano
5807051 mesmo com as informa es muitos consumidores prefeririam ficar no plano b sico at para ver como seria a contagem de minutos em suas contas mas est o come ando a perceber a necessidade de mudar de plano porque est ficando caro
5807052 n o que a conta ficou mais cara que as pessoas n o se manifestaram e ficaram no plano b sico no qual quem fala mais de t s minutos teve um custo exponencialmente mais caro na conta
5807053 teve gente que ficou no plano b sico mesmo n o tendo o perfil porque houve falta de compreens o da diferen a entre os dois pacotes
5807054 as operadoras n o fornecem um detalhamento na conta das liga es a menos que o consumidor pe a e ainda assim existem relatos de que esse servi o n o esta funcionando bem dessa forma imposs vel para o consumidor entender sua conta seus gastos e suas necessidades

5807058 of the remaining prayers research confirms 64 percent fail to make it past the stratosphere because they arent prayed hard enough 94 percent of those with enough momentum are swallowed by a supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy and 43 percent are eaten by birds
5807059 i think that since we now know sen john mccain will be the nominee for the republican party national security will be front and center in this election we all know that and i think its imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander in chief threshold
5807060 i believe that ive done that certainly sen mccain has done that and youll have to ask sen obama with respect to his candidacy
5807061 distinguished man with a great history of service to our country
5807062 both of us will be on that stage having crossed that threshold that is a critical criterion for the next democratic nominee to deal with

5807064 andan desenga adas por la vida y corren el peligro de estancarse en esa actitud
5807065 la propia vida la que te obliga a ponerte las pilas y a madurar
5807066 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5807067 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5807068 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5807069 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5807070 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5807071 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5807072 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5807073 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5807074 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
5807075 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
5807076 it would fit well into the narrative of his not having any politics in the white house
5807077 no more dick morris no more karl rove were governing here its an easy natural message for mccain and it implies a one term pledge without actually saying it
5807078 the question is on sept 15 or 25 is he in better shape or not
5807079 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5807080 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
5807081 ive been needing to get it taken care of for a while
5807082 we knew we had to schedule it right after the davis fight to get it done i got a bunch of little bone fragments taken out of my elbow
5807083 finally be strong in the lord and in his mighty power put on the full armor of god so that you can take your stand against the devils schemes for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms therefore put on the full armor of god so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand

5807097 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5807098 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5807099 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5807100 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5807101 heres the bottom line if you think that this economy is going well if you think george bush has been a good steward of the economy then you should vote for john mccain
5807102 just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics
5807103 they did it to al gore thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign
5807104 senator obama has a long record of voting to increase taxes when you have a soft economy one of the worst things you can do is raise taxes you cant trust him to keep our taxes low and raising taxes when the economy is soft is the fastest way to slow job growth particularly with small businesses and entrepreneurs
5807105 one of the things i am absolutely committed to doing is making sure that my daughters have the exact same opportunities that any boy would have out there

5807119 he was a long time friend of mine a caring compassionate individual with strong convictions who worked hard every day

5807121 honey you were in such good health i wouldnt have done it if youd been sick
5807122 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5807123 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5807124 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5807125 what do you look for in a submission we are looking for comic features that will simultaneously appeal to the editors who buy comics and the readers whose interest the comics must sustain for years to follow we dont have a formula for telling us which comics will do that but we do look for some elements that we believe people respond to

5807133 the nuns at st genevieves literally beat that into my head by the time i was 7 years old
5807134 the nuns at st genevieves literally beat that into my head by the time i was 7 years old
5807135 not only are we waging two illegal and immoral wars in afghanistan and iraq but theyre planning on attacking another country iran and we will not let them do that
5807136 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5807137 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5807138 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5807139 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
5807140 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

5807143 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5807144 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5807145 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5807146 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking

5807154 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5807155 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5807156 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5807157 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5807158 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
5807159 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
5807160 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore

5807165 though human industry in the past 150 years has resorted to brute force rather than elegant design commerce too could become a wellspring of creativity productivity and pleasure think of the thriving marketplaces that have enlivened the worlds great cities the cherished objects and materials that transform shelter into soulful dwelling design can perform and preserve the extravagant gesture in the marketplace in the human community and in the natural world

5807168 this book can help secure americas future as one nation under god
5807169 because i dont believe in god this part doesnt apply to me
5807170 im not sure how the selection policy for that twenty20 match is going to go but its a no brainer that the guys who perform well in the one day series are probably going to be heavily involved in that antigua thing
5807171 weve got five games now against south africa and more importantly everyone will be looking to win this series its very important we put in some good performances given the way the new zealand series finished
5807172 you cant go into a one day series with your eyes on the game thats in six weeks time
5807173 this series is as important a one day series as any that england play in
5807174 its kevs first as captain and everyone wants to make a good impression after the way the new zealand series finished and theres no better way to play one of the best teams in the world than on your own turf
5807175 if we can put in some consistent performances we could provide an upset and that would be a perfect way to set us up for the winter
5807176 if i get 300 grand after tax id just waste it buy a bright pink ferrari or something like that
5807177 whats the point of having it anyway youd only end up getting left by your missus and shell take half anyway
5807178 even effeminate men who have a strong desire to receive penetrative sex are likely to consider their role as husbands and fathers to be more important in their self identification than their homosexual behavior
5807179 was ignored or stigmatized as inferior but never actively persecuted
5807180 it was the homosexual and not homosexual activity that evoked societys scorn
5807181 whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall be liable to a fine
5807182 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5807183 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5807184 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5807185 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5807186 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5807187 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5807188 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5807189 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5807190 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5807191 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5807192 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5807193 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5807194 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5807195 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5807196 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5807197 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5807198 an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
5807199 to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
5807200 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study
5807201 yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
5807202 godly leaders are supposed to protect the sheep from heresy
5807203 not spoon feed deception to them only god knows how far this poison traveled from lakeland to take root elsewhere may god forgive us for allowing his word to be so flippantly contaminated
5807204 anyone who is in services 4 to 6 hours a day 7 days a week for weeks on end is bound to have some type of breakdown
5807205 anyone who covers himself with tattoos while in the ministry raises questions about his stability
5807206 anyone who talks about the angel of the healing revival that ministered to a a allen and william branham must have overlooked the fact that allen and branham both were discredited with moral shortcomings anyone who baptizes people in the name of the father the son and bam is playing lightly with the holy spirit and is bordering on blasphemy
5807207 perhaps some of the problems would have been prevented if men had spoken into bentleys life several months ago
5807208 as good as it is to have an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff to help the injured it is much better to have a fence at the top of the cliff to prevent someone from going over
5807209 there is a dynamic that makes charismatic leader situations sometimes treated differently and it is partly tied to the very term charismatic
5807210 because this person is perceived to have charismatic power or anointing his or her failure in marriage is often easily forgiven and overlooked
5807211 john hagee of cornerstone church in san antonio divorced his wife of 15 years in 1975 and the next year remarried but his ministry and influence only grew in the years after that richard roberts son of oral roberts also divorced his first wife after 11 years of marriage and 10 months later remarried paula white and her husband randy divorced last year it was paula whites second marriage while these divorces have had ramifications for their ministries in every case the ministry only flourished afterwards in most other evangelical traditions the impact of divorce has been more deeply felt by the ministers in question
5807212 we do not know all the details of bentleys marital situation and so we should withhold judgment on that matter
5807213 what is plain is that he is teaching false doctrine and that the claims to his ministrys successes seem pretty spurious
5807214 i spoke with a very influential swiss pentecostal theologian and pastor a few years ago walter hollenweger who had invited branham to zurich to hold meetings in the early 1960s
5807215 he said branham pronounced scores of people to be healed of their ailments but a half year later not a single one of those persons was actually healed and many had died branhams personal charisma had carried him and i suspect something similar is happening with bentley
5807216 eva tr ffade hans p en kontaktsida p internet f r personer med tarmproblem hans menar att han fiser som ett helt regemente
5807217 we had a lot of people who just showed up to be part of the event not to run or walk but simply to show us they cared i think we are creating a fun atmosphere and that will lead to this race continuing to grow we even had several supporters drive in from out of town one who got up at 4 that morning to drive in from baton rouge that really makes us feel great to know people care that much
5807218 vladimir putin is no stalin he is a nationalist determined as ruler of a proud and powerful country to assert his nations primacy in its own sphere just as u s presidents from james monroe to bush have done on our side of the atlantic a resurgent russia is no threat to any vital interests of the united states it is a threat to an american empire that presumes some god given right to plant u s military power in the backyard or on the front porch of mother russia
5807219 i live every day in fear that gorbachev will be replaced by a stalinist type figure
5807220 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
5807221 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5807222 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5807223 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5807224 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5807225 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5807226 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5807227 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5807228 they told me there are going to be resources here
5807229 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5807230 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5807231 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5807232 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5807233 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5807234 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5807235 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5807236 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5807237 i am pleased to endorse my friend bob tuke to be the next u
5807238 but bob is more than a candidate with timely solutions to pressing problems facing our nation and our planet he is also a man of great honor and integrity bob has the life experience that we need to turn our country around as a marine combat veteran in vietnam bob led troops in battle the u s senate would be well served to have his perspective as we finally bring an end to the mismanaged war in iraq these are just a few of the reasons that i am proud to give him my full support and endorsement
5807239 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5807240 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5807241 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5807242 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5807243 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5807244 she was a stray but she worked her way up
5807245 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
5807246 today one of the leading salafist figures in the north dai al islam al shahhal identifies the salafist movement as the true face of islam
5807247 our goal is a call to go back to the basics of islam
5807248 salafist leaders deny categorically that they get funding from hariri insisting that the funds mainly come from sympathetic individuals and associations in the gulf
5807249 at less than three pounds its lightweight and easy to carry with a built in handle the keyboard is approximately 70 percent the size of a normal notebook computer and the footprint is small enough to fit on a childs desk and makes it easy for a student to see over the top of the display and follow what their teacher is doing
5807250 txtbook potentially changes the hardware acquisition environment from hard to soft mandates thereby accelerating the transition from traditional lab computing to individual student use
5807251 we see a proliferation of parent driven one to one computing taking place which we refer to as one to one computing version 2 0 1 1 2 0 which will result in a new phase of wireless implementation and collaborative learning environments
5807252 yet protestants insist that mary did not put jesus first but instead opted to have a family filled with children as if jesus were nothing special
5807253 alan god doesnt change god doesnt move why have you
5807254 alan why do protestants insist that mary had other children when the bible clearly states no such thing

5807257 ich stelle mich gerne der direkten diskussion mit clement ber die energiepolitik
5807258 es gibt andere politiker wie den langj hrigen europa parlamentarier rolf linkohr die das ohne gro es aufheben tun

5807263 weder ich noch meine lebensgef hrtin haben je aktien an mczahn besessen

5807267 its just wonderful that an indian language is being honored in this way
5807268 its so important that american indians learn about their people their language and their culture from their own people rather than just reading about it in a textbook thats written by a non indian
5807269 we know that if children have a strong understanding of concepts in their own language they are better able to understand complex concepts in english
5807270 native americans are running out of time when it comes to learning our respective languages
5807271 whats really interesting about the new mexico development is that it goes beyond financial support
5807272 a state is now saying it believes in native content being meaningful and important to helping students learn
5807273 forty percent of internet use is on social networks this is no longer a wild frontier and will soon be the primary use of the internet
5807274 until lotame the basics of internet advertising had not changed to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by social media now advertisers can take full advantage of the basic premises of social networks the user sets the content agenda and connects other users to ideas
5807275 many asian brands were grown from copy cat economics using western benchmarks and paradigms most asian brands were driven by a 3 fold strategy copy that make them cheaply and make alot of it eventhough this may be fundamentally sustainable in the coming 20 to 30 years asian brands must transition from being centres of imitation to centres of creation to succeed otherwise there will be little economic sustainability in the long run

5807281 dave winer used the bearhug to wrap his arms around netscapes version of rss and not let go until a merged rss was born
5807282 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5807283 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5807284 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5807285 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale

5807287 when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house
5807288 she hasnt been through all the stuff we went through to get here this is the end and this should be the fun times we all got the speech from rex that he wants to be here in the final with his girlfriend
5807289 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish i think she likes everyone running about after her
5807290 rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual
5807291 maybe its we just clash things doesnt ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick

5807296 the biggest challenge facing a young journalist in todays media is
5807297 gr ce son dynamisme la chine va devenir une classe dactifs part enti re
5807298 can i confirm i was not aware of the emails content or style before being circulated and i have informed the sender that i dont appreciate
5807299 i am absolutely shocked that these smear merchants acting on mr oakeshotts behalf would pursue such a dirty campaign
5807300 apart from anything else the letters to the editor section should reflect genuine local concerns
5807301 it should not be a forum for campaign messages scripted by surrogates of mr oakeshott
5807302 this negative us style gutter politics has no place in australia
5807303 it doesnt in any way purport to be an oakeshott series of statements
5807304 it says the contents that follow are from the community and everything from that email is on the public record including in the public inquiry final report
5807305 people who want to read the truth rather than spin should look at that report
5807306 a brief has gone to nsw health detailing the need for the increases in the department based on best practice
5807307 this proposal is now being evaluated and prioritised within the context of statewide health facility enhancement
5807308 express extreme frustration at the north coast area health service delays in finalising long overdue renovations to the emergency department at port macquarie base hospital
5807309 its basically to raise awareness in the community that we are concerned as much as they are about the lay out of their emergency department
5807310 the nearest weve ever come to that would be when the act and northern territory didnt have direct representation prior to 1975
5807311 there have been occasions where a state member has resigned to run for a federal seat but it would never have coincided with the absence of a local government
5807312 part of the plot as it said in the script was that this event would be used to start an international war on terror
5807313 that advice will probably determine whether we are or are not part of that class action
5807314 if we were to go out to the market today ahead of the time that they were mature and sell them we would incur a loss
5807315 we dont hold any federation cdos which are the really nasty ones
5807316 when the cars are coming from port macquarie and im trying to get out theres not much room
5807317 essentially the roadworks that were announced are already included in our works programs and include funding assistance under the roads to recovery programs we would normally receive
5807318 ran expects a variety of important questions about current issues
5807319 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5807320 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5807321 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5807322 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5807323 if there is no strong voice continuing to pressure both state and federal government to make this happen the project will slip behind
5807324 there is only one way you can do that and that is to vote for rob drew
5807325 if you park your vote with an independent or minor party candidate that will please kevin rudd

5807551 we will almost certainly learn why those two lower shafts were specially constructed to be totally invisible and we will finally gain the long sought key we require to unlock the overall mystery of the cheops pyramid
5807552 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act

5807556 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5807557 we cannot cooperate any more with an organisation which works with criminals
5807558 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5807559 to call this act technical would be a cruel understatement focus sounds like three dream theater discs playing simultaneously if john petrucci had six arms and a four neck guitar okay thats not entirely fair cynic have two guitars there are polyrhythms and time changes shooting about everywhere stabilized by a healthy jazz fusion influence and an obvious understanding on how to blend these clashing styles into a coherent intellectual trip even the musical layman can appreciat e
5807560 well its a sequence from the name of the rose part of the dialogue between bernardo gui and remigion da varagine during the latters trial for heresy a nice exchange and an even nicer black metal tune prefferably to be played between the two key moments of the day brushing your teeth and preparing the first coffee and yes i almost forgot it looks like science confirmed it

5807567 i am extremely proud to have been part of a process that has resulted in such a positive outcome for injured workers and employers in the state of delaware

5807569 the benefits of this project have been quite noticeable this summer at herring point before and after photos clearly reveal its effects before in april 2007 shows almost no beach while the after shot taken this month shows the beach has widened tremendously also an erosive gully on the dune face has been stabilized
5807570 planting grass on the front of the dunes had been pointless for several years due to chronic storm damage
5807571 now the grass should be able to grow and thrive
5807572 herring point is one of those areas where the dunes seem to be attractive for exploration
5807573 im not sure how many people still dont understand that sand dunes are fragile and are harmed by foot traffic but the bottom line is that a lot of people are walking on the dunes and its having a noticeable impact
5807574 and respect your beach applies to more than just the dunes
5807575 it means picking up trash on the beach even if its not yours reducing or eliminating the use of plastic beverage containers being mindful of wildlife and sensitive areas along our coasts and minimizing ones contributions to water pollution
5807576 the delaware chapter of the surfrider foundation is excited to be teaming up with the state to help protect our beaches and we hope that these advisories will help the public enjoy the beaches responsibly
5807577 these signs are meant to stand out from the traditional green signs that say please keep off the dunes and beachgrass hopefully theres an element of peer pressure with the surfriders involvement its not just authority figures like the park rangers who dont want you messing up the place its also the people using the beach or riding the waves

5807696 dear friends there will be a lot of high school graduations this weekend and many of our catholic high schools have already conducted theirs now there is that last summer at home and the preparation for the big move in late august or early september i thought in this letter i would like to talk realistically to our new graduates and soon to be freshmen you have serious responsibilities to yourself and your parents and certainly to christ those of you who are going away will be entering a far different world you will have to make adjustments and compromises with roommates in short you will have to learn to live with people other than members of your own family some of these people may be great but others can be annoying and definitely unpleasant im hoping that you get a roommate who is a decent considerate human being and by the way be that kind of roommate yourself you represent your family and all the values you have been taught in your home that very different world of college has very definite moral problems often enough the atmosphere is poisoned by immorality practically every school considers itself a big drinking school and there is enormous pressure to fit in with an established pattern of drinking that is a considered a part of college life dont any dope can be a drunk in college it takes no ability and is an indication of a lack of moral backbone drunkenness kills and if it doesnt do that immediately it destroys lives through the tragedy of alcoholism you are a follower of jesus christ and not a follower of the world be different you will find others who share your same point of view the sixth commandment which forbids all sexual activity outside of marriage is not suspended by god during the four years of college no matter how lonely you may feel or romantically inclined you may be you are expected to be a living image of christ at all times your parents brought you up with distinct and definite moral values please dont disappoint them happy marriages do not begin with college immorality you have a definite responsibility to go to mass each and every sunday or saturday evening im counting on you to go even if an awful lot of others dont i urge you to participate in the campus ministry program and make yourself known to the chaplain help prepare for mass if you are fortunate enough to have mass on campus try to participate in the ministry programs you should meet some wonderful people there finally you are in college to study do it and oh yes use that cell phone to call mom and dad very very frequently they will be missing you more than youll ever know in jesus and mary monsignor james m mcdonald

5807714 many athletes wanted to speak their mind but couldnt without considerable risk we are delighted that olympic athletes took the opportunity to contact us and downloaded the album it conveys a message of hope and solidarity with the tibetan people and a commitment to freedom of expression that cannot be suppressed
5807715 its connected with certain things that the olympic charter forbids
5807716 the downloading of the album represents an understanding that compassion and nonviolence can overcome intolerance and oppression beautiful ideals to be associated with the olympic spirit
5807717 though you can stop people from speaking out you cant stop them from listening and thinking
5807718 are rallying together to denounce internet retailers that offer songs for tibet for purchase
5807719 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public

5807721 hid much more of his story than any other filmmaker and forced his crew to create drama almost abstractly with symbolic sounds textures and the like which made the audience hyperconscious of sensitive craftsmanship

5807729 a supporting player hit his peak and managed to dry out whatever juicy glamour and heroics were in the film so that it took on a slatelike hardness
5807730 the discrepancies in sturgess films are due largely to the peculiar discontinuities that afflict his sensibility although such affliction is also a general phenomenon in a country where whole eras and cultures in different stages of development exist side by side where history along one route seems to skip over decades only to fly backward over another route and begin again in a still different period
5807731 such criticism is about as relevant as it would e to say that cubists were primarily interested in showing all sides of a bottle at once
5807732 sturges may not be the greatest director of the last two decades in fact it can be argued that a certain thinness in his work his lack of fully formed solid or orthodox moviemakers technique prevents him from being included among the first few he is however the most original movie talent produced in recent years the most complex and puzzling
5807733 agee was a brick wall against pretense in small movies but on big scale work where the boulevard is made of national velvet and the limelights as stunning as the sierra madre agees reviews suggested a busy day at muscle beach flexing words bulging rumps of talent pyramidal displays of filming cuning

5807859 esto puede ser una alternativa para personas diab ticas y gente con sobrepeso
5807860 porque sabemos que no todo el almid n que consumimos en la dieta es digerido
5807861 en m xico tenemos una biodiversidad muy importante de variedades de ma ces que van desde los blancos hasta los pigmentados como rojos azules y negros
5807862 cuando estudiamos estas variedades pigmentadas que se utilizan para hacer tortillas en m xico explica arturo bello notamos que el producto es m s suave con un sabor diferente
5807863 descubrimos que el almid n de las tortillas azules es almid n resistente que no aporta calor as y por lo tanto disminuye el ndice gluc mico
5807864 y el estudio tambi n mostr que el ma z azul tambi n tiene 20 m s prote nas que la variedad blanca

5807866 pero en otros estudios se ha vinculado a las antocianinas con la prevenci n de enfermedades cardiovasculares y hasta del c ncer

5807876 el mensaje est dado ellos conocen cu les son los planteamientos
5807877 si hablamos nicamente de intercambio humanitario no habr ning n arreglo y seguir la violencia entonces lo que se propone es que desde un acuerdo humanitario se recoja toda la problem tica social

5807888 y quisiera rescatar sobre el tema de las plazas que no existe la posibilidad de que sea desechado el proceso legislativo que se est llevando para la iniciativa que present el gobernador para autorizar las plazas
5807889 es decir que el primer error que se est cometiendo es creer que el congreso puede dejar sin estudiar la propuesta que hizo el gobernador tenemos ese asunto en comisiones se est estudiando y tiene que agotarse su an lisis no termina el proceso legislativo de la solicitud de plazas porque el gobernador ya no cambi de opini n eso no sucede

5807901 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5807902 we need to start having a serious discussion with government about what options can be put in place
5807903 hemos mejorado much simo pero las rusas se merecen el oro

5807911 you see when this single company begins to open up its new production facility in late 2009 it will hit the market at precisely the right moment
5807912 moreover the u s government has basically set up the company with a protected u s market by restricting cheaper foreign imports largely from europe that includes a restriction on imports from russia into 2020
5807913 but make no mistake while this company may be aided by the federal government its certainly no start up to the contrary it has an established foothold with its roots going back to the beginnings of the u s nuclear power industry
5807914 in fact just last year this company supplied nearly 1 3 of the worlds enriched uranium supply fueling 150 reactors on 3 continents all this while meeting over 50 of the u s supply
5807915 but as i mentioned earlier that feat was only possible using fuel from old soviet warheads and that program is rapidly coming to an end without the program only 12 of our enriched uranium would come from domestic sources
5807916 that has this particular company working feverishly on a plan to replace those resources before they run out for good one that will help the country rebuild its enrichment capacity before its lost to foreign competition
5807917 now understand this the plant itself has been costly and subject to big cost overruns and without explicit government backing investors have been harder to find
5807918 but with a 2 billion government loan guarantee likely on the way sooner rather than later the news itself will catapult shares of this vital company much higher as investors begin to pour in on the announcement
5807919 this one could be a double as the news crosses the wire
5807920 the stock price is cheap in fact its trading well below both its book value and its cash per share
5807921 but dont expect this key piece of the nuclear infrastructure to be on the bargain rack for long
5807922 fundamentally and technically its forming an investment springboard that will send its share price on a long long run
5807923 the key then is catching it at the right time

5807999 los inmigrantes llegan con su pasi n por el f tbol y los padres se la han transmitido a los ni os los hispanos sabemos que el f tbol es una pasi n es un deporte pero es una pasi n si no la tienes no puedes ir a una farmacia y comprar cinco d lares de pasi n eso tiene que venir con uno
5808000 para la mayor a de ellos el f tbol es el nico deporte que tienen el anglosaj n tiene el baloncesto b isbol y nataci n pero para el 90 por ciento de nuestra gente es el f tbol en verano y en invierno se quedan en sus casas

5808051 esta campa a ha dado resultados muy positivos por ejemplo en lima hemos recibido m s de 300 toneladas de ropa y prendas que las personas naturales instituciones del estado o empresas han otorgado o siguen aportando para ayuda
5808052 se estima que esas condiciones prevalecer n en esas regiones en especial las que est n ubicadas por encima de los 3 000 metros donde el term metro seguir marcando por debajo de los cero grados
5808053 est n comprando armas que no sirven muy pocas est n en reales condiciones de ser utilizadas
5808054 en el marcado negro por esa plata que reciben an nimamente los delincuentes pueden ir a comprar mejores elementos de trabajo entre comillas por eso nos oponemos a esto
5808055 armas viejas o nuevas matan igual sacar un arma de un hogar es evitar riesgos arma vieja o nueva sigue siendo un riesgo
5808056 son gente com n como vos como yo de clase media que ten an un arma en su casa para sentirse m s seguros
5808057 la verdad es que me saqu un peso de encima hace rato que quer a hacer esto el arma la compramos por seguridad pero la verdad es que le tengo terror a las armas por mis chicos pero nunca la hab amos usado
5808058 menos mal que pusieron esta ley me siento liberada adem s me dieron 100 pesos us 30 voy a festejar
5808059 me dieron un cheque pero no vine por eso vine simplemente porque es malo tener armas en la casa tengo hijos tom conciencia y la entregu estoy contento con la decisi n m s aliviado
5808060 estamos hablando de temas importantes para nosotros se trata de la paz es un d a hist rico en total un momento muy nico en donde tenemos un gobierno palestino adecuado preparado a avanzar a ir hacia la paz

5808067 el sector ha estado trabajando con cmos casi 40 a os y hay much sima infraestructura y conocimiento adquirido
5808068 creo que comercialmente el sector continuar con cmos hasta el punto en que no sea posible impulsarlo m s

5808070 nosotras entregamos a la legislatura un petitorio donde exigimos al estado pol ticas p blicas de inclusi n dentro de la sociedad

5808073 hemos suspendido los efectos de la medida dictada por el subsecretario y hemos convocado a esta mesa de consenso para evaluar medidas que avancen en la protecci n del parque
5808074 no descartamos nada quiz s el hecho de que los travestis est n en otro lado pueda ser una de las opciones pero eso surgir del consenso y del di logo
5808075 est n de acuerdo con que los travestis trabajen aqu
5808076 primero que nada para m eso no es un trabajo
5808077 si los sacan de ac se van a ir a otra zona creo que los vecinos tienen derechos y ellos tambi n
5808078 ac hay muchas familias los travestis dejan todo mal todo sucio
5808079 ac todos est n en contra pero bien que a la noche esto se llena de gente que viene y paga
5808080 es un estudio novedoso porque presenta datos con una precisi n que no se conoc a
5808081 pero tambi n confirma datos que se conocen hace tiempo sobre la existencia de sustancias t xicas en el humo de la marihuana similares a los t xicos del humo del tabaco
5808082 se sab a que la marihuana tiene un peque o efecto broncodilatador y por eso es capaz de producir tos cr nica expectoraci n e inflamaci n de la v a a rea
5808083 y ahora este hallazgo confirma con datos concretos lo que se sospechaba previamente sobre los efectos del humo de la marihuana
5808084 un hallazgo que es interesante en el estudio dice el doctor luna es que se encontr que la gente que s lo fumaba marihuana no padec a enfisema pulmonar
5808085 lo cual es uno de los da os que produce el cigarrillo
5808086 el resultado m s importante de este estudio es que el da o causado por un solo cigarrillo de marihuana es similar al que provocan de 2 5 a 5 cigarrillos de tabaco uno tras otro en t rminos de la obstrucci n en el flujo de ox geno
5808087 no debemos olvidar sin embargo se ala el doctor carlos luna que en general el tabaco sigue causando m s da os en el mundo
5808088 porque mucha m s gente fuma tabaco y entre los que fuman marihuana nadie fuma las cantidades que se fuman de tabaco
5808089 en argentina tambi n hemos tenido un patr n de inundaciones en los ltimos a os que hubiera podido pensarse que obedec a a una tendencia motivada por el cambio clim tico
5808090 pero analizando los registros vimos que ya de 1860 a 1930 tuvimos en este pa s el mismo tipo de inundaciones y de actividad de lluvias muy fuertes
5808091 y estas derivaron en id nticas inundaciones a las que hemos vivido en los ltimos 30 a os
5808092 es por eso afirma que pensamos que hay una fuerte incidencia de variabilidad natural en estos cambios en el patr n de lluvias
5808093 en inglaterra se est viendo lo contrario de lo que dicen los modelos clim ticos y en argentina tambi n estamos viendo lo contrario
5808094 lo que los modelos dec an de argentina era que los inviernos iban a ser m s c lidos y sin embargo estamos viviendo uno de los inviernos m s fr os de los ltimos cien a os
5808095 por eso creo que esto se encuadra dentro de las variabilidades naturales
5808096 estos son los patrones anuales como el ni o y la ni a que pueden producir variabilidades muy fuertes en temperatura y lluvia de un a o al otro
5808097 pero hay otros factores en el oc ano como la presi n y temperatura que tienen factores de recurrencia de 20 o 30 a os
5808098 y est tambi n la cinta transportadora que transfiere la salinidad entre los oc anos que tiene un ciclo completo cada 100 a os
5808099 por supuesto dice la investigadora no debemos descuidar la actividad del hombre que est causando contaminaci n y emisiones que producen efectos nocivos en el medio ambiente
5808100 el problema esencial a mi entender entre el mundo musulm n y occidente es que hay un encontronazo de ignorancias
5808101 el islam se representa de una manera falsa en algunos contextos
5808102 esta exposici n trata de mostrar que el islam tiene un legado com n que no tiene que ver con asesinatos y atentados suicidas
5808103 se hizo para imitar los valiosos textos y documentos cristianos bizantinos que estaban impresos en pergamino p rpura
5808104 la m sica era una parte integral de nuestra cultura
5808105 la idea de que la m sica estaba prohibida es una falacia la m sica y el arte de los juegos formaban parte de la vida normal
5808106 la editorial ha ido muy lejos para proteger el contenido del libro
5808107 no niego que hay un problema con las hipotecas de riesgo pero es bastante contenido
5808108 a pesar de una ligera baja en junio la actividad de ejecuciones no muestra se ales de moderarse

5808110 hay que aceptar que el sue o americano no es para todos
5808111 estamos hablando de una dieta pero estamos hablando tambi n de cultura de tradici n de respeto medioambiental y de una producci n que afecta a gran parte de los pa ses europeos
5808112 es un corpus cultural extraordinario constituido de paisajes cultivos y t cnicas de cultivo de elaboraciones espacios y gestos culinarios de sabores y de perfumes de colores calidades y diversidad de tertulias y celebraciones de leyendas y devociones de innovaci n tanto como de tradiciones

5808115 sta es la fiesta m s grande de harry potter en europa as que vale la pena
5808116 con todo el resto de los libros me dec a no es s lo un libro
5808117 durante los ltimos 9 10 a os ha sido una parte tan importante de mi vida
5808118 durante tanto tiempo les he hablado a mis amigos de las teor as sobre harry potter ya no podr hacerlo m s qu har con mi vida
5808119 se ha establecido una obligaci n adicional para las mujeres quienes siguen siendo las responsables del cuidado la salud la educaci n y adem s ahora ya emigran como proveedoras econ micas

5808121 es un fen meno que no puede detenerse los movimientos poblacionales son imparables y es evidente que ni siquiera con una muralla del pacifico al atl ntico entre m xico y estados unidos la migraci n se detendr
5808122 debemos tener m s legales y menos ilegales y para ello se requiere m s colaboraci n entre norte y sur porque los gobiernos de ambos lados deben ayudarse
5808123 la mano funciona con un sistema de control intuitivo que recoge las se ales el ctricas que generan los m sculos del miembro residual del paciente
5808124 el cerebro humano es sumamente sofisticado y se adapta r pidamente a todo tipo de cosas
5808125 es por eso que para el paciente el control de la mano se vuelve muy pronto una funci n totalmente intuitiva
5808126 la pr tesis puede hacer muchas cosas distintas porque tiene cinco d gitos que funcionan individualmente
5808127 asimismo tiene un pulgar que puede moverse en distintos grupos de patrones
5808128 todav a estamos muy lejos de que el paciente pueda tocar el piano con una mano de este tipo

5808380 when patients who have a serious health emergency far from home are exposed to different healthcare systems high spending areas are associated with significantly lower mortality
5808381 i wanted to compare apples to apples and i found that the patients in high spending areas have higher survival rates than the ones in lower spending areas
5808382 typical comparison of a high spending area and a low spending one would represent a 50 difference in healthcare spending intensity such a disparity is associated with a 1 5 percentage point lower mortality rate among heart related emergency patients compared to a mortality of 6
5808383 i found that among local populations going to a teaching hospital was not associated with mortality possibly because these hospitals tend to treat sicker people however among tourists in an emergency situation going to a teaching hospital resulted in lower mortality
5808384 with 47 million uninsured and 25 million underinsured people in america the deepening health care crisis is jeopardizing the enormous progress we have made against life threatening diseases such as cancer
5808385 to win the war on cancer which will kill more than 560 000 people in america this year we must improve access to quality affordable health care throughout the country
5808386 our hospitals and caregivers see first hand the effects that lack of coverage and access have for many people
5808387 we must keep reform at the top of our national priority list
5808388 health care reform is a moral imperative as well as an urgent practical necessity cha and catholic hospitals across the country support a health care system that serves and protects the dignity of everyone
5808389 meaningful health care reform will only happen if it is the top and earliest domestic priority of the next president and congress
5808390 our diverse organizations will work together to help make that happen
5808391 the healthcare situation has reached crisis levels our nations job creators the small business owners and mom and pop stores in our communities are struggling with unsustainable and ever increasing healthcare costs small firms have seen health insurance increases of 129 percent over the last eight years and they are paying more for the same benefits than their larger counterparts by nearly 20 percent

5808403 privacy and technology giving patients control over uses of their health information
5808404 this is a game changing moment where the proponents of an extremely well conceived technology focusing on privacy and controlling access rights to highly confidential health records and a patient population that has an uncommonly high need for these tools come together to solve a problem that has historically been a major impediment to health data exchange
5808405 getting a proper resolution to this complex issue accelerates the translation of research into diagnostics and treatments
5808406 our vision for harmonizing privacy and access through a suite of web based software applications is ideally suited to the needs of those who suffer from chronic illness and genetic diseases

5808408 our approach is to empower individuals to protect the privacy of their personal health information while simultaneously authorizing stakeholders to access to that information to find treatments to diseases quicker
5808409 genetic alliance has been very successful convening diverse stakeholders including disease specific advocacy organizations universities companies government agencies and policy organizations to explore and create novel partnerships to overcome the historical barriers required to reduce medical research costs and speed the process of finding treatments earlier this year we saw this in genetic alliances role in advocating for the genetic information non discrimination act gina which was passed by the us congress and signed into law by the president
5808410 private access is honored to be working with genetic alliance in this transformative initiative our privacy management clinical trials recruitment and records sharing tools complement genetic alliances network to accelerate medical research

5808412 healthcare payers and providers are grappling with the best techniques for treating adhd as knowledge of this disruptive and sometimes debilitating disease spreads unfortunately in most cases current evidence is limited and further studies are needed before these drugs can be unequivocally recommended for use
5808413 unfortunately for sufferers of adhd and their families there are few clear conclusions that can be drawn from the research to date on the best treatment options in the case of stimulant treatment for children clinical studies do demonstrate short term relief but many families have concerns about administering stimulants to children in these cases atomoxetine represents a good option with clinical evidence demonstrating some effectiveness
5808414 i had worked with compliance 360s tools before and in addition to their rich product features i was very pleased with the professionalism of their personnel compliance 360 is well suited to address the specific needs of our individual departments as well as the comprehensive needs of our diverse organization im confident theyll help us achieve our objectives

5808485 tatas plans have to be seen in the context of the normal portfolio programme management that any large company carries out as routine the portfolio doesnt just concern corus
5808486 steel production costs are higher in the uk than they are in india and coruss plant in holland is more efficient than its port talbot one
5808487 tata might want to transfer some of the port talbot assets to holland or india or maybe shut some of them down over a period of time
5808488 the no 4 blast furnace at port talbot is due for relining in the next couple of years
5808489 tata might decide that its cheaper to produce slab in india and ship it out to europe for re rolling from there
5808490 we are always concerned about the future but we feel we have a proven track record that can stand us in good stead
5808491 we have shown over the past couple of years that we can make high quality steel at reasonable prices
5808492 we are a viable plant and the speculation surrounding no 4 blast furnace is unfounded
5808493 we have a project plan to rebuild and that is due to go before the board some time in the near future
5808494 we have a highly skilled dedicated and motivated workforce who know theres a future for us at port talbot
5808495 we have proven to tata what we can do and they value port talbot and know it can be a cost effective plant for the foreseeable future
5808496 yes we know there are pressures and threats but dont knock a workforce which has faced up to those pressures in the past we can do it and we know we can do it we dont see ourselves as a weak link in the operation but as a strength for the future for tata

5808501 loss marks the place where self knowledge and powerful transformation happen if we have the courage to participate fully in the process we numb our pain through denial blaming rationalizations addictions and avoidance we search for spiritual shortcuts around our wounds we demand others take away our pain yet we all face many deaths within our lives the choice is whether these deaths will be terminal crushing our spirit and life or open us up to new possibilities and depths of transformation in christ

5808511 whites in the united states will no longer be a majority of the population by 2042 nearly a decade earlier than previous projections according to us census bureau figures released thursday while 65 percent of the us population is projected to be white in 2010 those numbers will start to decline around the 2030s as white deaths outpace births according to the figures the figures show that in 2042 whites will be outnumbered by americans who call themselves hispanic black asian american indian native hawaiian and pacific islander previous projections said this would happen by 2050 by the mid century mark when the united states is projected to have a population of 439 million people 54 percent of the population will consist of racial minorities researchers pointed out that some sections of the united states already have reached the point where whites are minorities such as the states of california and texas and along with the overall growth the number of mixed race americans was expected to triple reaching 16 million or close to four percent of the population within the conventional definition of race white black asian minority versus non minority this is a big change david waddington chief of the census bureaus population projections branch told the times

5808541 its very frustrating and confusing its hard to imagine how an hoa would try to dictate what type of vehicle you can drive and park in your driveway
5808542 the high end vehicles that are allowed are plush with amenities and covers on the back it doesnt look like a pickup
5808543 the response was its our belief that lincoln markets to a different class of people
5808544 furthermore one board member told my wife that if we dont like it we can move
5808545 if we had a big hummer that could be in the driveway
5808546 the problem for doug is however often the supposed smear turns out to be closer to the truth than expected by the accusers
5808547 we are looking to see if these have got to st ives yet
5808548 ill treat you the way you treat me if you see me as a problem i will be a problem if you treat me as an obstacle i will be an obstacle
5808549 are you saying it is a good thing to be confused
5808550 the world will tell you that success is achieving what you set out to do it will tell you that success is winning that finding recognition and or prosperity are essential ingredients in any success all or some of the above are usually by products of success but they are not success the conventional notion of success is concerned with the outcome of what you do some say that success is is the result of a combination of hard work and luck or determination and talent or being in the right place at the right time while any of these may be determinants of success they are not its essence what the world doesnt tell you because it doesnt know is that you cannot become successful you can only be successful dont let a mad world tell you that success is anything other than a successful present moment and what is that there is a sense of quality in what you do even the most simple action quality implies care and attention which comes with awareness quality requires your presence
5808551 as you long as you are unaware of being you will seek meaning only within the dimension of doing and of future that is to say the dimension of time and whatever meaning or fulfillment you find will dissolve or turn out to have been a deception invariably it will be destroyed by time any meaning we find on that level is true only relatively and temporarily for example if caring for your children gives meaning to your life what happens to that meaning when they dont need you and perhaps dont even listen to you anymore if helping others gives meaning to your life you depend on others being worse off than yourself so that your life can continue to be meaningful and you can feel good about yourself if the desire to excel win or succeed at this or that activity provides you with meaning what if you never win or your winning streak comes to an end one day as it will you would then have to look to your imagination or memories a very unsatisfactory place to bring some bigger meaning into your life making it in whatever field is only meaningful as long as there are thousands or millions of others who dont make it so you need other human beings to fail so that you your life can have meaning i am not saying here that helping others caring for your children or striving for excellence in whatever field are not worthwhile things to do for many people they are an important part of your outer purpose but outer purpose alone is always relative unstable and impermanent this does not mean that you should not be engaged in those activities it means you should connect them to your inner primary purpose so that a deeper meaning flows into what you do
5808552 ultimately god chooses the length and level of intensity he has a unique purpose for each of us knowing how much there is to cleanse out of our inner being and how much he wants to infuse of himself into us for his greater long term purposes our father knows how much we can handle
5808553 i rarely realize how attached i am to something until god removes it when we put our claws into something and we dont want to take them out we are beyond enjoying them we now must have them the wall more than anything else cuts off our attachments to who we think we ought to be or who we falsely think we are layers of our counterfeit self are shed something truer that is christ in and through us slowly emerges
5808554 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5808555 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5808556 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5808557 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5808558 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5808559 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5808560 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5808561 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5808562 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5808563 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5808564 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5808565 if one doesnt win by any close margin it is considered a
5808566 he made mccain look like a world leader of stature wow
5808567 it was a tougher situation for the offense and the defense was able to lay their ears back for a minute for a while the defense was making it pretty uncomfortable for the offense and all of a sudden the offense started tightening it up it got better and better for them
5808568 its going to take a couple of days for that thing to get the inflammation to die down
5808569 he had fresh legs let me tell you that this time of year they show up quickly
5808570 that competition i think helps you focus and get the details and ive seen progress in both of their play ive seen it where it wasnt very good at certain times and ive seen things get better
5808571 im not going to make a lot of statements yet until i really have a feel for it
5808572 but im forming my opinions of things you want it all resolved but you want to make sure you have the right guys out there
5808573 he can catch that football hes smart when hes running his routes and i think hes even better running routes now thats he been with the defense and has an idea of whats going on over there
5808574 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5808575 if post election the us joins the kyoto system its involvement would take away the excuses for inaction from developing countries like china and
5808576 sovereign actions that in itself would be an incredibly good thing
5808577 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers towards linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5808578 the fault is not in our stars but in ourselves
5808579 oh woe is me because i fell for the pressure
5808580 current business practices and corrupt government do deserve the lions share of the blame here
5808581 more than 60 of u s corporations didnt pay any federal taxes for 1996 through 2000 years when the economy boomed and corporate profits soared tuesdays wall street journal reported citing the investigative arm of congress
5808582 you dont have to pay your credit card in full you know just pay a minimum payment
5808583 we will never have money anyway so why should i pinch every penny
5808584 its ok to be in debt everybody has debt all my friends are in debt
5808585 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5808586 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5808587 you represent the soul of this nation we are eternally grateful i give you my deepest respect and admiration
5808588 celebrity forget that i am a soldier who loves his country
5808589 it is about fighting so our children and grandchildren also have something worth fighting for
5808590 the enemy has declared war on us the question is where will we take a stand
5808591 every judge should make a declaration of all his her assets in the form of real estate or investments held by him her or spouses or dependants within a reasonable time of assuming office
5808592 the declarations made by the judges or the cj shall be confidential
5808593 it is one exam i dont ever want to have to take again
5808594 the fault is not in our stars but in ourselves
5808595 oh woe is me because i fell for the pressure
5808596 current business practices and corrupt government do deserve the lions share of the blame here
5808597 more than 60 of u s corporations didnt pay any federal taxes for 1996 through 2000 years when the economy boomed and corporate profits soared tuesdays wall street journal reported citing the investigative arm of congress
5808598 you dont have to pay your credit card in full you know just pay a minimum payment
5808599 we will never have money anyway so why should i pinch every penny
5808600 its ok to be in debt everybody has debt all my friends are in debt
5808601 somos m s y los vamos a derrotar la seguridad p blica es una tarea de estado m s all de diferencias pol ticas partidistas o religiosas m s all de intereses electorales todos debemos de estar comprometidos con quienes reclaman solidez y coordinaci n
5808602 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5808603 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5808604 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5808605 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5808606 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5808607 los resultados de la subasta comprueban que el mercado est comprando los mensajes del banco de m xico en el sentido de que se espera que ya no subir la tasa del fondeo por varios meses
5808608 los plazos diferentes al cete de 28 d as bajaron debido a que ya no se esperan m s alzas en la tasa m nima del fondeo y porque podr a haber menos presiones en la inflaci n local
5808609 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5808610 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5808611 the host club the cambridge te awamutu trotting club did a fantastic job and the harness jewels provided a significant benefit to our region
5808612 any meaningful steps to establish and maintain maori participation in decision making
5808613 this is not really against the council its against the government
5808614 were making the claim under the treaty to make them central government responsible and hold them accountable for the legislation that they have passed
5808615 to simply fabricate a bad relationship and then slap a treaty claim on it its not a good look
5808616 we obviously dont support those views and we have found it difficult to find anything else to discuss
5808617 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5808618 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5808619 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5808620 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5808621 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5808622 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5808623 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5808624 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5808625 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5808626 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5808627 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5808628 the most effective way to ensure that hoosiers will continue to have access to clean affordable energy is to invest in new technologies that use our own resources like coal which is abundant in indiana
5808629 this tax credit will add gasified coal power to other sources of homegrown energy like biodiesel and ethanol that provide good jobs for hoosier workers while protecting americas air and water
5808630 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5808631 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5808632 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5808633 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5808634 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5808635 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5808636 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5808637 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5808638 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5808639 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5808640 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5808641 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5808642 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5808643 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5808644 get it off the air and i really mean it
5808645 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5808646 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5808647 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5808648 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5808649 i am married to the next president of the united states
5808650 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5808651 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5808652 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5808653 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5808654 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5808655 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5808656 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5808657 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5808658 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5808659 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5808660 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5808661 the uab discussion book project promotes civic involvement respectful dialogue about often controversial issues and more knowledgeable participation in a global society
5808662 field notes from a catastrophe man nature and climate change
5808663 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5808664 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5808665 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5808666 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5808667 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5808668 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5808669 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5808670 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5808671 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5808672 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5808673 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5808674 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5808675 ning n problema en espa a tenemos la mejor red 3g del mundo
5808676 siempre explora la posible aplicaci n de nuevas tecnolog as
5808677 para hacer que nuestros destinos aparezcan como un conjunto atractivo para los turistas de asia y europa regiones con condiciones econ micas favorables que hacen el viajar a am rica un proyecto atractivo y accesible
5808678 cuesta mucho la transici n hacia este nuevo modelo que incluye el turismo cultural pero es urgente hacerlo el sol y la playa solos tienden a desgastar a los destinos y la cultura es vital
5808679 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5808680 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5808681 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5808682 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5808683 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5808684 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5808685 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5808686 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5808687 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5808688 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5808689 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5808690 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5808691 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5808692 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5808693 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5808694 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5808695 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5808696 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5808697 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5808698 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5808699 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5808700 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5808701 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5808702 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5808703 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5808704 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5808705 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5808706 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5808707 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5808708 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5808709 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5808710 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5808711 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5808712 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5808713 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5808714 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5808715 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5808716 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5808717 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5808718 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5808719 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5808720 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5808721 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5808722 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5808723 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5808724 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5808725 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5808726 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
5808727 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
5808728 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
5808729 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
5808730 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
5808731 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
5808732 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
5808733 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
5808734 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
5808735 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
5808736 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
5808737 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
5808738 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
5808739 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
5808740 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
5808741 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
5808742 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
5808743 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
5808744 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
5808745 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
5808746 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
5808747 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5808748 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5808749 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5808750 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5808751 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5808752 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5808753 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5808754 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5808755 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5808756 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5808757 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5808758 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5808759 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5808760 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5808761 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5808762 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5808763 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5808764 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5808765 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5808766 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5808767 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5808768 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5808769 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5808770 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5808771 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5808772 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5808773 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5808774 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5808775 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5808776 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5808777 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5808778 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5808779 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5808780 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
5808781 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5808782 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5808783 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5808784 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5808785 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5808786 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5808787 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5808788 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5808789 what do you want your look to say to people
5808790 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5808791 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5808792 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5808793 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5808794 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5808795 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5808796 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5808797 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5808798 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5808799 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5808800 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5808801 investors looking for information must sift through one form at a time and then re keyboard the information a painstaking task
5808802 with idea investors will be able to instantly collate information from thousands of companies and forms and create reports and analysis on the fly in any way they choose

5808806 this will make it possible for investors to tap ideas advanced search capabilities and to use the information from edgar within spreadsheets and analytical software something that was never possible with edgar
5808807 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5808808 we did have a poisonous plant but we removed it yesterday
5808809 it was brought to our attention by a resident peter smith principal went out and walked the grounds to make sure there were no others we acted quickly and removed it from the roots
5808810 its highly toxic and may be fatal if eaten when we had more livestock around the farmers got rid of it because it can poison all classes of livestock basically its a weed pull it out
5808811 it was not overrun at the school as it is in my yard but there was a humongous one taking over the side where the little kids play
5808812 i notified the school they just stood there with their mouths open they removed it immediately right next to the bush is a kitchenette set kids can play with there was a pile of the green berries inside
5808813 these are the kids who would put things in their mouths
5808814 i can see out my bedroom window and it has overcome my bushes
5808815 i dont think people realize how dangerous it is when we pull it up theres a very putrid smell very pungent
5808816 i described it and no one had a clue what it was
5808817 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
5808818 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated

5808820 they have damaged our neighbors septic system and are moving in on us now theyre horrible

5808826 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5808827 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5808828 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5808829 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5808830 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5808831 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5808832 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5808833 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5808834 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5808835 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5808836 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5808837 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5808839 as an organization we are continually exploring new ways in which we can leverage technology to strengthen the ability of our medical and administrative professionals to deliver the highest levels of patient care
5808840 before deciding on a medical forms automation and electronic health record solution we conducted a thorough evaluation and bottomline demonstrated that it possessed the product functionality and expertise that will not only help enhance our own internal processes but strengthen the ways in which we interact with other members of the local healthcare community
5808841 with business needs changing hospitals and health care organizations are looking for solution providers who understand the complexities associated with their forms related processes and are capable of helping them achieve their long term goals for efficiency
5808842 we are excited by the opportunity to work with san joaquin general hospital and believe that through the use of our solution they will be able to help their staff provide safer more informed patient care
5808843 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5808844 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5808845 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5808846 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5808847 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5808848 other than fame for the presenters and mit what good comes out of this research i do not see how the world is a better place with the publicity of defrauding transit systems there is nothing responsible about this i see this as a malicious action
5808849 is it an irresponsible disclosure after the researcher has notified the company in this case mbta but discloses the vulnerability before it is fixed
5808850 what if it takes a long time for the company to fix the vulnerability
5808851 in this particular case it is arguable whether the vulnerability they discovered was critical or not
5808852 how many people would hack the rfid card to get free rides on the t the mbta is probably better off letting them publish the result and work with the researchers to fix the vulnerability rather than pursuing injunction in the court system

5808889 economically the impact has not been felt for more than a year at this point especially in utah
5808890 but i think as this downturn goes on and deepens youll see a downturn in our case
5808891 a down trend like were in isnt going to change dramatically the long term giving that people do
5808892 a lot of the downturn is about people being worried
5808893 but as far as the actual behavior its almost too early to tell
5808894 the majority of our donations come from hundreds of thousands of smaller gifts

5808993 we are at a stage where the theorists do not know which direction to go in the results from our experiment will determine which direction science takes

5808998 the squid is a mollusk an animal closely related to a clam
5808999 but it has an amazingly rich behavioral repertoire its brain is probably as complicated as that of some mammals
5809000 when switched to a copepod diet these animals show no sign of developing the suppression of jetting that is necessary for captures
5809001 the inability of shrimp fed squid to master copepod capture later in life implies that there is a short window of opportunity during the first weeks after birth in which benefit can be derived from trial and error experience
5809002 if the squid does not learn to control its startle escape reflex during that critical period it seems to lose the ability to program its nervous system in a way that allows it to perform the sophisticated hunting skills that are necessary to survive in the wild
5809003 this body of work also strongly supports the idea that a rich sensory environment is important for normal brain development in humans
5809004 the simplicity of the squids giant axon system will be advantageous in identifying the genes and chemicals involved in causing and maintaining these cellular changes even in people

5809063 a lot of the ideas that were in pynchon were hovering around in my head technology and the future and the present true things and science fiction and making them into pictures was almost a way to exorcise these ideas
5809064 pynchon fans tend to take his work seriously i think because beyond the intrinsically interesting subject matter and intriguing stories his books are so rich and complex touching on so many topics
5809065 it will i predict quickly become a focus of the several hundred reader researchers worldwide who read pynchon and write about his works in academic and popular media
5809066 the internet has made it easy for pynchons academic critics and lay readers to find each other and sustain an online discussion thats continued now for over a decade
5809067 i went back and looked again at the first page and everything just sort of snapped into view and i thought this guy is a genius like those who walked the earth in the 19th century

5809071 pynchon was the guy who wrote for my generation so much so i heard people joke at parties that he had a receiver by which he could read others late night falling asleep thoughts
5809072 the reason pynchon is important to me and his fans is he seems a bit ahead of the curve in seeing what is important and what will become the important issues we are faced with
5809073 my sources tell me he is pretty social in his style i think he avoids the media because he sees the media as an arm of the establishment a means of social control that he wont be a party to
5809074 ive stayed away from the cult of personality i dont play in that zone
5809075 his reluctance to speak with the press or have his photograph taken kind of plays into the style of the novels theres a lot of mystery and ambiguity in them and a lot of mystery and ambiguity about the author when you know things about the author you begin to insert those feelings into the books not having any information makes the reading experience a little purer

5809132 pseudomonads have an ancient history and maybe their ice nucleation trick goes back to the archean if so were they the rain makers that led the colonization of the land a question that always arises at this point in speculation is how did it happen surely the bacteria did not decide to make the ice nucleating substance at this point serious minded microbiologists grow anxious and fear the proximate occasion of teleological heresy fortunately we can easily make a plausible model of the evolution of close coupling between a large scale environmental effect and the local activity of microorganisms a model moreover free of any taint of purpose

5809144 here i have a question something about which ive been wondering for a while now becomes a key issue what is the traditional christian or thomist reading of genesis 1 3 in regard to literal physical death ive read somewhere recently from a non christian blog actually that genesis 1 3 seems to posit that mans original state in the garden did not involve an enventual and inevitable death of the physical body i dont see how he came up with that the text seems to indicate otherwise see my next paragraph i wonder which way it actually is according to where this conversation is heading if nature and necessity must be connected to gods design for things it sounds as if aquinas would agree with the non christian man who wrote that hermeneutical blog exploration in that regard in all my years though of living in the chuch and even in academia too and after in which i pursued my education further my whole life so far ive never been directly exposed to this particular discourse in a particularly christian setting in such a way that the various answers given to the question were layed out through various blog dialogues of late last couple years ive become very aware of the issue but that doesnt mean i found any answers in my own speculative adventures ive managed to imagine garden conditions involving both a natural death and a deathless existence in which both could seem to support the gospel the text speaks of a tree of life that man might not eat from it and be stuck forever in his state of sin is why he was removed from the garden this to me implies an original garden condition before man ever did not eat from tree of life of a natural and inevitable death and if the garden involved a natural death then the resurrection gives back more than what was ever originally given in the first place if the conditions of the garden involved a deathless existence however then well reconciliation with the god of the living was in that sense as well as in a purely moral sense a restoration to an original state of union that was lost in sin

5809283 much has been made by senator mccains supporters of his history as a survivor of a viet cong prison camp of the broken bones and psychological onslaughts that he withstood for five long years they argue that such an experience builds character they should also take note of the challenges faced by a black man in america challenges that have built senator obamas character these may be harder to quantify than imprisonment and torture but they are onerous in a different and inescapable way if people make assumptions about you simply on the basis of your appearance all your life assumptions ranging from criminality to sloth to unearned opportunity it can make you bitter and hard and cynical that none of those things is part of the obama character means that he has turned his particular version of the race card into an ace and is using it to play with the full deck that is not a deficit it is an advantage

5809306 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometer out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5809307 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5809308 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5809309 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5809310 looking at its behavior the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5809311 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5809312 the city watchdog tells banks to plan on the assumption economic conditions could be as bad for them as in the early 1990s
5809313 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5809314 will they all be there was this all bologna will i call and the phone is disconnected you know well i get there and my god there they were waiting for me they were two respectful gentlemen one was a cop that was wounded so he is on administrative paid leave right now and the other was an ex corrections officer they made sure that i got in a decent hotel and we talked for about an hour and a half there was a big storm that night and we agreed to meet the next morning then they gave me the creatures dna and they said here we want you to take this and run it through they didnt want to show me the body yet at that point we were pretty much just breaking bread
5809315 it was a euphoric experience for me after 35 years of searching for this thing it just blew me away there i was face to face with this thing it was about 7 feet tall and it weighs over 500 pounds it had five fingers and five toes very much like a human his feet were in excess of 16 inches and his hands from the palm to the middle finger were in excess of 11 inches the teeth were protruding because rigor mortis had set in and the tongue was out its guts were also out of its stomach and it looked like the gasses in the body caused this because they had this thing since june 10 or 12 i dont remember exactly but they had it for about two months they were afraid they didnt know what to think about what they had
5809316 one of them stayed with the body for nine hours while the other one went to go get help and the truck they had to get this thing out by hand and it took a total of four guys a day and a half to do it while they were doing that they were hearing something one of them took video of another creature that was following them and they said they saw three of them in the course of a day and a half

5809334 its been in that pit for 5 years now and the lack of stimulation has sent it mad we cant pass it on to other zoos as they dont want a mad bear and we havent got the money or space to make its enclosure better so itll be here like that until it dies some other animals are showing signs of the same thing
5809335 i am in no way a tree hugger or environmentalist but to say that a polar bear in a cage in california is beautiful is stretching imagination a little too far i see no need to keep animals like these in conditions dreamt up by victorian freak show ringmasters wild animals should be just that out in the wild in the age of the internet on demand tv and books at our fingertips we have no need for these outdated animal prisons
5809336 what has the court got to do with all this

5809346 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5809347 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5809348 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5809349 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5809350 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5809351 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5809352 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5809353 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5809354 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis

5809362 handle and chains stuck to the bunch of knives you have to swing it and hit your back its for sad thing
5809363 the aim of the whole festival is to bring out genuine feelings of bereavement and grief in the participants
5809364 this was not only against their own will but in any event is not allowed by law
5809365 the law is clear it exists in this country to protect the young from harm or from being exposed to harm

5809387 once again the algerian people are victims of indiscriminate and barbaric terrorist attacks
5809388 to give up the armed fight and lay down their weapons
5809389 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit

5809391 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5809392 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5809393 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone
5809394 these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in an unending war that the united states is waging in that country for its own interests
5809395 dozens of people from the shiite community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5809396 we have begun an investigation to see how the attacker approached the mourners and what he looked like we are collecting evidence
5809397 what we are seeing is no change in the pakistan government policies after musharraf

5809440 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race its just a shame that it happened in the biggest race of my life
5809441 about the middle part of the race the hurdles were just coming up very fast and i just told myself what i always tell myself keep things tight thats what i tried to do

5809460 opec member countries facing increased government spending and rising inflation will not be happy to see prices fall far below 100 per barrel
5809461 japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita
5809462 if china used the same amount per capita as parsimonious japan chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year an amount that dwarfs our countrys 7 5 billion barrels
5809463 add that to new demand for oil stemming from india the newest members of the european community an increasingly prosperous brazil and so on for those trying to discern the long term future of oil prices this is considerable food for thought

5809476 he was mad at us because we made him do his own laundry
5809477 he thought he was better than everyone else but he was not self assured he was an insecure young man
5809478 i have a feeling he was looking for somebody to victimize so he could just take the money and run
5809479 live nation benefits from the difficulty of replicating the live experience that casual and passionate fans pay for in good times or bad
5809480 started with control of the venues then used that to spread out into other areas of the music industry and by so doing its competing with the record labels
5809481 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy
5809482 madonna is not getting paid 120 million upfront the money is getting paid out over ten years and thats only if she performs

5809487 an email was sent soon after the blasts in uttar pradesh minutes before the blasts in jaipur an email was sent claiming responsibility that was traced to a cyber caf in ghaziabad us national ken haywood s computer s ip address was traced to the email sent minutes before the gujarat blasts and the ip address of a place near dental college in baroda was traced to an email threat sent to a national television channel
5809488 when it is alleged that he managed to pick the handcuffs and open the prison van door and escape in the vicinity of croal street
5809489 this has nothing to do with us it is the police who was escorting the prisoners
5809490 i am getting more information from reading the newspapers than i am getting from the police or my people
5809491 when it is alleged that he managed to pick the handcuffs and open the prison van door and escaped in the vicinity of croal street
5809492 ayaz is being harassed by the police because he is feroze s brother who was killed in an encounter a couple of months ago by the anti extortion cell ayaz also had some information about the encounter being a fake one
5809493 last weekend when i met ayaz he told me that the police is only asking him about the information he has regarding his brother and they are not asking him anything in relation to simi
5809494 then how did he get the time to start attending jihadi discussions
5809495 we are against the sects in islam and many rituals for feroze s funeral were also not conducted for the same reason
5809496 but usually a market doesnt have a sustainable rally unless there is some news event or some fundamental change that causes the market to reverse course
5809497 there has not been any news exceptionally favorable to the dollar so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word intervention
5809498 the dollar most assuredly is not damned good but it was ready to rally and for fundamentals i might add but data can change and so can sentiment extreme sentiment against the dollar and extreme belief that trichet would not cut fueled this rally
5809499 after the ban i was told by a member of the personal law to leave new delhi
5809500 in 2002 i shifted to mumbai and rented a place in kurla i stayed in mumbai till 2003
5809501 it was then for the first time that firing in the air was taught to the simi members
5809502 nasir a hyderabad resident told me that he had gone to pakistan for some training and could arrange for ak 47s he also told me that he could arrange for bombs
5809503 but i told him that for my project i didn t require bombs
5809504 an email was sent soon after the blasts in uttar pradesh minutes before the blasts in jaipur an email was sent claiming responsibility that was traced to a cyber caf in ghaziabad us national ken haywood s computer s ip address was traced to the email sent minutes before the gujarat blasts and the ip address of a place near dental college in baroda was traced to an email threat sent to a national television channel

5809508 brothers let us drink from the haloed cup of innebriation
5809509 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5809510 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5809511 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5809512 if the recapitalisation talk is realised there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 per cent guaranteed
5809513 your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you
5809514 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5809515 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5809516 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5809517 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5809518 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5809519 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5809520 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5809521 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5809522 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5809523 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5809524 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5809525 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5809526 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5809527 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5809528 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
5809529 when i wake up in the morning i have crud in my eyes and i have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat
5809530 after breaking through some key technical supports in the mid 800s golds pullback deepened as funds continue to liquidate positions and add to the short term negative momentum
5809531 gold continued to drop on the back of comex and speculative selling as the climbed to almost 10 better than the low of its recent 1
5809532 december gold finished down 22 4 at 792 1 12 9 off the high and 8 1 up from the low
5809533 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5809534 the banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
5809535 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
5809536 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others
5809537 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
5809538 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force
5809539 the u s has long been involved in supporting freedom movements throughout this region that have been attempting to replace russian influence with u s corporate control the cia national endowment for democracy and freedom house includes zbigniew brzezinski former cia director james woolsey and obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout central asia that would play ball with our side none of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys it is power bloc politics big money is at stake b oth parties republican and democrat share a bi partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world obamas advisers just like mccains one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in georgia are thick in this stew
5809540 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance
5809541 after the ban i was told by a member of the personal law to leave new delhi
5809542 in 2002 i shifted to mumbai and rented a place in kurla i stayed in mumbai till 2003
5809543 it was then for the first time that firing in the air was taught to the simi members
5809544 nasir a hyderabad resident told me that he had gone to pakistan for some training and could arrange for ak 47s he also told me that he could arrange for bombs
5809545 but i told him that for my project i didn t require bombs
5809546 particularly when taking into consideration that he attempted to escape before such prisoners should be kept in chains
5809547 this has nothing to do with us it is the police who was escorting the prisoners
5809548 ayaz is being harassed by the police because he is feroze s brother who was killed in an encounter a couple of months ago by the anti extortion cell ayaz also had some information about the encounter being a fake one
5809549 last weekend when i met ayaz he told me that the police is only asking him about the information he has regarding his brother and they are not asking him anything in relation to simi
5809550 then how did he get the time to start attending jihadi discussions
5809551 we are against the sects in islam and many rituals for feroze s funeral were also not conducted for the same reason
5809552 sometime between 2001 and 2005 the revered united states constitution passed away the unfortunate death of this noble experiment in self government was blamed on a combination of malfeasance by elected officials and apathy among the uneducated public the new government of the united states a perfected implementation of nazi germanys fascist government promises order and security which were never quite achievable while the constitution was alive
5809553 but by the act of june 11 1878 20 stat chap 180 a permanent form of government for the district was established it provided and that the commissioners therein provided for should be deemed and taken as officers of such corporation
5809554 depends on what the definition of is is and i did not know whether you meant past present or future
5809555 at the revolution the sovereignty devolved on the people and they are truly the sovereigns of the country but they are sovereigns without subjects and have none to govern but themselves the citizens of america are equal as fellow citizens and as joint tenants in the sovereignty sovereignty is the right to govern a nation or state sovereign is the person or persons in whom that resides in europe the sovereignty is generally ascribed to the prince here it rests with the people there the sovereign actually administers the government here never in a single instance our governors are the agents of the people and at most stand in the same relation to their sovereign in which regents in europe stand to their sovereigns their princes have personal powers dignities and preeminences our rulers have none but official nor do they partake in the sovereignty otherwise or in any other capacity than as private citizens
5809556 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in
5809557 the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pending requirements
5809558 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5809559 thanks to the pharm test i now have first person experience with prison shower sex
5809560 i cant do sex but i can give you a stickjob
5809561 thank you for your courage for protecting civilians for standing in the way of those who brought death to the people of south ossetia
5809562 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5809563 they could not do anything bad to the people because there were no people in the town
5809564 the russians have to keep their promises this is a never ending story and there is not a single sign that they will begin the withdrawal as they said they would
5809565 we are here to keep peace between the two sides
5809566 meanwhile they are being well treated and well fed and given medical care
5809567 we are going through one of the most uncertain and difficult periods in the world of finance that weve seen in recent history
5809568 any firm especially one as widespread as carlyle is going to have some stumbles but what is more germane is to judge a firm by its long term record of returns to investors and it seems to me that they have done a darn good job in that category
5809569 with innovation comes the occasional setback however over 20 years product and geographic expansion has served our investors well generating firm wide 26 percent annual net rates of return
5809570 our portfolio is solid and performing on plan we bought strong companies financed them conservatively and are working hard to create additional value
5809571 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5809572 i dont want to be a person like it has been mentioned about i dont want to be deprived of the huge amounts or lessons allah has prepared for the believers in the hereafter
5809573 big target and taking it out like a military base in the uk
5809574 from reading this article his only crime was reading up on jihad
5809575 regularly chatted about killing non believers and buying the explosives component acetone
5809576 ran a website selling hunting knives and islamic flags and was the cells computer specialist
5809577 two bags of ball bearings the shrapnel of choice for suicide bombers were found in one of his pockets
5809578 the even sadder truth is that without the acts of the us there wouldnt be any terrorists derek london
5809579 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
5809580 they knew it was a cbrn chemical biological radioactive or nuclear event
5809581 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
5809582 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it we would plan and find the resources to do it
5809583 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
5809584 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around
5809585 but we want to keep everybody safe and its sometimes difficult to simulate that
5809586 we take the sample over to our mobile laboratory and if theyre not able to determine what it is theyll take it over to lawrence livermore
5809587 the scenario was this a terrorist with a backpack full of sodium cyanide a chemical used in gold mines
5809588 howard deans comments on race and gender today are disappointing and wrong
5809589 his efforts to divide americans are an insult to all our nations citizens and have absolutely no place in the national dialogue
5809590 because we believe that faith without works is dead so weve encouraged people to car pool more and organise their days more because its a combination of faith with these other factors
5809591 god is the only one we can turn to at this point
5809592 hey have you heard about this group called prayer at the pump theyre a prayer group that sprang up and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices otherwise known as the bush energy plan
5809593 you know hes got a lot longer track record than that
5809594 hes a legendary entrepreneur and you know one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5809595 its a dog its ok you can get another one relax
5809596 it seems like barack obamas heated answer about the born alive infant protection act is making some headlines out there clearly the conversation over this bill has gotten obama riled up he truly believes the national life to right committee is lying about this controversial infanticide bill which he opposed he is adamant in saying that the bill he opposed in the illinois state senate was not the same as the federal legislation that pro choice senators even voted for
5809597 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5809598 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5809599 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5809600 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5809601 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle
5809602 it seems our party cannot avoid having a free for all
5809603 it has always been my opinion that the michigan delegation would have a full vote at the convention
5809604 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
5809605 democrats in florida and michigan must know they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
5809606 when the opinions of editorial writers and so called consumer groups count for more than the opinions of the people responsible for putting lawmakers in office
5809607 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist and legal thinker at the time
5809608 if they are willing to make sacrifices on our behalf we should be able to make sacrifices on the behalf of the next generation
5809609 there s a pervasive sense i think that this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still don t spend enough time thinking about the least of these
5809610 in these economically challenging times we need to call on people with wisdom and background like meg whitman
5809611 america s greatest moral failing was not devoting itself to causes greater than its self interest after the 9 11 terrorist attacks americans should not have been told go to shopping
5809612 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me and without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas ill never forget that no matter where you are no matter how difficult the circumstances there will always be someone who will pick you up
5809613 it just sounded so fake and so contrived so i did a little research about it
5809614 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope
5809615 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
5809616 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
5809617 on the issue of abortion he didnt hesitate and he went on to say that he would be a pro life president he also said he was a sinner
5809618 it gives mccain a bounce most social conservatives want to know that he has a faith in god but what they are looking for is where that leads him to stand on the issues
5809619 its important to keep in mind that while mccain has had some differences with evangelical leaders in the past he has reached out to them
5809620 he is strongly pro life and so on this signature social issue he is very consistent with evangelical perspectives
5809621 the campaign is starting to look more like 2004 than we expected it to look like the map still favors obama but mccain has made some gains the last six weeks
5809622 una desaceleraci n en el crecimiento de los recursos tributarios en los pr ximos meses profundizar a las se ales negativas que se han advertido en los ltimos meses en el compartimiento de los ingresos fiscales en un contexto de persistente aumento del gasto p blico

5809626 es el premio para alguien que nunca baj los brazos
5809627 el oficialismo busca que los argentinos nos hagamos cargo de una deuda de 900 millones de d lares de un privado este gobierno no hizo nada por evitar la quiebra de aerol neas argentinas tenemos que redise ar una pol tica aerocomercial pro es un partido con una estructura precaria
5809628 el gobierno tuvo responsabilidad por la situaci n en la que se encuentra aerol neas ser oficialista no significa ser c mplice
5809629 problema es que la mayor a se opone al control
5809630 no me gusta lo que veo en toda esta maniobra puede haber delitos
5809631 es un partido nuevo que est construyendo su base de a poco en todo el pa s
5809632 todav a falta mucho por hacer hay temas cr ticos como la carne y la lecher a de mantenerse est s medidas el futuro est completamente arriesgado
5809633 esto es una revoluci n socialista y al que se oponga nos lo llevamos por delante con el comandante hugo ch vez fr as que ese s sabe como se bate el cobre
5809634 tomando el estado las cementeras nosotros como revolucionarios como patriotas sabemos que se va a hacer justicia con los trabajadores y ex trabajadores ahorita vamos a conseguir lo que siempre nos fue negado
5809635 this is a clear indication of our confidence in the quality and value of our cars and trucks
5809636 were pleased to now offer that same level of confidence with every gm certified used vehicle from buick chevrolet gmc and pontiac and every saturn certified pre owned vehicle as we reach the 3 million sales milestone this warranty enhancement adds a real point of differentiation for our program enabling our dealers to offer customers a range of peace of mind assurances that compare favorably with any other manufacturer certified program in the industry gm certified and saturn certified do an outstanding job of bringing in new gm customers and this enhancement will only add to that
5809637 we upped our game and made great strides in quality
5809638 we take care of our customers by standing behind our cars and trucks with a five year 100 000 mile transferable powertrain warranty plus roadside assistance and courtesy transportation we already provide the best coverage in america and now were making that coverage even better
5809639 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
5809640 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job
5809641 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and bond markets rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report
5809642 the biggest problem remains the housing market and its negative impacts on the financial sector
5809643 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
5809644 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
5809645 amanda kokoeva likes to swim and hang out with friends in walnut creek but what she went through just five days ago in south ossetia shocked her and shook the world
5809646 on the 7th we were in a cafe and then all of a sudden we heard a bunch of bombs going off and explosions and we got scared
5809647 amanda was at the end of a month and a half long visit with relatives in south ossetia when a battle broke out between russia and georgia the fighting forced her to spend the night in her uncles basement
5809648 through all this theres explosions everywhere it was really scary because i had never really heard these kinds of sounds in my life so loud and the whole sky would light up all the time
5809649 her uncle survived but thousands of others did not laura says she was thankful the russian troops were there to protect the ossetians
5809650 yes i know you do not want to hear this
5809651 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5809652 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5809653 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5809654 weve signed the first agreement to supply paraguay with all the oil it needs right to the last drop for the development of paraguays people industry and agriculture
5809655 people say dont trust chavez be careful with chavez be careful with evo im not scared of chavez im not scared of evo im not scared of anybody we are going to be true paraguayans and have respectful relations with all countries
5809656 effectively would be wiped out and their preferred shares left bereft of dividends
5809657 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
5809658 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
5809659 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
5809660 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
5809661 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
5809662 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
5809663 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
5809664 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
5809665 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
5809666 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
5809667 fred cant even take a shit unless someone else massages his bowels
5809668 fred and i agree on so many issues it just made sense
5809669 we both know our job is taking care of business and i mean that literally when someone puts a big chunk of change in your pocket they expect some service and fred and i will both deliver i turned on a dime on that off shore drilling nonsense once big oil told their people to get out the checkbooks fred knows the ropes hell he was even a lobbyist for a while so he wrote the checks
5809670 fred is an actor if he has to speak in tongues handle snakes and roll on the floor to get those toothless hillbillies votes hell do it and theyll believe him hell they believed a silver spoon spoiled frat boy like bush was one of their own theyll believe anything
5809671 i dont know anyone out there who would get tired of playing with venus williams
5809672 we were really focused from the first point we really wanted to win
5809673 we feel like weve contributed to our country in a huge way thats really what its all about
5809674 during the olympic games we fought really hard and we want to show this sichuan spirit that we are brave
5809675 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5809676 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5809677 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
5809678 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5809679 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5809680 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5809681 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5809682 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5809683 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5809684 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5809685 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5809686 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5809687 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5809688 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5809689 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5809690 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5809691 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5809692 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5809693 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5809694 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5809695 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5809696 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5809697 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5809698 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her said phelps whose parents separated when he was young
5809699 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time
5809700 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5809701 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5809702 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
5809703 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country
5809704 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5809705 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5809706 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5809707 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5809708 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5809709 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5809710 are we going to get back to the supreme coourt justices
5809711 there is no contest here who had to make a harder choice
5809712 the kind of justices i will recommend will be against abortion
5809713 senator mccain what is the greatest success that america has achieved in iraq
5809714 be yourself is sometimes the worst advice you can give someone
5809715 the great thing in the world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving
5809716 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war insert act is outrageous
5809717 yes im for it and find bad teachers another line of work
5809718 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
5809719 all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent
5809720 are we going to go back to the supreme court
5809721 i know that you are asking about merit pay and i am repeating the word yes to demonstrate my enthusiasm for it and intensity of belief in it along with a cute line at the end to emphasize my faux empathy for teachers who will be hurt by it
5809722 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5809723 wait a minute how did he answer those three questions bang bang bang when i didnt even hear warren ask the damn questions
5809724 you are very wise van helsing for one who has yet to live a single lifetime
5809725 i aimed at the publics heart and by accident i hit it in the stomach
5809726 and i want to talk more about that when we discuss the s c justices well get to that later
5809727 this is what i said if you misunderstood thats your fault
5809728 its no wonder more people call themselves democrats its easy to identify with a party that identifies with you
5809729 sometimes the dumbest thing that gets said makes the point for you
5809730 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
5809731 i aimed at the publics heart and by accident i hit it in the stomach
5809732 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
5809733 the church has done a lot of good things for the community but this is going to leave a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths
5809734 support merit pay for the best teachers and find bad teachers another line of work
5809735 i know how to win wars i know how to win wars
5809736 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5809737 well yes as a prisoner of war for 5 years it was my faith that kept me going
5809738 i will do anything to get elected including things which are dishonest
5809739 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
5809740 1984 was a cautionary tale you dolts not a motivational speech
5809741 this guy is too stupid to even hide the fact that he had the questions in advance
5809742 those are my principles and if you dont like them well i have others
5809743 can we get back to the question of the appointment of supreme court justices
5809744 there is no doubt that the us wants to change the command structure as things have deteriorated in afghanistan
5809745 two to three combat brigades for the surge amounting to 8 000 12 000 troops
5809746 there will be a us general and the forces will be under us command
5809747 prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against senator obamas election
5809748 for years wal mart has been intimidating and harassing its workers who want to form unions now theyve adapted their unionbusting tactics to influence our federal election system
5809749 wal mart seems to be willing to break federal election law in order to stop their employees and all of americas workers from having a fair shot at the american dream
5809750 the attorney general would have had a lot more credibility if he actually prosecuted government officials on occasion
5809751 he said he would not prosecute what is defined as a war crime in the case of torture
5809752 its clear that the standards used to select those judges were not based on the merits and were based on their political alliances and associations
5809753 those are people rendering decisions over the lives of others
5809754 its not fair to call him a sycophant like alberto gonzales but he is a remarkable cynic
5809755 he seems to believe that he has the discretion not just to prosecute but to define what crimes are
5809756 he is treating himself as the sole decision maker in so doing hes making a wonderful argument for re instating the independent counsel act
5809757 it shows that there is no independent basis to protect people like plame
5809758 why do you think they put so many young white women professing their love for obama in what is clearly an anti obama video
5809759 what would possibly be negative about young white women liking sen obama
5809760 had obama run ads calling mccain a senile old adulterer married to a drug addict wed never hear the end of it from mccain and the corporate media
5809761 but mccain continues this sleazy bizarre attack on obama and where is the media why arent they all asking mccain every single day why he lied about never going negative why hes given up on being a maverick why he no longer talks to the media why his campaign days have grown so short why he no longer seems to even be in charge of his own campaign
5809762 hundreds possibly thousands of homeless recruits allegedly offered about 20 and a warm bed to undergo bogus medical treatment
5809763 the defendants are accused of preying on the homeless and exploiting their desperate conditions for personal gain
5809764 i think these folks felt that no one would complain because they were homeless individuals
5809765 but it is important yet again to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies mini hitlers
5809766 it is the product of an abstract over intellectualizing of the world the classic defect of ideologues it is as we have seen the last eight years a dangerous way to behave internationally and it has severely damaged our moral authority in the world i mean after the u s invasion of iraq after abu ghraib after our blithe rubbishing of the geneva accords why should anyone listen to us when we criticize the russians for their aggression in the caucasus
5809767 do you recall the precise details of the sudeten crisis that led to nazi germanys invasion of czechoslovakia of course not because that morally ambiguous dispute is rightly remembered as a minor part of a much bigger drama
5809768 the mood is reminiscent of germany after world war i when germans complained about the shameful versailles diktat imposed on a prostrate germany by the victorious powers and about the corrupt politicians who stabbed the nation in the back
5809769 but georgia a nation of about 4 6 million has had the third largest military presence about 2 000 troops fighting along with u s soldiers and marines in iraq for this reason alone we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
5809770 surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of and perhaps destabilizes all of a friendly democratic nation that we were sponsoring for nato membership a few months ago
5809771 when the civilized world expostulated with russia about georgia in 1924 the soviet regime was still weak in germany hitler was in jail only 16 years later britain stood virtually alone against a nazi soviet axis is it not true today as it was in the 1920s and 30s that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers
5809772 it is in americas interest to exert maximum pressure on russia to withdraw its troops and halt the interference in georgian territory this latest act shows the need for greater resolve in establishing a european security system that can be an effective check on russian power
5809773 whats the difference between this and the annexation of the sudetenland including the paralysis of the so called western world in the face of deliberate systematic military conquest
5809774 the silence of the left is notable since they so often pose as defenders of peace once again it turns out that american military action is judged evil while our enemies can do the same without a word of protest wheres code pink wheres ron paul for that matter
5809775 we just went tearing down this road without thinking about the potential risks including who was going to have access to all of these biological weapons
5809776 nobody is checking to see if people being approved to work with anthrax or other biological agents actually have the scientific skills to work with it
5809777 there is clearly greater access to virulent anthrax strains today simply based on the fact that much more money is being spent on anthrax research and many more papers are being published but it is difficult to say more precisely how the numbers compare to pre 2001 levels
5809778 im sure if someone didnt do anything wrong theyll be released
5809779 we are all under 18 we all have been here for more than a year
5809780 we have juveniles from 14 to 18 theyre ied makers they are dangerous people
5809781 i swear to god some were just walking in the streets or sleeping and they brought us here i swear to god we are all innocent
5809782 and he is the most dangerous we know about him
5809783 five months they wanted to take my father i told them take me instead
5809784 we invite their parents to come and visit with them they actually have movie nights we have looked through every one of these files these juveniles are dangerous
5809785 it just seems to me that john edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
5809786 in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up
5809787 what better prepubescent dream of genital waving dominance over all the women in the world than to blame the intelligence of a woman for her husbands infidelity
5809788 what a pure sentiment to share with the less well recompensed losers who comprise your audience than to dismiss their failures as husbands as men rush on the woman
5809789 i mean even these days three divorces is a lot
5809790 a 38 million salary and the guy cant keep the same woman gotta be the womans fault right
5809791 an endorsement by powell could go a long way to attracting moderates and wayward republicans to the presumptive democratic presidential candidate
5809792 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
5809793 was the person who advertised himself as dan quayles brain
5809794 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
5809795 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
5809796 hes a very busy man he doesnt have time to waste on my musings
5809797 i on the other hand have a lot of time to muse here with you guys and with neil cavuto
5809798 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
5809799 whether it was voting against or voting present on issues related to stricter penalties on offenders of serious crimes or disallowing citizens to exercise their right to self defense obama demonstrated poor judgment on an important issue to his constituents
5809800 john mccain voted to keep cop killer bullets on the street and opposed the bipartisan crime bills of the early 90s that led to the hiring of thousands of police officers and helped communities stay safe a record that he will have to explain
5809801 second amendment protects an individuals right to own a firearm and he also believes as the supreme court recognized that both the federal government and local communities can adopt reasonable safety measures
5809802 i know of no time when he spoke out against the chicago gun ban
5809803 if you can ratchet back the firepower then you really can do something about the level of violence in urban areas
5809804 the best thing the senate could do is give out more money for more cops
5809805 john mccain voted against these fiscally reckless proposals because americans should expect that their government can fund law enforcement priorities by eliminating the billions in wasteful spending that occurs every year not by further increasing the tax burden on american families
5809806 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5809807 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses

5809821 the charge sheet will be presented in parliament by tuesday
5809822 time has come when the nation will decide its own destiny as the people voted for a change in the country in the february elections
5809823 whether he quits or counters the impeachment move will be decided after he sees the charges
5809824 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
5809825 it will consider opening portions of the offshore outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5809826 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
5809827 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5809828 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5809829 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5809830 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority

5809891 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5809892 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5809893 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5809894 hes actually returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex starved men that will pounce upon the first girl they see
5809895 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything

5809898 i reeled it in and when i reached down to grab the hook i saw all of those teeth sticking out of its mouth and i thought what the heck is this thing
5809899 it is tough to tell without having a good shot of the mouth and teeth but the rest of the fish reminds me of the pacu i have handled
5809900 i think once a year or so we get reports of someone catching what looks like a piranha or a pacu usually its in a river though
5809901 the next piranha i handle will be the first one
5809902 i cast out and it circled my fly then circled it the other way then bumped it before finally taking it
5809903 the ground is heavy and very deep hes in now but he has to be a doubt
5809904 its far from ideal and will be totally against him but knowing the horse he is the owners might let him run well talk about it tomorrow and make a decision
5809905 i always say a good horse can go on any ground i am a great believer in my horse hes tough and hes genuine
5809906 its a very exciting race and im looking forward to it its a clash of the titans and the best horse will win on the day
5809907 theyre selling greyhound racing down the river and well fight to keep it open to the bitter end
5809908 he was the first off the bridle and first past the winning line
5809909 if he gets his ground he is very hard to beat
5809910 i wasnt very impressed with the cherry hinton form so the lowther could be there for the taking she has an outstanding chance
5809911 if shed been beaten today that would be my 14th consecutive losing favourite
5809912 normally you couldnt put together 14 losing favourites in a row if you tried i should have laid them all on betfair
5809913 perhaps the most disappointing was dark missile at ascot on saturday

5809916 were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us
5809917 i think we are an unlikely runner on that ground the rain came against him at goodwood and we wouldnt want to run him again on soft ground
5809918 we have got a couple of options the following saturday theres the totesport beverley bullet and on the same day theres the hopeful stakes a listed race over six furlongs at newmarket
5809919 the forecast for the next couple of days is still unsettled so i think it will probably stay on the slow side
5809920 unfortunately i tested positive for a breath test which astonished me as i wasnt drinking late or doing anything silly on saturday night
5809921 its very unfortunate and im very disappointed in myself for letting sir mark and the owners down
5809922 its very embarrassing and i cant really tell people how disappointed i am with myself
5809923 its quite ironic really as me and my wife were chatting on the way over and saying this is the first time weve been out in about three months
5809924 it has honestly been a great day a great meeting and it has been a pleasure to be here
5809925 that wasnt the plan the plan was to be handy
5809926 shes a very nice filly has done nothing wrong and she will stay as well obviously she copes with any ground too
5809927 shes a nice type of filly she is not the biggest and is very active at home so we have just let her get on with it
5809928 shes handled it well today she got left behind and pulled very badly which makes it all the more impressive
5809929 all being well we will freshen her up and bring her back for the may hill at doncaster
5809930 were delighted hes returned to group winning form its been a while
5809931 he almost did it at ascot and last time at sandown it was too firm

5809933 henry entered him in the juddmonte at york in 10 days time but well have to see how he is
5809934 aidans mount nelson is a top horse in his own right a grade one winner in europe

5809936 aidan and johnny murtagh are in devastating form this season
5809937 its bound to be an exciting finish as kevin shea and johnny also renew the rivalry and sportsmanship they shared in dubai
5809938 arlington is similar to the sha tin racecourse in hong kong except it goes the other way round

5809940 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years

5809949 we started an initiative to heavily implement my access over the last three years in our junior high schools and after just one school year the results were eye opening
5809950 after we saw how effective my access was in improving writing skills district leaders began to lobby the state to underwrite more licenses so we could bring this wonderful technology to as many students as possible and working with the folks at vantage learning to customize my access demonstrates their commitment to helping our students reach their full potential
5809951 we work with hundreds of school districts across the country and listen closely to each educators needs
5809952 when these districts in utah said they wanted my access to better prepare students for the u pass state tests and help their growing ell student population we delivered a customized version of our award winning program to do just that now utah schools are experiencing the excitement and promise of this writing tool were delighted that we can serve so many educators with different needs

5809960 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5809961 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year

5809963 while the bbcs vast army of anonymous commentators bubble with breathless excitement the battle back in britain is to stay conscious
5809964 that is absolutely the greatest british relay swim i have ever seen
5809965 six men went to fight at the battle of light bulb hill only nine returned
5809966 ah today i just needed to spend some money as i have too much to spend so i bought myself an mp3 player that cost me about 800 bucks
5809967 ahah what else is this child going to do to me
5809968 you better hurry up and finish what you are doing
5809969 well i could call out when the going gets tough the things that weve learnt are no longer enough
5809970 in a church which accepts the legitimacy of contraception the absolute condemnation of same sex relations of intimacy must rely either on an abstract fundamentalist deployment of a number of very ambiguous texts or on a problematic and non scriptural theory about natural complementarity applied narrowly and crudely to physical differentiation without regard to psychological structures
5809971 your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad
5809972 the difference between sacramental and gnostic understandings of the human condition
5809973 depends on the object chosen the end in view or the intention the circumstances of the action
5809974 make up the sources or constitutive elements of the morality of human acts
5809975 is an essential element to the moral evaluation of an action
5809976 increasing or diminishing moral goodness or evil of a human act
5809977 by its very nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring
5809978 for matrimonial consent to exist the contracting parties must be at least not ignorant that marriage is a permanent partnership between a man and a woman ordered to the procreation of offspring by means of some sexual cooperation
5809979 if therefore there are well grounded reasons for spacing births arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife or from external circumstances the church teaches that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that are infertile thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which we have just explained
5809980 due to overwhelming response mesa has added a new educational track on service oriented architecture to help attendees in the ongoing formulation design and integration of soa in their production environments
5809981 in this track operations and it teams can learn how leading manufacturers are using soa to deliver on corporate strategic initiatives such as lean quality and plm
5809982 as the manufacturing solution landscape evolves both end users and solution providers are striving to discover common approaches that facilitate collaboration across applications people geographies and other perceived boundaries
5809983 this evolution in manufacturing mirrors the growing maturity of soa which continues to gain favor and use by practitioners around the world
5809984 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5809985 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5809986 the originality of this unexpectedly upbeat rites of passage film is a breath of fresh air
5809987 it looks like a costume a waterlogged costume thats been stuffed into a freezer
5809988 it just doesnt have the hallmark of a real corpse
5809989 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
5809990 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
5809991 it does look like birmingham englands recycling effort is working they are even recycling photographs
5809992 it seems birmingham england council is about as smart as our city council
5809993 looks like our birmingham isnt the only one with a lot of less than sharp people in charge
5809994 thats pretty funny but if this were a brochure on crime prevention that would be hilarious
5809995 ive found where the photo originates its on the second page of a google images search for birmingham skyline although it does come from istockphoto so theyve paid for it
5809996 it would be difficult mistake to make alabama is clearly in the description of the photo so maybe were not crediting the council design department with a touch of wry humour thatd be better than them being stupid wouldnt it
5809997 the photos were of birmingham englands city centre and were taken down within 48 hours
5809998 our site receives some steady traffic from the uk and has several folks subscribe to our newsletter who seem to have an interest in whats going on over here
