5660030 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset
5660031 its a misnomer to say hes doing this with the countrys best interests at heart because hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
5660032 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5660033 gave both candidates the first two questions because he didnt want them to be nervous so they would be at ease
5660034 ill probably ask you a question on this or on that

5660037 heuliez expanded in the belief that the retractable hardtop market would expand
5660038 almost immediately i saw that heuliez had to be an electric car company
5660039 we hope to create a low cost electric car designed in france procured globally and manufactured in france
5660040 using the same number of people to build far more vehicles
5660041 weve been working on the electric car very quietly for the past six months
5660042 we should be completing our final iterations in the next three to four months
5660043 i would say that one year from now we should be in a position to sell the car in europe
5660044 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
5660045 wir mussten die nacht durchk mpfen und es geht weiter
5660046 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
5660047 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time

5660093 while we felt that this was an important issue on principle and are disappointed that the legislature refused to follow the information commissioners ruling we have to pick and choose when to fight this fight
5660094 we feel the information were releasing which is the amount of the donation with the persons name redacted is as much as were willing to disclose

5660141 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5660142 some have looked to the mpc to cut its interest rate to help but our job is to fight inflation because thats the best basis for the economy to grow to create jobs and allow living standards to rise

5660153 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
5660154 there is a lot of speculation let me categorically say that we are not pursuing hummer

5660188 george romero plain and simple throws together some of the most thought provoking and compelling horror films even a lesser effort like
5660189 he real reason to dig through the supplements on this release is one for the fire a brand new and insanely comprehensive documentary on the making of and history of night of the living dead clocking in at almost an hour and a half long this fascinating look back at the picture includes on camera interviews with almost everyone associated with the film who excluding those who have passed away obviously look for input from romero and russo cast members odea hinzman schon eastman and ricci crewmembers like regis survinski and gary streiner fans like alice cooper max brooks greg nicotero steve barton camden toy and bill mosely billy cardille and many more in addition to the interview clips we get a tour of the building that was where all the latent image film work was stored which also doubled as the basement in the film we get modern day visits to some of the locations with cast members in tow and we get a chance to see some of the commercials that latent image made before night of the living dead its a fascinating and sometimes sad story particularly when we learn about the circumstances surrounding how the film fell into the public domain which would wind up losing the filmmakers an untold amount of money this documentary alone makes this release worth a purchase its that good while completists will absolutely want to hold on to the elite edition for the extras and because of the framing issues on the new transfer this new fortieth anniversary edition of night of the living dead really is excellent the new transfer is at times a revelation and the inclusion of the one for the fire documentary really adds a lot of value to this package highly recommended ian also took a look at the lionsgate release of the american remake of the pang brothers thai hit the eye it seems that with films like one missed call and shutter cruising through theaters over the last year or so that asian horror remakes are a trend that isnt going to go away soon despite the fact that the remakes are rarely as inspired as the original films such is the case with as generic and mediocre as the eye is the film is still a fairly entertaining popcorn movie it has almost zero replay value and the supplements arent strong enough to add much value but the movie is worth a watch even if its unlikely that anyone will consider this a must own release rent it
5660190 in the hands of very talented directors this remake sadly becomes a listless effort its not scary or original resorting to overused devices to try and fake the fear its guilty of the biggest sin a thriller can make its just plain boring its a mild rental recommendation for horror lightweights who havent seen many of the films it mimics but if youve seen those youd probably do best to skip it
5660191 while not a classic the eye delivers some solid pg 13 level frights its entertaining and surprisingly character driven recommended
5660192 is a wild mix of seventies psychedelics and occult quirk that makes for a truly quirky watch andrew prine is great in the lead and the film might work better as a cultural artifact than an actual horror picture but regardless it remains an interesting and well made movie and dark sky has done a very nice job on the dvd debut
5660193 almost a decent thriller in here somewhere but the eye is dragged down by its lack of worthwhile scares and an earnest but stilted leading turn by jessica alba the eye is well watchable pun intended and even though this isnt a great horror flick by any stretch i dont think itd make for a bad rental
5660194 one of argentos more underrated efforts the stendhal syndrome is finally given a proper domestic release in north american with fantastic audio and video quality and a wealth of interesting extras that not only document the making of the film but which lend some very welcome insight into the unique condition that inspired it in the first place highly recommended

5660196 the recent fall in the price of oil and the fall of the euro against the dollar must have dampened economic concerns about the economy

5660221 is a movement that adores bullies from bill oreilly to george allen to michelle malkin a pundit with the appearance of a bratz doll but the soul of chucky
5660222 we can now say of that philosophy which regards good government as a laughable impossibility which elevates bullies and gangsters and ceos above other humans which tells us to get wise and stop expecting anything good from washington we can now say with finality that it has had its chance whenever there was a choice to be made between markets and free people between money and the common good the conservatives chose money its time to make them answer for it

5660230 the honor didnt hit me until i saw who i would be sharing the stage with today people like caryl parry jones and lord dafydd elis thomas i cant believe im being included among them
5660231 its really humbling to be in their number i was brought up an eisteddfodwr i used to compete in the urdd eisteddfod perhaps not as much as i should when i was young i used to compete or try to compete it had a big effect on me as a child

5660234 practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all what theyre trying to do is to widen their territorial presence
5660235 they have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action they are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now
5660236 i might be naive but im still hopeful that a very strong common effort by europe and the united states will be effective in the withdrawing of russian troops from territory of georgia
5660237 according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5660238 war columns are already leaving the main pullout will take place today it takes a long time to pack up a tank

5660281 papi was an immigrant all his life born in lugo galicia spain he migrated as a child to cuba where teased by his classmates he quickly dropped his spanish accent for the cuban accent he worked hard all his life at the age of 14 he worked side by side with his father while going to school as well he barely got 3 5 hours of sleep at the age of 21 he had achieved his dream to own his own business a restaurant bar named wall street in the 60s he left cuba as soon as he could and moved back to spain where he met my mother who was also fleeing cuba they settled in puerto rico where he worked for a while as a salesman for kimberly clarke but papi was a hard worker and he liked to own his business so once he had enough capital he and three other spaniards he had befriended in the island created a partnership of four panaderias papi loved us all very much but his panaderia was the love of his life the picture above was the opening day of said partnership and that is how i want everyone to remember my father
5660282 his full name was jesus mar a boveda carvallo originally from lugo galicia
5660283 spanish immigration began on a lavish scale a bizarre consequence of the severance of cubas last formal ties with the homeland
5660284 economic recovery from the war and improved medicine and health were partly responsible but immigration from spain was almost as important bloggers emphasis between 1902 and 1910 almost 200 000 spaniards mostly gallegos or asturians emigrated to cuba attracted by opportunities for high wages
5660285 my father your grandfather dario took advantage of legislation promoted by president estrada palma allowing spaniards who were in cuba and were willing to swear loyalty to the new republic the opportunity to become cuban citizens in fact president estrada palma opened the doors to immigration from spain he believed spaniards were sons and daughters of cuba and we were as family regardless of the conflict in which cubans and spaniards had engaged in not so long before his presidency so your grandfather as well as many others took advantage of this generosity and stayed in cuba becoming citizens of the republic
5660286 your grandfather and his brothers nicanor and alvaro left spain for cuba hoping to avoid military service they did not look forward to fighting cuban rebels or any other foes nevertheless shortly after they arrived in cuba sometime in 1897 they were inducted into the spanish army because your grandfather had flat feet and considered unable to do heavy marching was posted to an artillery battery in la cabana fortress his brothers alvaro and nicanor did go into the infantry and saw some action when a troop train they were being transported in was derailed by the cuban rebels the mambises
5660287 after the war ended the spanish american war your grandfather dario stayed in cuba with brothers alvaro nicanor alberto and constantino
5660288 my father had to return to spain to monforte uncles alberto and constantino decided to find opportunity in the united states and went to new orleans together with their brother alvaro my other uncle nicanor stayed in cuba once in spain my father earned a living as an itinerant salesman selling jewelry this is how he met my mother stopping during one of his travels at the village of caldelas de tuy in pontevedra province he stayed at the hotel enriquez owned by my mothers family mom worked with her family at the hotel so they met courted and then married in may 1910
5660289 eventually things started going better with my father and he returned to cuba in 1922 to help his brothers alberto and constantino who were in business importing eggs from new orleans by way of their brother alvaros wholesale egg company alvaro had founded in new orleans
5660290 my father decided it was time for the rest of the family to join him so he purchased steamship tickets for us and instructed mother to prepare for travel to havana
5660291 in the 1950s the mayor of havana justo luis del pozo decreed changes in the street addressing system of havana to make addresses clearer and more rational
5660292 they had very little money so they hitched rides on railcars illegally of course and went north to cincinnati ohio there they found work as waiters at the beverly hills hotel which was a posh place in those days one thing alberto was a hairy type and had a lot of hair on his arms when he applied for the waiter position whoever was sizing him up for the job told him hed have to shave his arms alberto was a little upset at that and explained that since he would be wearing a long sleeved dress shirt he did not see how anyone would notice well the boss or boss to be replied that he could see hairs sticking out of the shirt sleeves and albert could either shave his arms or forget being a waiter albert shaved his arms
5660293 constitutional rights being trampled because i am being discriminated against for having hairy arms i will complain to the hairy arms protection league
5660294 actors and actresses stayed at the beverly hills in those days and dined there alberto and constantino told me once how they waitered for the actor al jolson several times they considered him a good tipper because he gave 50 cent tips
5660295 why has he not said much about his mothers side of the family did he not care for them where they black sheep
5660296 it was calle del rio but do not remember the address exactly
5660297 who could have foreseen tom cruise nearly stealing the movie in a fat suit a prosthetic nose a skinhead wig and an austin powers style mat of chest fur
5660298 cruise is always at his best when hes skewering some unpleasant aspect of his own persona thus the crazed motivational speaker he played in magnolia was a career high point and the supremely crude les grossman is another
5660299 if youre trying to improve your image you want to get attention but you want to stay in the realm of eliciting a positive reaction for tom this role takes us back to what made him a superstar in the first place it reminded us that he can act
5660300 i think toms comeback isnt as mission impossible as were making it out to be
5660301 while i dont see his role in tropic thunder as a character changing event i do see it as a step in the right direction
5660302 theyre in good shape considering it was an emergency and they had no time to come up with an alternate plan
5660303 one of the things i appreciate about the boy scouts is that parents are involved
5660304 and they give kids the freedom to understand their limitations
5660305 theyll have a story to tell and be able to compare when they get back
5660306 i would be concerned about going places only accessible by helicopter or anywhere i couldnt reach him quickly
5660307 what did he know and when did he know it
5660308 t here is no indication that the president knew about any of the ongoing discussions about firing u s attorneys over the two years nor did he see a list or a plan before it was carried out
5660309 is very consciously trying to walk a very fine tightrope
5660310 if they said bush wasnt involved at all they would undermine their case for executive privilege
5660311 they said these measurements just arent right hes too long
5660312 and at four months he had all of his teeth

5660325 tim parker was supposed to be the cornerstone of boris johnsons administration his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one
5660326 this is the third resignation of one of boris johnsons most senior officers in only three months following deputy mayor ray lewis and deputy chief of staff james mcgrath and other deputy mayors and top appointees are known to be at one anothers throats within city hall
5660327 all this flows from boris johnsons incoherent policies for london and therefore incapacity to run the city
5660328 while some tory sections of the press gave a glowing evaluation of boris johnsons first 100 days the reality was quite different and those following the administration closely were fully aware of the growing chaos at its heart
5660329 this latest resignation after boris johnsons deputy chief of staff and his deputy ray lewis indicates how unfit the tories are not only to run london but also the country
5660330 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5660331 relatively few have acted on the global trends with the most influence over supply chains
5660332 when possible companies seek to maximize economies of scale in the supply chain and many companies treat it as a shared utility of the broader organization not only to take advantage of synergies but also to strengthen their operational expertise
5660333 the values we set have been really really good this time
5660334 most of the calls and questions we got were about how the new property values would affect our taxes and we dont have anything to do with that
5660335 people are going to realize exactly what the tax burden really is then
5660336 maybe they dont really understand whats going to happen but weve done everything to make the homeowner aware
5660337 and the card didnt tell them when the deadline was to file a tax protest
5660338 when i see something in the news that affects the city of gulfport i investigate it and when someone asks for our help as mr skrmetta did well then obviously hes not getting it from his council person
5660339 i am a council person for all of gulfport not just ward 7
5660340 we have the same two city council members taking the lead and trying to stop progress and as usual theyre wrong factually incorrect

5660368 stephen did really well because a lot of players would have went down as if they had been pole axed
5660369 i can also think of a few who would have been stretchered off before coming back on to resume the game
5660370 but stephen craigan the consummate professional that he is didnt go down and probably saved the lad
5660371 of course we have seen referees give red cards for such an action i think if the match official sees it he has to do something about it
5660372 i dont think he should have sent him off but he could maybe warn him or book him
5660373 in the end though my player hasnt overreacted and in doing so has prevented an opponent from being in trouble with the ref
5660374 were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5660375 the basic problem with optical or acoustic signals is that the drivers attention might be elsewhere either because he she is on the phone or chatting to a passenger for example and as a result fails to note the warning

5660382 its great that the city was able to get this school opened up
5660383 the school is going to be a wonderful institution not only for the students but for all of ramadi as the youth of the city continue to earn an education they will assist the city and the province in making their country prosperous
5660384 this school will allow young people from all across al anbar to come and learn a trade it also has the added benefit of getting the young males off the streets and giving them something productive to do this school will give them opportunity to become functioning members of society
5660385 our inflation figures are way above that we really need to change the way we do business
5660386 it may be related to the government expenditure around the elections although i dont have the details

5660820 a full functioning notebook is still the way to go for most of our users
5660821 it all depends on your workload and what youre doing
5660822 asus came out with the netbook and threw everybody a little bit of a curve by providing a very low cost kind of stripped down version of the notebook
5660823 it started catching on in certain markets but it became pretty clear pretty fast that a netbook was really not enough to meet the needs of a consumer especially in the u s and europe
5660824 we want access to the internet in one way shape or form
5660825 when im on the beach or going for coffee or going shopping or what have you i want to access the internet in something that is as personal to me as my wristwatch or my cell phone
5660826 if youre walking around youre not going to create a 3 d map of your house on a pocket device youre not going to run an animation when youre on vacation you are not going to create a 50 page presentation on that handheld device

5660828 what were seeing is an upticking demand for smartphones with apple leading the way in the context of being the gold standard and forcing the rest of the smartphone vendors to respond in kind

5660836 nearly one third of 14 year olds fail to reach the required standards in english maths and science a worse performance than last year according to todays key stage 3 sats results
5660837 the percentage of pupils achieving the expected level 5 in ks3 tests in english and maths combined is 66 a fall of one percentage point on last years figures
5660838 the schools minister jim knight congratulated schools on their results
5660839 we are giving schools the tools they need massive investment in support for teachers more support for childrens wider needs and the new secondary curriculum starting next month which will give them real flexibility over how they teach and the confidence to intervene earlier to give support to the right children at the right time in the right way
5660840 but teachers argued that the results could not be relied upon and urged the government to halt sats and review assessment
5660841 the shadow schools minister nick gibb said the government had failed to raise standards
5660842 the liberal democrats children spokesperson annette brooke said it was time for sats to be scrapped
5660843 there has been another increase in the a level pass rate and the proportion of entries awarded the top a grade like the girls at right
5660844 figures from the joint council for qualifications show 97 2 of entries in england wales and northern ireland passed up from 96 9
5660845 a grades went to 25 9 of the entries up from 25 3 and in northern ireland more than a third achieved an a
5660846 there were a record 827 737 a level entries and 1 13 million as levels this year from more than 600 000 students
5660847 problems with the marking of the tests taken by 1 2 million 11 and 14 year olds in england delayed results and prompted concerns about quality
5660848 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5660849 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard

5660854 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5660855 people were pushed out of their homes literally with the clothes on their back
5660856 there is no one situation that applies to every one of the locales
5660857 our goal in this operation is to save lives and to alleviate the suffering of the georgian people
5660858 osprey are fish eating hawks at the top of the aquatic food chain

5660862 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5660863 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5660864 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5660865 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5660866 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5660867 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5660868 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5660869 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought
5660870 after finding this kind of intelligence in apes many people thought it had developed once in one evolutionary line with humans at the end the bird studies show it has developed at least twice

5660873 this gene is under expressed in these patients and it seems to cause them to have about an 8 7 times more likely greater likelihood of contracting colon cancer than if you dont have this particular genetic finding
5660874 once you identify a patient who has this characteristic we would want to offer testing to all of their brothers and sisters and children to let them know whether they have inherited this characteristic and also have an increased risk for cancer
5660875 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5660876 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5660877 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before

5660883 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5660884 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5660885 were looking at dumping the whole dinner on top of them and seeing what happens
5660886 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5660887 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5660888 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5660889 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5660890 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5660891 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5660892 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5660893 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5660894 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5660895 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass
5660896 the long term economic potential of latin america makes this an extremely important market for video games
5660897 nintendo has experienced phenomenal growth in the region over the past few years growth that has even surpassed what we have seen in the united states

5660903 she should be here within the next couple of weeks
5660904 i think were all on a high shes over the moon
5660905 the neighbours have been sitting at their tvs all weekend its something else
5660906 i think shes done brilliantly especially as she only turned professional about three years ago and shes reached olympic level
5660907 she played hockey at school and she started off with horseriding before she went to university in dundee then she went to running and did the london marathon she got quite a few medals in running
5660908 ian is a cyclist but not a professional she was soon beating him up hills
5660909 she said she was going in to give it her best and see how she did
5660910 i think she did awfully well and im so proud of her its brilliant its just brilliant
5660911 ea is saying we want to pay less take two is saying they want more the important thing is that they are talking

5660913 the human genome project gave us a catalogue of all genes in 2003 and we now know what a few of them do
5660914 we are now able to move on and ask questions about what turns genes on and off and regulates their activity
5660915 the rate of gene expression from the underlying genomic sequence is also influenced by microrna and other non coding regulatory rnas that also act to expose or hide genes from the transcription machinery
5660916 epigenetics is already providing a whole raft of new insights into the causes of disease and with those insights will come new opportunities to test for epigenetic abnormalities in patients whose genes appear normal
5660917 we now know that virtually all malignancies are associated with multiple methylation abnormalities two mechanisms are involved very often cancerous cells will exhibit global hypermethylation or specific tumour suppressor genes will be selectively methylated abolishing gene expression
5660918 our search implementation is based on a customized version of the lucene open source platform

5660973 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5660974 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5660975 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5660976 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5660977 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5661007 hosiery items worth millions of rupees will be left unsold unless the government takes measures to transport woollens from ludhiana to jammu and kashmir
5661008 as winter ends we start making woollen items like sweaters jackets shawls and caps for the next season this time we procured a huge quantity of blankets from other states as the demand is quite good in the kashmir valley but the highway blockade has severely affected our business

5661167 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5661168 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5661169 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5661170 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5661171 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5661172 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

5661190 for us its a success this line has been derived without exposing the cells to animal components like foetal bovine serum which is the case in most of the lines available in the different laboratories now

5661198 it is really just about minimising the risks from field to fork with a series of simple measures
5661199 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated

5661207 it wasnt surprising to see that parchman farms self titled debut was recorded in san francisco its pure unfiltered late 60s rock direct from haight ashbury but without the irritating hippy trappings what gives the five songs on this excellent disc distinction are the warm bass tones and the sweet crosby stills and nash like harmonies the groove is everywhere all of the songs are great to some it may sound dated but i prefer to think parchman farm have tapped into a timeless sound highly recommended especially for fans of grand funk railroad

5661209 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5661210 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5661211 its the perfect start more than i expected the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game and three points we have to keep this going we can every game every week i dont know but well try
5661212 it is disappointing to get further injuries on top of what we are missing he said
5661213 i havent too many complaints though we have done our best with what was available
5661214 we had the most possession but didnt make it count carlos tevez will be back next week and wayne rooney will be much sharper that will be our strike force i am happy to continue that way drawing is not the result i wanted but you cant be too disappointed
5661215 i didnt think we were sharp enough to finish what he created when everybody is fit we will create more clear cut chances
5661216 you cant afford to switch off and the give the opposition the amount of time and space we did
5661217 this was a great day but the players will keep their feet on the ground they know they have a tough season in front of them
5661218 i was up all night worrying about what it might be like as a premier league manager but the camaraderie the team showed was unbelievable
5661219 mikel has got goals in him and we know we are going to need that from the middle of the park this year said moyes
5661220 he needs to try and score more often than he did last season
5661221 he got nine two seasons ago compared with four last season and although some of them were penalties he has the ability to score good goals he still has a bit of work to do to get to the level we want but he is not feeling the injury he just needs match practice
5661222 he has done a lot of training to get back where we wanted him in fact he has worked harder than anybody and tried to get himself in good shape but we need to keep pushing him because he is an important player for us
5661223 we needed a result to keep our form going and give something to the fans they have been waiting for something psv are a champions league team and a passing team if we can get results against the likes of them im sure we will be fine
5661224 the team is working hard and we are doing the best we can we need to be ready now for the weekend which is going to be a massive game for us we want to start as well as we did over the last few years winning
5661225 i think we need to stop talking about the new signings the manager and the chairman know what is good for the club they know what they are doing
5661226 the manager is very keen to bring in top players and he has been waiting he wants to bring in three or four class players and we have got a few weeks left until the transfer window closes so hopefully we will do it
5661227 but you cant look back and theres no reason we cant be competing for the next two or three big tournaments
5661228 the euros are gone and you have to move on to the next challenge
5661229 the manager brings a pedigree thats second to none when he tells you to do something you do it hes a great leader and all the lads really respect him first and foremost he wants us to win and as we spend more time together and keep improving we will keep on moving forward
5661230 you have to squeeze all the time you can out of these friendlies because time is precious for international squads
5661231 i dont normally pick anyone out but reuben hazell and sean gregan dealt with two very awkward players in jermaine beckford and enoch showunmi said sheridan
5661232 chris taylor will get the headlines but it was a very good team performance
5661233 other than from set pieces i couldnt see leeds scoring against us whereas we were dangerous on the break that result and performance will give us confidence and belief and hopefully we will be consistent if we are we will be up there at the end of the season though these are very early days i have told the players to go out have a weekend pint and enjoy the rewards for that performance
5661234 the performance from our players wasnt good enough from one to 11 i thought the players would be brimming with confidence and looking to turn it on for the fans but we never got going there is no excuse it wasnt acceptable and they were scrappy goals to concede
5661235 we played some excellent football and have got off to a good start we were very good going forward but a bit loose at the back
5661236 we got better in the second half and i cant fault my players application and performance
5661237 im pleased with how they went about things both sides went for it and stockport like to play football there arent going to be any easy games in this division but weve got a decent squad and decent quality weve just got to strive to hit the level of performance required week in week out
5661238 colin hawkins was adjudged to have tugged a shirt but the boy craig disley had lost the ball and the referee was trying to even things up
5661239 we played really well and i told them afterwards to get some more confidence from this and believe that we can go on to bigger things
5661240 in general i have to say it is a very good group of players i am very pleased with everyone and as i said from the beginning i want to build on that i am delighted i think the team did really well and we now have two clean sheets from our first two home games
5661241 i never doubted that we would win the game and i told the lads at half time to be patient keep passing the ball and ignore the crowd who would want us to throw people forward and leave gaps said saddlers boss jimmy mullen
5661242 scunthorpe made it difficult for us with two banks of four but we kept our composure and discipline and eventually got our just rewards
5661243 these two players are going to score plenty of goals again this season
5661244 i am delighted with the result and a thoroughly professional performance had we lost this game a lot of people would have been questioning whether we can handle it at this level but i had a feeling from as far back as thursday that this would be a good afternoon for us
5661245 we had plenty of chances to win the game we had all the possession in the second half but we were sloppy went to sleep and it has cost us twice
5661246 the way we lost goals has been a bit of an achilles heel of ours and is something weve got to work on
5661247 we are close to doing something with robbie hes been different class in training in the last few days robbie is a premier league goalscorer and he always will be but the only issue is getting his sharpness back
5661248 it is a huge blow for valeri he has had a terrible spell with injury we are all disappointed for him but he will have to come back again
5661249 he had worked really hard he did really well in pre season and i picked him to start against villa on merit because of that his injury was not the ideal preparation for the match because the other players understood how upset he was it was hard to take
5661250 in two games in the championship ive played little more than 30 minutes he said
5661251 its so frustrating all i can do when i get a little chance is come on and take it
5661252 hes that little bit extra special he can create a goal out of nothing if youve got that youve always got an edge said coleman
5661253 chris is the striker ive been seeking for the past two seasons he has been a revelation about the place and had to play after his goals on tuesday we play with wingers and are a threat to anybody on our own pitch and im delighted everything has settled down so quickly
5661254 if he keeps scoring like that then i would have paid 10 million for him and i think i would have been right to do that
5661255 it was good to see him out there and scoring goals ibrahima made a bad judgement call last season and a bit of a situation developed between us but it was all resolved when i spoke to him
5661256 nous avons tous la responsabilit de sauver notre pays du stade actuel
5661257 imaginez que tous les tudiants doxford essaient de se connecter depuis une seule connexion domestique
5661258 three wins in the first week of the season is excellent and i couldnt have asked for any more effort or commitment from my lads
5661259 we looked confident all the way through we passed the ball well and moved it well you always want more but it was a really professional performance and we are another three points nearer the zero mark and have put more distance between the clubs behind us
5661260 its only early days but i am very encouraged by what i have seen so far said manager keith hill
5661261 the performances so far have been good im pleased with the way we are passing and looking to be creative there is no fear and ultimately we are not really conceding goals
5661262 we know what we are capable of doing and thats the important thing for us we know there are other strong teams in the league but its about 46 games not two games we have 44 games left and people will be jumping to conclusions as they do in the early stages of the season but we are encouraged and we are going forward
5661263 we are very fit you cant play well every week but you can be well organised every week
5661264 hes got great quality with his left and right foot and he showed that said shrewsburys boss
5661265 i would say that hes probably only playing at 60 to 65 per cent of his fitness at the moment
5661266 youve got to have a man on the end to take the chances and we have that in peter thorne said a bullish bantams boss
5661267 i am delighted to come to a club that is probably one of the favourites to get promotion and win the game quite comfortably
5661268 i think this is a massive statement for two reasons although its still very early in the season we have shown we are ready and that we have got a decent squad that has a strong will to win and wants to get better
5661269 we have also shown that we are not a one man team in andy bishop we want to take the pressure off him and andy morrell has come in and done really well with glynn hurst morrell hardly ever stands still he gives us enthusiasm energy and obviously goals
5661270 these players can be heroes for this football club this was a massive game for the football club and the players have proved to me and the supporters that they can come away and scrap it out
5661271 that will bode well for the future the work rate the effort and the commitment from our lads showed their desire and passion to do well for this football club it was there for all to see and the defending was fantastic that alone was a reason we deserved to win
5661272 within two minutes i called the players together and said if this is what im going to see we might as well go home
5661273 we scored some good goals and we finished up well clear in both games but we havent to get carried away its early days yet we defended well when we needed to and there was a lot of good work in midfield as the games wore on
5661274 it is frustrating when you consider how well pre season went for us and that just went out of the window said moore
5661275 we have got to defend better than that and make ourselves hard to beat there are no positives to come out of a 3 1 defeat like that
5661276 the two goals that we gave away were diabolical ones to concede he said after the defeat at orient
5661277 i thought we showed them too much respect and gave them too much room and time on the ball its a new experience for a lot of our players and we have to believe that we can live with good sides like leyton orient
5661278 we dont have a hard luck story he added after the 2 1 defeat at crystal palace
5661279 its now down to the players to show that they have the bottle to bounce back against yeovil on saturday
5661280 josh made three world class saves and in the first half we could have been two or three goals down but we weathered the storm and came into our own
5661281 id be disappointed if i didnt have people interested in jermaine but were trying to get things going at our place and hes one of the better players
5661282 hes on a lengthy contract and nobody will leave the club unless i want them to go thats what the chairman has said to me so i trust him
5661283 we got the result in the end but if there had been some tea cups within reach in the dressing room at half time they would have probably been thrown he said
5661284 steve brooker came up trumps for us with a late goal for the second successive game but the whole team improved in the second half
5661285 we got there in the end and we deserved to win the game no question about that but it would have been nice if we had done it sooner but they made it difficult for us
5661286 any side manchester united puts out is a fantastic one we just felt we had a bit more pace than them and there was a really good feeling about the squad before the game
5661287 if he has said that he must do it i dont know what people have said i dont really read it too often in the recent past we have bought players who have not been quite good enough they have either not settled or not understood what it means to play for newcastle you cant just say good players can play at newcastle because history will prove they cannot
5661288 i am delighted that the deal is now done fabricio has got tremendous experience and is a full international with argentina that tells you he is a player of the very highest calibre he does not know the premier league but he knows world football and has played in one of the top leagues la liga for six years now hes a very athletic player he played every minute in the league for his club last season and hes also very versatile he is a centre back but can play anywhere across the back four and also in midfield he gives us massive options
5661289 the last player we want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving shola ameobi is talking to ipswich but after that there will be nobody else going out and we want one or two more coming in and what we have to do is to make sure we get better players coming in than those who are going out and that will take some doing as far as our signings have been concerned the quantity is low but the quality is very high
5661290 i dont think it has been a bad summer but then i have not been reading what has been written but in football at the moment you dont want these things on your doorstep at your club it is nice to get a good result at manchester united so it goes on to another club but i dont envy whoever it is

5661307 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5661308 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

5661417 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5661418 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5661419 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5661420 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5661421 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5661422 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5661423 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5661424 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5661425 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5661426 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5661427 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5661428 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5661429 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5661430 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5661431 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5661432 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5661433 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship

5661485 die pzero reifen haben sehr gut funktioniert besonders gilt das f r die weichen mischungen die gut durchgehalten haben
5661486 speziell auch da die temperaturen oft h her waren als vorhergesagt im trockenen haben beide von pirelli gelieferten mischungen sehr effektiv funktioniert jetzt bin ich neugierig wie diese reifen auf nassem asphalt arbeiten im unterschied zu den meisten veranstaltungen in den vorjahren haben wir dieses jahr bei der rallye deutschland keinen regen gesehen
5661487 dieser 150 sieg in der rallye wm ist eine gro e anerkennung f r pirellis dauerhaftes engagement im rennsport in den letzten jahrzehnten
5661488 seit 1973 haben wir erfolgreich reifen geliefert und rallyes gewonnen und dies mit den unterschiedlichsten fahrzeugen und unter den verschiedensten bedingungen diese siege wurden sowohl von gro en champions als auch von weniger bekannten fahrern erzielt es ist jedoch eine besondere freude dass dieser meilenstein von s bastien loeb erzielt wurde der sicher zu den besten rallyefahrern aller zeiten geh rt
5661489 was die technische seite angeht so bin ich sehr zufrieden dass wir das zeitenniveau der letzten rallyes hier in deutschland halten und teilweise auch verbessern konnten
5661490 nicht zu vergessen damals konnten wir die reifen konstant weiterentwickeln und verwendeten zudem reifenmousse gegen luftverlust die aktuelle situation mit den regelungen f r die einheitsreifen unterscheidet sich davon grundlegend

5661499 musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan it is in the interests of the pakistani people to end the political crisis that has immobilised the coalition government for too long
5661500 i had advocated the us move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy the opportunity created by musharrafs exit must be utilised to focus on issues like terrorism food and energy shortages and to help people there build a stable secure and democratic future
5661501 us policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaeda and the taliban there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people
5661502 belief that he alone was a saint and all others villains
5661503 the day climaxing a silent revolution will go down as a major landmark of our history and may leave some important lessons for those who had been used to nursing bonapartist notions
5661504 after musharrafs exit the ruling coalition will have to accept the responsibility of running the government because from now on it would not be able to find anyone else to shift the blame for its failures

5661511 this new investment from emergence amplifies the immediate opportunity for lotame
5661512 another important piece of this event is the addition of emergences jason green as a respected and pivotal team member to our board

5661521 either these machines were downgraded by sellers like dell or hp or they were downgraded by the user after they got the machine
5661522 in any case these machines are no longer running vista
5661523 the 35 percent is only an estimate but it shows a trend within our own user base
5661524 vistas installed base certainly doesnt equal the number of vista licences that microsofts sold
5661525 this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
5661526 we are not in the position to speculate on the outcome of the investigation but after several incidents like these it would be appropriate for apple to take some measures to raise the publics awareness

5661534 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
5661535 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
5661536 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
5661537 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
5661538 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
5661539 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
5661540 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos

5661544 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
5661545 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
5661546 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
5661547 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
5661548 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
5661549 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

5661552 the time when i began to see the most clearly was after i turned 30 i was 31 or 32 and i quit smoking i was so emotional i mean everybody is emotional when they quit smoking but i had been so unhappy and i realised that i had just been i dont know literally stuffing it back with those cigarettes in my mouth i felt like i woke up suddenly

5661580 we are giving work to law firms that are doing it right
5661581 and were taking work frankly from those that arent doing it
5661582 i tried to downplay my alpha maleness by wearing a pink tie so she wouldnt feel that i was trying to challenge her
5661583 i tried to speak in a softer slightly higher voice so she wouldnt get unintentionally turned on by my manly deep voice
5661584 i didnt comb my hair over my bald spot when i appeared before her so that 1 shed feel superior to me in that she had more hair than i do and 2 would be repulsed by my baldness and thus not overcome by her lust for me
5661585 i pulled out the ol earring from college and popped it into my left ear just so that she could relate better to me
5661586 many young lawyers both men and women find that the culture in law firms is not conducive to a balanced humane life young lawyers want more balance in their lives they are not willing to sacrifice all other aspects of life family volunteer activities community involvement physical and mental health for work
5661587 i get concerned about programs that dont accomplish things and wind up being an object of ridicule
5661588 an impromptu modeling of shoes to determine if either pair represented
5661589 offended by too short skirts too much cleavage or too much arm being shown and running shoes being worn in the courthouse
5661590 all attorneys should wear appropriate attire men shall wear coats ties slacks and appropriate footwear which does not include athletic shoes or shoes without socks women shall wear professional and conservative attire such as dresses with jackets suits or pantsuits with appropriate tops and appropriate footwear which does not include cocktail shoes or sandals or athletic shoes
5661591 so i would respectfully suggest my fellow lawyers that you take your dress code and implement it in a jurisdiction where the sun dont shine and the snow dont fall
5661592 professional men are much more likely to be married to homemakers or women who dont have the financial withdrawal to leave even if they want or need to
5661593 there arent careers where you cant have children there are careers where women cant have children so the question is are we going to design careers so that only men can have them if they want a conventional family life or are we going to design careers so that either men or women can have them if they want a conventional family life
5661594 female lawyers more likely to practice in firms less likely to make partner
5661595 analyzed data collected from two groups of michigan law school graduates the classes of 1972 78 and 1979 85 who completed surveys one five and 15 years after graduation
5661596 older men tend to feel less comfortable spending time with a young woman than with a young man with the guys its more of a father son bond lets play some golf lets hit happy hour and ill give you some advice about your career and see what i can do to help you
5661597 men might shy away from that type of mentoring relationship with a young woman because theyre afraid of what people will think
5661598 i really enjoyed the law but until your fifth or sixth year you are a paper pusher baretz said
5661599 its not that intellectually stimulating here im running a business negotiating deals pitching business
5661600 i wanted to work for myself and i was always thinking more about growing a business than being a lawyer in the usual sense
5661601 it is a difficult slog trying to make partner i dont talk to a lot of law firm lawyers who are really happy
5661602 i didnt dislike practicing law it was just that i always had this entrepreneur bug
5661603 a lot of people go to law school not really understanding what it means to practice law and how that impacts your life
5661604 going to law school at new york university opened a new city and way of thinking to me i put a lot of work into the law and i learned a lot but when i found something interesting i moved
5661605 initially it was a big hit to the bottom line i was doing extremely well at the law firm and not half as well at urbandaddy but when you love what you do and do it well the money comes
5661606 ik zat helemaal niet lekker in mijn vel mijn ouders maakten ruzie om lles ze zeiden vaak dat ze zouden scheiden zodra ik op mezelf ging wonen dat vond ik vreselijk om te horen hoe slecht hun relatie ook was ik wilde niet dat onze gezinssituatie zou veranderen ik besloot dat ik maar het beste zo min mogelijk kon eten als ik niet goed at werd ik ook niet groot en gezond en hoefde ik nooit het huis uit en zolang ik thuis bleef wonen zouden mijn ouders bij elkaar blijven
5661607 ik sloeg zelfs het avondeten over nou was dat niet moeilijk want die maaltijd was altijd een regelrechte ramp bij ons thuis mijn ouders maakten namelijk bij voorkeur ruzie aan tafel en die ruzies werden alleen maar heviger nadat mijn moeder had ontdekt dat mijn vader al twee jaar vreemdging ze schold elke avond op hem maar hem het huis uitzetten deed ze niet mijn vader vluchtte in de drank waar hij erg agressief van werd ik ben er regelmatig tussen gesprongen als hij mijn moeder wilde slaan en ving dus de klappen op ze hadden het zo druk met zichzelf dat het ze niet eens opviel dat ik bijna niets meer at ik dacht dat alle ouders waren als die van mij dat iedereen de schijn ophield en deed alsof alles prima ging maar dat alle mannen ondertussen hun vrouwen de hersens insloegen zodra de gordijnen dicht waren op school werd ik ook nog eens gepest omdat ik rood haar heb dat maakte me n g onzekerder ik wilde niet opvallen ik wilde me het liefst verstoppen en hoopte dat ik onzichtbaar zou worden als ik nog meer kilos kwijtraakte
5661608 ik was zeker tien kilo afgevallen de huisarts stuurde me door naar een psychiater een aardige man tegenover hem was ik voor het eerst eerlijk over mijn eetgedrag ik vond het wel prettig om met hem te praten het luchtte een beetje op eindelijk was er iemand die naar me luisterde hij stelde de diagnose anorexia en heeft mijn ouders ingelicht maar denk maar niet dat dat iets veranderde mijn ouders deden tegenover hem alsof ze schrokken van dit bericht maar eenmaal thuis kwamen ze verder niet op mijn ziekte terug
5661609 ik was de jongste ondernemer van emmen en daar was ik hartstikke trots op maar achteraf weet ik zeker dat mijn vader me alleen aan die baan heeft geholpen om aan de mensen in onze omgeving te laten zien wat een geweldige vader hij was
5661610 ik werkte ondertussen braaf in de stalling en met het geld dat ik verdiende probeerde ik mijn ouders gelukkig te maken ik kocht regelmatig cadeautjes voor ze ik was voortdurend aan het bemiddelen en schipperen om het thuis toch maar een beetje rustig te houden ondertussen bleef ik maar afvallen en omdat ik steeds zwakker werd kreeg ik meer en meer moeite met het werken in de fietsenstalling ik had het voortdurend koud en dronk de hele dag door thee om nog maar iets van warmte te voelen
5661611 jeroen werkte ook in de fietsenstalling en ik had wel eens met hem over mijn problemen thuis gepraat hij was bezorgd omdat ik niet op het werk was verschenen hij zei dat hij me heel lief vond en vroeg of ik soms een tijdje bij hem in zijn huis wilde komen wonen ik ben met hem meegegaan want ik wilde ondertussen zo graag bij mijn ouders weg hoe ziek ik ook was zij keken niet naar me om jeroen wel hij was zo lief voor me ik bracht hele dagen in bed door jeroen maakte van alles voor me klaar van brood tot bordjes rauwkost maar ik at het zelden op en als ik dat wel deed spuugde ik het later weer uit ik herinner me nog maar weinig van die periode omdat ik inmiddels zo verzwakt was dat zelfs mijn geheugen niet goed meer functioneerde jeroen is meerdere keren met me naar de huisarts gegaan omdat ik steeds flauwviel maar ik kon niet worden opgenomen in het ziekenhuis zolang ik dat niet zelf wilde naar de psychiater ging ik wel regelmatig maar hij kreeg mij ook niet zover dat ik mijn eetgedrag veranderde of dat ik me liet opnemen
5661612 ik weet niet hoe ze daarbij kwamen of waarom ze het zeiden ik denk dat ze bang waren mij kwijt te raken gek dat ze niet doorhadden dat ze mij niet kwijt raakten aan jeroen maar aan die ziekte waar ze overigens nog steeds geen belangstelling voor hadden ik denk ook dat ze voelden dat ze hun grip op mij kwijt raakten
5661613 heel confronterend vond ik de blikken van andere mensen als ik dan een keertje naar buiten ging wat ik bijna niet meer deed kijk een wandelend lijk hoorde ik ze fluisteren ik besefte dat ik zoveel was afgevallen maar dat ik blijkbaar n g niet onzichtbaar was geworden voor mij was dat een grote schok
5661614 jeroen heeft later verteld dat hij z bang was dat ik doodging hij werd gek van de gedachte dat hij mij zou verliezen aan deze vreselijke ziekte hij heeft me uiteindelijk naar het ziekenhuis gedr gen en daar zeiden ze dat een deel van mijn hersenen al was afgestorven ik weet alleen nog dat ik voortdurend paarden zag en geluiden hoorde alsof die beesten aan kwamen draven achteraf gezien waren dat hallucinaties die krijg je als je zo ondervoed bent
5661615 a recent landmark ruling by the high court takes the uk one step closer to becoming an
5661616 watch out for false prophets they come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves
5661617 therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock 25 the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock 26 but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand 27 the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash
5661618 my teaching is not my own it comes from him who sent me

5661624 for crying out loud lance hunt wears glasses captain amazing doesnt wear glasses
5661625 there is a misconception that being bilingual means you can also be an interpreter there is a lot of room for improvement in the standard of interpretation in singapore
5661626 sending desperate breadwinners to prison and their families deeper into poverty is another
5661627 the interpreter was able to accurately relay all of the doctors questions and thoroughly explain what i needed to know about my illness i finally gained an understanding of my medical condition and progress the treatment plan and what i needed to be cautious about this crucial understanding helped dispel my fears and drastically strengthened my faith in my own ability to recover and conquer the disease
5661628 i wasnt sure if i would be able to express myself what i was going through and whether i would be able to receive the care i needed but my anxiety quickly turned into joy and hope when i learned that the staff had arranged for a professional interpreter to assist me many of us as patients dont know that we are entitled to interpretation services when we go to the doctor some providers and administrators may know that they need to provide this service and yet they use untrained staff or anyone else to interpret matters about health that can be about life and death the solution to these problems i believe is to have more training for medical interpreters and to educate the public as well as the providers
5661629 what i find most rewarding as a health care interpreter is seeing the look of relief on peoples faces when they know they are able to communicate and understand everything during the session with their doctor they leave their appointment feeling assured that no question is left unanswered

5661685 were losing money as it is the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug
5661686 stephen did really well because a lot of players would have went down as if they had been pole axed
5661687 i can also think of a few who would have been stretchered off before coming back on to resume the game
5661688 but stephen craigan the consummate professional that he is didnt go down and probably saved the lad
5661689 of course we have seen referees give red cards for such an action i think if the match official sees it he has to do something about it
5661690 i dont think he should have sent him off but he could maybe warn him or book him
5661691 in the end though my player hasnt overreacted and in doing so has prevented an opponent from being in trouble with the ref
5661692 the next day when the organ met again he said he had spent the whole night reviewing the material and had not slept at all
5661693 he said his analysis of the situation was that tsvangirai had misled them on zimbabwes political processes
5661694 he said they had been misinformed and were of the opinion that tsvangirai should accept the agreement that president mbeki had facilitated as it was quite reasonable his exact words were what more does tsvangirai expect but we cannot order him to accept the agreement all we can do is try and persuade him to see sense
5661695 president kikwete said he was quite embarrassed by tsvangirais performance before the organ on friday night where he demanded that sadc leaders force president mugabe to cede all executive powers he apologised to president mbeki and said his earlier position was not borne out of malice but out of misinformation given to them by tsvangirai
5661696 odinga told him that after seeing the document he was sure that tsvangirai was being offered a lot by president mugabe and it would be foolish to turn it down odinga said even i dont have that much power here
5661697 my bubble of enthusiasm for presidential politics was really deflated
5661698 some people might get discouraged from getting involved because they really believed in him and he let them down
5661699 there is a feeling that it was very selfish of him to pursue the presidency knowing that this skeleton was in his closet
5661700 the democratic party would be in a very tough position now if john edwards was our nominee
5661701 is he really devoted to the issues of regular people
5661702 is he still the millworkers son or has he been captured by the fruits of his wealth
5661703 the fundamental problem with the n amp o and edwards relationship was edwards thought his hometown paper should be supportive of his candidacy

5661713 encouraged and appealed to the parties to sign any outstanding agreements and conclude the negotiations as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5661714 recognised that while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament soon to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on 29 march 2008
5661715 we set out to unseat president mugabe in the elections and we failed that is the reality we will certainly try and unseat him in the next election but as things stand right now tsvangirais demands are unacceptable and we should not tolerate them
5661716 our first prize is that there should be a tripartite agreement involving all three parties
5661717 summit should appeal to anyone who does not want to sign it to reconsider we need parliament to sit in short we want a clear signal from summit that the present situation is untenable
5661718 told tsvangirai that he could deliver on his election promises as a member of cabinet
5661719 it is our expectation as zanu pf that a deal will be concluded in the fullness of time so that we can put behind us the divisions conflict the polarisation that in fact has divided our country
5661720 facing imminent impeachment charges musharraf announced his resignation on monday after months of belated recognition by american officials that he had become a waning asset in the campaign against terrorism the decision removes from pakistans political stage the leader who for nearly nine years served as one of the united states most important and ultimately unreliable allies and it now leaves american officials to deal with a new elected coalition that has so far proved itself to be unwilling or unable to confront an expanding taliban insurgency determined to topple the government

5661727 as a footballer i have become much bigger my passing has improved and i have learned the value of the training ground but the most important thing is that i settled down off the pitch

5661733 there is still no sign of a withdrawal nothing at all
5661734 the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire
5661735 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5661736 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5661737 its true that there is no specific law but they torturers could be charged for voluntary blows and injuries
5661738 the culprits are being investigated but this type of case takes time
5661739 we dont have statistics for previous years but there were definitely hundreds of cases of torture in 2004 and 2005 before the number started to decline in 2006
5661740 well done steve you have successfully taken on the closed minded authoritarian bureaucrats of the auckland city council and won
5661741 a free society is incompatible with censorship even the most offensive literature should be free to be sold to new zealand adults
5661742 libertarianz would defend to the death the right of people like steve crow to present their ideas no matter how controversial the public of new zealand are not so morally weak that they need state protection from impure thoughts books or parades freedom of speech means the right to offend
5661743 doesnt need to be extremely reptilian only more reptilian than his opponent is
5661744 have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil
5661745 the party that starts looking for implausible and unprovable conspiracy theories about the opposition candidate is in trouble
5661746 the reality is that enterprises are not frustrated with tape many of its inherent challenges have been addressed through more intelligent automated tape library systems
5661747 they cannot back up all the critical corporate data they need to with tape alone because there is more data to back up than ever before there is less planned downtime during which to complete backups and application owners want more frequent backups and faster restores
5661748 in a society where you cannot even buy cassette tapes any more as they are unreliable and known for getting chewed up in machines why are businesses still using tapes to back up their data automated online backup means there is no need to physically move the data offsite which the business is charged to have removed and to bring back
5661749 there is an attachment with tape which is why it will never die
5661750 it is selling more tapes than it has in a while and therefore is investing in developments around tape
5661751 switching to online backup means that the data does not have to be physically moved however it disregards the telecommunication charge it costs companies to virtually transport the data as with anything in it it is a trade off
5661752 tape still has its place even though other technologies are becoming more prevalent
5661753 the role of tape is changing and companies are increasingly looking to take advantage of the newer disk based technologies such as virtual tape libraries vtl and de duplication
5661754 tape being dead has to be one of the most commonly heard untruths in the market there are always claims that new technologies will eliminate tape from the it market and frankly this is not the case
5661755 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
5661756 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls
5661757 battery life is not helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing
5661758 but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring

5661760 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5661761 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5661762 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5661763 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5661764 i think there is a lot we have in common with the speaker on renewables on alternative energy and conservation efforts
5661765 if she pelosi is willing to work a compromise in the open then i think everyone here will be happy
5661766 we know that there is not just one magic bullet
5661767 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf ocs for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5661768 a responsible domestic drilling program means an end to royalty holidays that deprive taxpayers of the royalties they deserve an end to subsidies for profit rich oil companies and a requirement that big oil drill the oil leases they already own
5661769 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
5661770 if its a matter of crafting something in her back room and hoping the nation will just come along with her thats just inadmissible
5661771 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5661772 if pelosi was serious about boosting domestic oil supplies she would call the house back into session to take up such a bill
5661773 but the devil is in the details we urge them to fully lift the moratorium any energy plan that fails to fully lift the moratorium represents a missed opportunity to energy supplies we are opposed to any new taxes on the industry and increase on royalties on federal leases and production
5661774 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
5661775 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
5661776 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5661777 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5661778 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5661779 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5661780 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place
5661781 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5661782 the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone
5661783 obviously looking at it in hindsight we would do things differently today
5661784 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned
5661785 in hindsight it would have been useful to have saved it
5661786 the anthrax probe helped to found the field of bioforensics
5661787 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5661788 never mind that thomas already had been confirmed by the senate to three different positions including the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit the second most prestigious court in the land after the u s supreme court before he was nominated to the supreme court
5661789 never mind that he had accomplished all this after overcoming more personal adversity than any other sitting justice has endured sen obamas comment simply ignored facts and history
5661790 they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
5661791 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
5661792 ill tell you why hes the only justice on the supreme court who prior to his appointment had recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
5661793 his is a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person you know in conversation individually
5661794 not only is this attractive from a cash flow point of view but this approach means the malton now has a consistent and predictable cost for it for at least the next three years this brings the business some comfort in uncertain times
5661795 we liked this approach because it meant everything was paid for out of operating expenditure the idea of investing in lots of hardware which depreciates very quickly was not appealing to us most importantly we have been extremely happy with the performance and support of the system since it went live
5661796 we are able to charge for everything required for the hosted service as one recurring fee because we had already made the investment in the virtualised real estate inside the blanchardstown data centre the malton is effectively renting virtual plots on this infrastructure while gaining all of the benefits of the data centre
5661797 the value that novosco brings is our unique understanding of application delivery the days of private companies having to worry about such things are hopefully coming to an end
5661798 the challenge laid out for ibms clients is to treat their most valuable asset their people as their most competitive edge
5661799 represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
5661800 less is more really it is microsoft went completely in the wrong direction with vista
5661801 i personally think that if you want a real hit on your hands strip down the vista os to bare bones optimise the heck out of the code and tune the baby for speed
5661802 for someone who provides tech support the registry is a nightmare applications not showing up as installed applications not showing up as un installed and sloppy installation programs causing system instability due to a deleted registry key
5661803 such a distributed and highly mobile team as cityjets would make it difficult to keep in touch with staff

5661812 new equipment that meets ustranscoms military requirements will help to create a new class of automatic identification technology ait products within the military

5661820 we create this list each year as a reminder of the rapidly changing frame of reference for each new generation entering college the mindset of these students is quite different than the faculty who are about to prepare them to become the leaders of tomorrow
5661821 as the list changes each year so does our means of distributing it were pleased that this year represents our first webcast using mediasite
5661822 the list is terrific for a chuckle terrific if you have a mildly masochistic need to feel old and its terrific in giving you a snapshot of whats happened in the last 18 years
5661823 its also a nice snapshot of the attitudes and events of entering college students
5661824 this webcast was a distinctive partnership for sonic foundry because like beloit college we too follow the evolution of student expectations
5661825 sonic foundry is on the cutting edge of creating technology for blended learning empowering schools to meet those expectations were pleased to partner with beloit college to single out the distinguishing characteristics of todays college students

5661851 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5661852 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5661853 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5661854 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5661855 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5661856 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention

5661911 there are some places where the russians are not interacting at all where they are aggressive touchy almost ready to engage in a firefight with the georgians and there are other places where on the contrary they appear quite friendly
5661912 i was in the small georgian town of kaspi where there were several places in the town where the russians had taken up positions with tanks and armored personnel carriers and their soldiers were wandering around freely now some of them were ossetian as well and they were interacting quite happily with the local population chatting with them discussing the issues discussing whether it was right for them to be there at all in the first place
5661913 the growing suspicion is that ethnic cleansing is still going on and on august 17 i met a french correspondent who had been in the area of akol gori which is part of georgia proper northwest of tbilisi by about 35 kilometers and just a few kilometers from the south ossetian border and which is the new point or relocation for russian troops
5661914 and there were hundreds of ossetian irregulars marauding through georgian villages there
5661915 there are stories of murders rapes burning of houses thefts of property driving off of cattle and kidnapping
5661916 human rights watch which is the only independent human rights organization so far to get into the area has confirmed many of those reports
5661917 we saw those people working in the city cleaning up debris after the bombings we were told by representatives of the authorities unofficially that those people were indeed detained and that they were hauling debris in the city voluntarily
5661918 understandably we were not able to speak to any of those people to our regret
5661919 but i think it is very important today to clarify their status whether they are detained civilians or prisoners of war

5661923 he abandoned his original concept of development when he found that if he sold fill he could very quickly make a lot of money
5661924 there are large pieces of land in contention now he supposedly is developing them as part of mahogany estates
5661925 what we need to accomplish at this meeting is to see that the whole thing is not passed by default and that he is not allowed to develop
5661926 the plans are to level the parcel which is approx 44 acres from its current height of between 20 feet and 30 feet above sea level to 10 feet above the mean sea level which means five feet above ground level
5661927 work of this scale would be surely be considered commercial and not residential
5661928 he has planning permission to put in roads and subdivisions no one is disputing that but he has violated his permission and any promises to consult with people
5661929 we are hoping that this mornings gathering by making everyone aware of what is going on will stop him in his tracks
5661930 the work carried out before the 2000 reinforcement left some of the lots sold inaccessible by road to the owners because the level of the land was excavated below the level of the roadway these lots are still inaccessible
5661931 the area has been quarried by the developer over the years there have been numerous explosions which have caused extensive damage to some properties closer to the development residents close to the blasting area were not warned or notified over the past several years there has been very heavy traffic in and out of the roads all day and night
5661932 is before the board for a commercial quarry this is an amendment to the permission they already had to remove material this is for additional material

5661941 i say to them to come down come down and see our programme come down and see our testing and see how we operate come down anytime day or night we have nothing to hide
5661942 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
5661943 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
5661944 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
5661945 it feels good to be here to be part of history
5661946 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
5661947 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was just a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
5661948 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
5661949 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time

5661953 we expect that civil society government organisations and national human rights institutions will be stronger because of participating in this project
5661954 the fact of the matter is you can opt out of it but the project is there the funding is there the expertise is there and the support is there
5661955 an exciting project and there is a lot to be gained from it depending on where you are
5661956 its just a matter of choosing what activities you want to engage with and letting us know that so we can go ahead and tailor make the project

5661960 i challenged him on it and asked him why we didnt have prayer
5661961 he said as long as he was mayor here it wasnt going to happen
5661962 i would suggest were not really stopping prayer were just having a different kind of opportunity for prayer
5661963 i think its time to do something as citizens if all these people are leaving because they want prayer we need prayer
5661964 our agenda said a moment of silence and thats fine but dont make all the decisions yourself
5661965 were supposed to be a team and we want to work as a team not a dictatorship
5661966 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5661967 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5661968 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5661969 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5661970 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5661971 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5661972 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5661973 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5661974 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power

5661988 before my fight i went to see the medical doctor to give me a pain killer and a muscle relaxer called methotarbeamol because my knee was soar stiff and was inflated with liquid from my previous injury and from the training
5661989 the medical doctor then went to get permission from the head table in which permission was granted to give me the pain killer he then preceded with a shot to my bottom rare which was very painful and lasted for awhile luckily i had to wait for a while before my fight he then proceeded with ice and constantly rubbed to help lubricate my joints followed by knee raps
5661990 i was very tired by then but i know if i was tired then he was tired also

5661992 the company explained that their prices are based on the cost of the product in the international market which has been rising since the beginning of the year influenced by several factors such as the weakness of the us dollar and fundamental factors that impact the balance of supply and demand of crude oil making product prices reach record levels this year but this is a global phenomenon not only impacting the cayman islands
5661993 another important factor that influences pricing is competition chevron aims at providing a competitive price to our customers at all times and this is the advantage of a free market
5661994 although the company understands and it is sensitive to the governments concern over the high fuel prices regulation is not the best way to address the matter since it will not allow market forces to work in favour of the consumer
5661995 chevron specified that prices are posted at all texaco service stations so consumers can have information that allows them to make their decision on where to purchase gas that makes competition react getting the market working for the consumer
5661996 governments shouldnt introduce sudden changes in the regulatory framework aiming to offset potential short term problems like volatile pricing it is evident from comparing regulated oil markets with free markets that consumers are best served by allowing market forces to determine fuel prices
5661997 while this initiative is also a step in a positive direction persons may consider car pooling and doing other things to ensure that they are able to finance themselves adequately

5662212 in an environment where dollars are tight and gas is 4 a gallon consumers derive great satisfaction from services that dont require them to spend money or get in their car

5662217 yo que creo que s la lucha estar entre jap n y china por el tercer puesto porque a las rusas les est n puntuando muy bien
5662218 para lograr la medalla hay que nadar para conseguir la medalla y hay que hacerlo bien es muy real y muy posible pero hay que hacerlo todo apunta a que s pero no hay que asegurar nada
5662219 a las rusas les toca el oro se lo merecen por su regularidad por su trabajo por todo nosotras hemos mejorado much simo pero siempre ellas han estado arriba y siempre hemos querido acercarnos a ellas es l gico que ellas se merezcan el oro
5662220 las rusas cada vez nos miran m s de cerca nos tienen miedo el primer d a ni nos miraban a la cara y ya nos saludan ahora que ya saben que son primeras
5662221 a la reina le ha gustado dice que hay mucha diferencia entre los malos y los buenos
5662222 a veces se te escapa alguna sonrisa que no toca pero yo creo que le dan m s importancia a la t cnica y a la sincronizaci n que a la expresi n
5662223 nos cuesta llegar al final porque hay siete apneas en total quiz s sea el ejercicio m s ca ero en ese aspecto porque hay muchos movimientos de piernas
5662224 lo suyo es peor as que m s te vale hacerlo bien
5662225 m s contentas que el lunes dicen que en principio ha salido mejor pero bueno hemos luchado eso es lo que contaba ha habido un 9 7 del juez chino que era de esperar as que no pasa nada

5662231 we konden berekenen dat een derde van de ziektes opgelopen op de werkplek te maken hebben met blootstelling aan chemische stoffen het is enorm we spreken over kankers huidziekten ademhalingsproblemen daarvan is een klein deel te wijten aan de reprotoxines precieze cijfers hebben we niet
5662232 people are looking for a reason to get off the fence the most asked question in america today other than who obamas vice president is going to be is probably when is the bottom and if you even smell as though you are in real estate people ask you that question all day long
5662233 with respect to traffic its still dismal traffic is its consistent however it has not gotten any worse for the last three quarters so we feel as though weve stabilized but i dont want to give you the indication that that makes us feel good its as though we walked into the tar pits sunk up to our nose our feet are touching a ledge and we are not going down any further but that sure doesnt make us feel that comfortable but we are heartened that at least we are able to spook up the traffic that indicates that there are buyers out there waiting to be nudged it will take a general turn in confidence for the big nudge to occur but sooner or later it will occur
5662234 we see the same competitive situation in general as we have seen in the past two and three quarters years and the reason is that as these smaller builders are failing or as our larger builders are looking for cash flow more seriously we run into even more competition perhaps than we had before so until a guy has gone out of business he continues to offer more and more competition so i wouldnt say the competitive situation has eased up
5662235 people have been out of the market for two and three quarter years they have accumulated decent wealth they want to move and thats generally how these markets finally correct its not some cataclysmic effect other than in the 74 or 75 time when congress passed a fairly significant bill for housing generally these markets work themselves out and the pent up demand just swells until it finally goes over the top of the dam when it first goes over the top of the dam you dont get a lot of water you get a little water and then a little more and a little more and a little more and i think thats what we are seeing
5662236 it is time for the land to be disgorged by the financial institutions and thats beginning
5662237 i think this is going to be if not the bottom of the trough approaching the bottom there are some straws in the wind preliminary signs that housing is turning around in some parts of the country
5662238 this is a republican administration i assume you are a republican do you feel strange preaching regulation

5662247 but its just standing there i could catch that one
5662248 its naive when people think that youre going to have a couple of politicians get together and solve the conflict in the middle east
5662249 its more than naive theres a level of arrogance there
5662250 my belief does not influence my views on foreign policy but at the same time it has clearly given me perspective on the depth of the history of the middle east if youve studied the bible you certainly understand this conflict didnt start in the 1940s it started with isaac and ishmael
5662251 huckabee is a straight shooter and he speaks with one voice
5662252 i dont think you can really determine whether huckabee had less success with the jewish vote

5662260 its important for people to stay calm use common sense and stay safe stay off the roads if you dont need to travel and remain in touch
5662261 everything is working right with our emergency management said the governor who declared a state of emergency on saturday
5662262 we have the best trained team serving florida it makes me happier than you know
5662263 we do have some bands feeding into the storm from the south linker said
5662264 it will be these bands rotating into the storm and breaking off that could impact the bay area
5662265 we could see some tropical storm conditions from these bands
5662266 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5662267 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5662268 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5662269 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5662270 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5662271 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5662272 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5662273 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5662274 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5662275 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5662276 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5662277 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5662278 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5662279 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5662280 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5662281 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade

5662289 negative ageist stereotypes often disappear when different generations come together and learn to understand and appreciate each other
5662290 breaking down barriers in this way undoubtedly lays the ground for building stronger communities
5662291 esta acci n solo beneficia al empresario y va en detrimento de las arcas municipales
5662292 la carambola sortea dos sentencias que declararon ilegal la urbanizaci n del centro comercial y es una acci n de poca trasparencia ya que se ha realizado con excesiva celeridad y una vez que hemos estudiado el asunto despu s de lo publicado y declaraciones aparecidas en prensa entendemos que el ayuntamiento ha dejado de ser garante del patrimonio p blico tanto monetario como territorial
5662293 la empresa promociones horneras y jinur firmaron un acuerdo entre otros muchos con la administraci n auton mica en el a o 1998 por el que la empresa financiaba las obras de urbanizaci n por importe de 3 000 millones de pesetas la aprobaci n de la junta de gobierno viene a maquillar la realidad porque entendemos que la acci n de gobierno es lesiva al patrimonio p blico y a los intereses ciudadanos
5662294 lamentamos mucho la actitud del psoe que se ha plegado a las demandas empresariales y de su otro socio pol tico porque en definitiva no entendemos el cambio de actitud cuando en el a o 2001 el psoe manifestaba que el pmj era una ilegalidad manifiesta abril 2001 o cuando en marzo del a o 2003 present en el parlamento de canarias una moci n interpelando al gobierno sobre el pmj como colectivo ecologista no entendemos la actitud del concejal de urbanismo que quiere resolver este asunto por la v a de los hechos consumados
5662295 toda la colaboraci n para que el tema se reconduzca y se aclaren cuestiones como por ejemplo va a quedar el incumplimiento de la ley de costas o la infracci n urban stica por la invasi n de 20 000 metros cuadrados de playa o el amojonamiento de los lindes municipales o los yacimientos arqueol gicos d nde est el dinero de la monetarizaci n de parcelas que se firm en su momento por los t cnicos municipales o el exceso de alturas de parte del edificio principal del centro comercial son muchas las dudas y pocas las respuestas a tan grave cuesti n

5662298 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5662299 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5662300 while we are still monitoring the situation and it is probably a little early we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5662301 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
5662302 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
5662303 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5662304 while we are still monitoring the situation and it is probably a little early we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5662305 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
5662306 the improvement in the forward looking sentiment in august at one level implies that the 20pc fall in oil prices since mid july combined with the downward correction in the euro against the dollar is helping to reduce the perception of downside economic risks early next year
5662307 still a single monthly rebound does not make a trend and it remains to be seen whether this improvement in the headline zew index is sustained in coming months
5662308 this signals that a large part of the economic weakness that was recorded in q2 was seen as carrying through in q3 in our view
5662309 weve got a reserve game and im interested to see him playing we may have another one in on trial
5662310 if its true its not new and if its new its not true

5662314 were nowhere near that stage and were not going to jeopardize anything
5662315 were just going to do the work and hopefully when everything has been put together and negotiations are over there will be further announcements
5662316 theyre sitting at the table with us because they understand our commitment to the industry
5662317 theyre here because it makes good business sense to be here
5662318 its hard to tell at this early stage were just doing some preliminary work to see what resumes are out there what sort of database we can get and the amount of people that are available for jobs
5662319 its a help even if we just got the ground itself done
5662320 im not sure if it needs to be sodded or seeded or whatever but there certainly needs to be some work done on the field itll probably get our fencing up and our backstop up itll give us a good start
5662321 when i was back in school we used to use this for softball teams one time there was a playground in front of it
5662322 were looking to get it restored to get a place for kids to play and get them off the streets theres a lot of young people here with nothing to do
5662323 it gives the kids around here something else to do because in a small community theres no hangouts there is nowhere for them to go
5662324 at least when you got a few sports events they can kind of get together themselves as a group and just go play it does take them off the street and it does give them something to do
5662325 right now were in the process of doing maintenance on our walking trail
5662326 every year you got to replace so much boards were probably going to spend about 5 000 on that but we wouldnt be able to do it without the help of government
5662327 we have some very strong athletes here in basketball and volleyball
5662328 we want the consumer to know that this exists and we want tourists to know so that when they come and visit they can have local flavour
5662329 we want them to experience the local produce local baked goods
5662330 id rather if they were picked yesterday compared to picked three weeks ago and put in a truck
5662331 it takes a little initiative around here there are several plots of land that were used for farming now theyre just bare someone with the right initiative and the will they can definitely get some land
5662332 it depends on the size of the operation also how big of an operation do they have maybe they should consider expanding somewhat expanding their product line
5662333 it takes a few years to develop and get more space but you know i think there definitely would be a market
5662334 the fact of the matter is we would love to put local on but we have no local guys coming here saying why dont you buy our stuff
5662335 not one in six years has come through the doors and said look what ive got to sell you
5662336 im tired of chasing people yeah i want to promote your product but here i am usually if you have a product you have to sell it you cant have people chasing you all the time for it at one point you kind of get tired
5662337 people have been told they can only grow cabbage turnip and potatoes
5662338 nobody really tried anything different the first year that we grew corn we had people coming who had never seen corn grow before
5662339 its really hard to get anywhere with the department of agriculture
5662340 its hard to do anything with them i dont think they have a lot of faith in the ability of people to grow things like when i first started with the grapes i was told forget it they will not grow here and now theyre here and theyre here year after year and i get a beautiful crop
5662341 the only one i supplied was alex because he starts with fresh ingredients
5662342 the others they dont not that im aware of if there were more restaurants demanding that i would definitely do it
5662343 i had some tourists who said oh you actually do grow produce in newfoundland and labrador
5662344 every restaurant they went to they had frozen vegetables there they werent very pleased with it
5662345 the elderly people have grown up with carrots potatoes turnips and of course onions and thats what theyre used to and then their kids unless theyve tried them dont have much interest in it
5662346 most of what i grow is the old fashioned stuff
5662347 thats the biggest demand i got the market is not big enough
5662348 when you go in and taste a tomato in a store it tastes disgusting and then you taste a tomato that youve grown and its just phenomenal
5662349 it has to be education when i was growing lettuce my lettuce were big and green and i had several people tell me thats not what lettuce is supposed to look like because they had seen these little white things in the store and they told me what i was growing wasnt right

5662385 with the passage of crucial housing legislation last month that created an attractive home buyer tax credit there is a sense that home sales may soon be reaching a turning point
5662386 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market
5662387 while our overall measure of builder confidence remains at a record low at this time it is a good sign that two out of three of the hmis component indexes rose in august and this may be an indication that we are nearing the bottom of the long downswing in new home sales
5662388 our current forecast shows stabilization of sales during the second half of this year followed by solid recovery in 2009 and beyond

5662486 its right up there with worst ideas in the history of modern education

5662502 with the schools the council has decided it is going to try to run a service weve raised concerns about health and safety with the likes of janitors and catering staff off but obviously the decision is entirely up to the council
5662503 when a strike is announced the council normally say no new annual leave applications are allowed but this time they extended that period
5662504 we hope people will understand this is not an unofficial public holiday and have reminded members it would undermine the campaign
5662505 any increase in the pay award would raise that gap even further and tough decisions will have to be taken about service delivery within the council
5662506 we are not in the position to speculate on the outcome of the investigation but after several incidents like these it would be appropriate for apple to take some measures to raise the publics awareness

5662588 ive always been very much into fitness and exercise and i began taking it quite seriously about 15 years ago attending fitness conventions and teaching classes at whitehaven sports centre
5662589 it was time to look for something new to work for myself in something i was passionate about
5662590 as it happened my mother in law saw an advert for a rosemary conley franchise i did my research and attended a number of presentations and i was very impressed by the setup and the level of support they offer is outstanding
5662591 so i purchased my license and will launch under the umbrella of the rosemary conley organisation on september 1
5662592 the sessions will be structured in keeping with the rosemary conley format it is not a one fit for all format as the sessions are adapted to each persons ability and goals
5662593 each person undergoes a detailed screening before joining and the 90 minute sessions consist of weigh ins personal consultations a motivational talk weight maintenance programme and 45 minutes of exercise to music
5662594 everyone and anyone should have the ability to do it the class is split into three tiers and people place themselves in which category they feel is appropriate and they can change depending on how they progress
5662595 people can try the session before they become members too and then decide to sign up for as many sessions as they wish
5662596 i have an ocr level 2 in exercise to music but i am currently working towards a qualification in nutrition which i can take to degree level in the future this is important because the issues surrounding nutrition are ever changing
5662597 i have to thank my mum margaret proud and my mother in law christine telfer for their help and support and i wouldnt be able to do this without them
5662598 if you are thinking of losing weight or getting fitter and you feel confident enough to do something about it this is a friendly and supportive way to do it and works well for the individual its a simple formula of looking at what you are eating and doing

5662604 holds out hope of not only expanding the supply of potential teachers but improving their quality as well
5662605 the current system attempts to ensure teacher quality by requiring teachers to earn certification from a teachers college and encouraging them to earn advanced degrees there unfortunately there is ample evidence that what teachers learn in education schools does not make them more effective in the classroom research consistently finds that teachers with advanced degrees perform no better than those without them and that few if any benefits come from earning certification
5662606 for instance the university of washingtons dan goldhaber and his colleagues found that length of experience and number of degrees earned the two factors that determine a teachers salary explain only about 3 percent of the variation in a teachers effect on student achievement
5662607 the current certification system is probably keeping out many college graduates who have the potential to be talented teachers
5662608 evidence from existing alternative certification programs which invariably involve some combination of training and supervised practice has been relatively positive for example studies by mathematica and the urban institute have found that teachers participating in the teach for america program which recruits graduates of prestigious colleges and universities to teach in struggling schools are better at raising student scores than graduates of teachers colleges it remains to be seen whether expansion of alternative certification programs beyond a small group of elite schools will find large numbers of promising motivated candidates but their success thus far is impressive enough to warrant it

5662688 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5662689 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5662690 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5662691 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5662692 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and to weaken the georgian state

5662702 you can rear them in the lab with a small amount of antibiotics and grow big numbers then when you release them theres no wild antibiotics so the genes are turned on and they become sterile
5662703 production and distribution of human vaccines is an extraordinarily expensive process and the time investment from concept to commercial production can be as much as 10 years
5662704 there arent enough people getting sick to make it worthwhile to a company to develop a vaccine
5662705 the pharmaceutical people have been using this method for years to design drugs but its just now that the mosquito people are getting into it too

5662717 you know were pretty used to it now but its definitely like putting the pads on in football or anything like that it definitely changes up here points to head when we put it on
5662718 aside from injuries and stuff the normal things that plague any team yeah weve only gotten better especially as far as musicianship and playing together as a band

5662726 vor dem hintergrund der erfolgreichen entwicklung im 2 quartal sind wir trotz des konjunkturellen gegenwindes und des nachhaltigen kursverfalls von us dollar und britischem pfund zuversichtlich die f r 2008 geplante umsatz und ergebnissteigerung von rund 15 prozent erreichen zu k nnen

5662734 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5662735 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5662736 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters
5662737 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart

5662739 yes and no of course i didnt like it but i expected him to do it and i probably would have done something similar but yes i am very very very disappointed
5662740 i picked rasmus because he was the only one who could beat me
5662741 not really thats what sports about you have to do what you have to do

5662753 allein durch stromeinsparungen und die bessere nutzung von w rme und k lte reduzieren wir die co2 emmission um 18 000 tonnen pro jahr
5662754 f r unternehmen ist wichtig dass sie ma geschneiderte l sungen aufgezeigt bekommen
5662755 sap bietet hinsichtlich der vertragsgestaltung viele m glichkeiten um diese auf den individuellen bedarf abzustimmen brauchen die kunden von sap aber einen partner mit ausgiebigem sap lizenz know how so kann ein einsparpotenzial zwischen 15 und 20 prozent in bezug auf lizenzen und wartung freigesetzt werden
5662756 gerade mittelst ndische unternehmen haben wenig zeit und gelegenheit sich mit den details der sap vertragswerke vertraut zu machen daher nehmen sie den text der sap preisliste als gegeben hin
5662757 dabei verkennen sie den verhandlungsspielraum f r individuell angepasste l sungen der auch bei sap durchaus gegeben ist wir helfen diese einsparpotenziale zu erkennen und durch unterst tzung bei den verhandlungen freizusetzen
5662758 die rasanten nderungen in den unternehmensstrukturen der konzerne durch zukauf und abspaltungen f hren zu vollkommen un bersichtlichen lizenzstrukturen hohe folgekosten durch wartungskosten sind dann unausweichlich hier kann nur durch transparenz das brachliegende einsparpotenzial freigesetzt werden
5662759 entscheidende voraussetzung ist allerdings dass die arbeitslosen menschen sich freiwillig daf r entscheiden k nnen
5662760 m ssen die tr ger der einrichtungen diese zus tzlichen aufgaben definieren k nnen

5662764 there is a time for putting together and another time for taking apart
5662765 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5662766 the dollars recent rise was driven mainly by falls in oil prices
5662767 but because the majority view is that there is more room for falls in oil prices the dollars current fall is only a correction and its expected to resume rising again
5662768 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road
5662769 but because interest rate differentials between countries are not a trading factor right now such speculation would have little impact
5662770 i played a festival recently i put up a peace sign and got the crowd to put up a peace sign it was written in the music press that my asking people to put up a peace sign was a crassism
5662771 now if its a crassism to ask people to put up a peace sign at a time when were at war in two countries were shafted and therefore im going to retire from the music industry in january because im disgusted by it i dont want nothing to do with it no more
5662772 im going to retire from the music industry because its run by rich white men who are very conservative and have been around too long they dont wanna hear anybody with anything truly rebellious to say and thats why british indie music has stalled for the last ten years

5662790 he had a pro bowl season four or five seasons ago in minnesota so he has that kind of talent but when youre standing behind larry johnson in kansas city and you come in here late in midseason its hard to get an opportunity
5662791 i think hes established himself once again as a very fine football player hes picking up the passing game hes just become a better well rounded football player and were excited about him obviously
5662792 im coming from a totally different offense that ive been in for the last seven years and to come into the big mighty west coast offense it was a big challenge
5662793 by me being here during the offseason week in and week out being with my coach doing some off the field work and learning what i needed to learn to bring into training camp that helped
5662794 michael bennett is a pro bowl running back that isnt lost on anybody
5662795 hes one of the most talented backs we have he has talent speed and power he does everything well and hes really come along with the offense nothing hes doing is a surprise
5662796 how do you not play a guy like michael bennett were all very different hes the type of guy that if you give a crease he can take it to the house im happy with what our backfield looks like we can pose a lot of problems for a lot of people
5662797 each and every week i want to come out and put on a little performance and give the coaches something to evaluate me on for the most part its going well
5662798 the progress has been smooth and all the four bases will be completed by the year end

5662864 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5662865 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5662866 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5662876 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5662882 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

5662956 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5662957 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5662963 i become a senior groupie i really liked those guys
5662964 business wise its like renting space on an empty 18 wheeler after youve dropped off your delivery the advantage to flying a charter is you dont wait in line and at many small airports limousines can drive up to the airplane
5662965 the plane i fly holds 4 500 gallons and jet fuel sells for 7 a gallon on top of that we have about 1 million in fixed costs for the one airplane the faa requires monthly inspections you cant just hang out a shingle and become a charter company
5662966 when you finally get on the plane after waiting in the long line you sit in the center seat for a four hour flight
5662967 the kid in back of you is kicking your seat you get a 5 box of snacks you wouldnt eat if it was free
5662968 and who is sitting next to you you have a discussion with a business associate but you never know who is listening in on the conversation
5662969 there are three groups of people that fly on our aircraft
5662970 you have your high net worth individuals you have the people in the sports and entertainment industry and you have your corporate executives and political figures
5662971 youll never look at commercial flying in quite the same way youll never want to go back to ohare
5662972 youre able to make two or three stops in different cities in one day
5662973 on one of our flights you can get surf and turf sushi shrimp and champagne there is no boundary if you have the means
5662974 ought be there alive and kicking and diligent at clear up

5662978 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5662979 they told me there are going to be resources here
5662980 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5662981 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5662982 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5662983 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5662984 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5662985 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5662986 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5662987 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5662988 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5662989 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5662990 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5662991 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5662992 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5662993 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5662994 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5662995 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5662996 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5662997 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5662998 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5662999 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5663000 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5663001 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5663002 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5663003 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5663004 i am pleased to endorse my friend bob tuke to be the next u
5663005 but bob is more than a candidate with timely solutions to pressing problems facing our nation and our planet he is also a man of great honor and integrity bob has the life experience that we need to turn our country around as a marine combat veteran in vietnam bob led troops in battle the u s senate would be well served to have his perspective as we finally bring an end to the mismanaged war in iraq these are just a few of the reasons that i am proud to give him my full support and endorsement
5663006 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5663007 there are nuclear weapons materials in more than 40 countries some secured by nothing more than a chain link fence and at the current pace it will be decades before this material is adequately secured
5663008 the worlds second largest muslim nation could become a failed state with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and a population larger than those of iran iraq afghanistan and north korea combined
5663009 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5663010 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5663011 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5663012 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5663013 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
5663014 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
5663015 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
5663016 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
5663017 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command

5663042 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5663043 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less

5663045 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5663046 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources

5663058 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5663059 kami berpendapat kes ini tiada kewajaran untuk didengar sebab tiada empat saksi dan ia juga hanya harus didengar di mahkamah syariah
5663060 pada asasnya islam meletakkan peraturan yang jelas bagi memungkinkan keadilan dicapai melalui proses kehakiman dan pembuktian terlebih dahulu sebelum sebarang sumpah dilafazkan
5663061 proses pembuktian dan pengadilan akan diketepikan dan pihak yang bersalah boleh memilih untuk menggunakan sumpah bagi menyelamatkan diri daripada hukuman
5663062 dalam syariat islam kes ini diklasifikasikan sebagai kes hudud dan pendakwa wajar membawa bukti mengikut syarak bahawa perlakuan liwat berlaku dan perkara ini akan dibicarakan di mahkamah selaras kaedah feqah dan pihak pendakwa perlu mengemukakan bukti empat orang saksi manakala yang menafikan dikehendaki bersumpah
5663063 there should be stringent laws licensing laws to make sure produce is only used in season

5663070 i found that the employee usage reports generated by websense were extremely difficult to read and even more so to explain to a supervisor whose employees job was potentially on the line we werent able to accurately tell the difference between a website that had been intentionally visited by an employee and a popup ad when youre dealing with a persons career you need to be 100 sure your reports are accurate we just didnt feel we had that
5663071 it was great to just plug the hardware into our network rack turn it on and be done with it the cymphonix setup took maybe 20 minutes and we were able to go home immediately after we shut down our websense
5663072 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the u s and the global economy
5663073 but declining customer satisfaction combined with weaker demand for u s exports may make it difficult for american households to shoulder the burden of being the locomotive for world economic growth
5663074 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts
5663075 this is not going to be helpful as the big three will lose more pricing power and be forced to continue dependence on rebates and discounting in a market where consumer preferences keep shifting away from domestic cars
5663076 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5663077 from the beginning janet my wife dana and i have shared the vision of creating extraordinary wine from our special property on pritchard hill in the napa valley janets deep and thorough knowledge along with her ability to confront the myriad challenges we faced was instrumental in turning that vision into reality

5663086 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5663087 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5663088 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5663089 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5663090 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it

5663105 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale

5663139 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5663140 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5663141 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5663142 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5663143 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5663144 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5663145 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5663146 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5663147 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5663148 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5663149 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5663150 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5663151 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5663152 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5663153 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5663154 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5663155 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5663156 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5663157 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5663158 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5663159 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5663160 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5663161 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5663162 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5663163 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5663164 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5663165 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5663166 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5663167 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5663168 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5663169 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5663170 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5663171 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5663172 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5663173 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5663174 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5663175 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5663176 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5663177 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5663178 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5663179 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5663180 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5663181 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5663182 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5663183 get it off the air and i really mean it
5663184 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5663185 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5663186 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5663187 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5663188 i am married to the next president of the united states
5663189 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5663190 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5663191 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5663192 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5663193 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5663194 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5663195 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5663196 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5663197 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5663198 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5663199 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5663200 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5663201 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5663202 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5663203 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5663204 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5663205 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5663206 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5663207 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5663208 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5663209 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5663210 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5663211 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5663212 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5663213 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5663214 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5663215 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5663216 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5663217 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5663218 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5663219 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5663220 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5663221 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5663222 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5663223 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5663224 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5663225 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5663226 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5663227 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5663228 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5663229 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5663230 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5663231 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5663232 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5663233 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5663234 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5663235 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5663236 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5663237 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5663238 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5663239 perverts arrested and hung out to dry from flds compound
5663240 as the community continued to evolve leadership winston salem fell behind in terms of understanding those market forces and how the community had changed
5663241 the community is a lot more diverse today than it was 25 years ago
5663242 and leadership isnt as centric as it was its much more dispersed we dont have the same corporate structure here any longer
5663243 in a setting that is not typical of all of our regular business interactions
5663244 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5663245 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5663246 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5663247 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5663248 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5663249 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5663250 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5663251 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know

5663255 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails

5663259 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5663260 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5663261 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5663262 what do you want your look to say to people
5663263 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5663264 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5663265 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5663266 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5663267 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5663268 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5663269 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5663270 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5663271 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5663272 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5663273 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5663274 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5663275 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5663276 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5663277 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5663278 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5663279 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5663280 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5663281 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short

5663293 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5663294 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
5663295 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
5663296 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
5663297 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
5663298 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
5663299 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
5663300 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
5663301 an awful lot of my friends didnt come back or didnt come back in the best mental condition i felt that id let them down
5663302 its kind of a tried and true american versus an unknown
5663303 there was never a lot of discussion about the issues we work on and he wasnt working with older communities to get out their vote
5663304 hes pretty much unknown on these issues as a result and has a lot of work to do
5663305 i like change i know a lot of people fear it but how do you move on in an organization or business without it
5663306 when it comes to constitutional law it doesnt matter how i morally think
5663307 if were all protected whether i like it or not is irrelevant
5663308 when i grew up you were a republican or democrat and neither shall be the other now not everything needs to be liberal or conservative youve got an opportunity to actually sit back and think
5663309 i mean come on if youre going to nitpick everyone who wants to be president youre going to run out of everyone and then youll have to come to me
5663310 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5663311 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5663312 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5663313 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5663314 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5663315 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole
5663316 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5663317 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5663318 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5663319 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5663320 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5663321 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5663322 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5663323 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5663324 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5663325 toute l gende est tir e de faits r els
5663326 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5663327 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5663328 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5663329 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5663330 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

5663332 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5663333 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5663334 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5663335 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5663336 billofrights can you not see the irony that you use the phrase
5663337 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
5663338 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
5663339 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
5663340 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
5663341 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
5663342 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
5663343 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
5663344 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
5663345 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5663346 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5663347 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5663348 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5663349 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5663350 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5663351 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5663352 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5663353 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5663354 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5663355 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5663356 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5663357 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5663358 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible

5663360 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5663361 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5663362 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5663363 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5663364 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion

5663366 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5663367 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5663368 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5663369 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5663370 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5663371 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5663372 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5663373 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5663374 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5663375 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5663376 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5663377 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5663378 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5663379 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5663380 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5663381 never frown because you never know who might be falling in love with your smile
5663382 i hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair
5663383 the greatest challenge in life is to find someone who knows all your flaws and differences and yet still willingly embraces you with so much love
5663384 i never believed in love at first sight never believed till i saw you that night
5663385 it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages

5663389 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5663390 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5663391 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5663392 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5663393 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
5663394 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
5663395 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
5663396 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5663397 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions

5663400 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5663401 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5663402 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5663403 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5663404 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5663405 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5663406 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5663407 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5663408 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5663409 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5663410 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it

5663413 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
5663414 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5663415 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5663416 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5663417 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5663418 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5663419 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5663420 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5663421 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5663422 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5663423 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5663445 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5663446 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5663447 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5663448 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans

5663458 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

5663465 if your svp of sales is a boomer and has worked hard to figure out how to manage and reward a team of xers over the years what happens when all the new recruits are gen y
5663466 what happens if you have a boomer svp of marketing but your customer base is heavily weighted with the younger generations can there be a mismatch of preference one might have learned the value of direct mail marketing while the other wants to see a podcast on the 4 inch screen of an i phone the call center team today is made up of a different group of folks than who was jockeying the phones in the 90s do they have different aspirations and expectations that is what i have been led to believe are you managing the call center with what you learned about the function a decade ago and with a whole different generation of workers
5663467 a bank that is renowned as a great place to work told me that an idea to have tellers share via internal blogs customer interactions they found interesting was a non starter
5663468 our partner ecosystem is a critical element of our go to market strategy
5663469 genesys awarded voxify the applications partner of the year and we will work closely with them to bring to market complete offerings that enable our customers to be successful quickly

5663475 we are fast approaching a moment of crucial and perhaps irreversible decision not merely between two kinds of but between two kinds of society
5663476 current developments in applying technology are rendering hollow both the remaining safeguards on privacy and the right to access and correct personal data if these developments continue their enormous surveillance potential will leave individuals lives vulnerable to an unprecedented concentration of scrutiny and authority
5663477 i was just turning this idea over and over in my head and i went through all kinds of solutions i kept riding through it and finally by the time i got there i knew exactly how to do it in an elegant way
5663478 it was really important because it meant that untraceability could be unconditional
5663479 it doesnt matter how much computer power the nsa has to break codes they cant figure it out and you can prove that
5663480 for many years it was very difficult for me to have to work on this sort of subject within the field because people were not at all receptive to it
5663481 and i couldnt understand this it made it all the harder for me to keep pushing on this because my academic advisors were saying oh thats political thats social youre out of line even the department head at berkeley said dont work on this because you can never tell the effects of a new idea on society i acknowledged him in my dissertation saying it was the rethinking and finally the rejection of this principle that caused me to do this work
5663482 people wanted to buy davids patents but he asked for too much he wanted control

5663489 i should think lord rothermere will be more surprised than anyone there is no question that this is an inspired move by global radio
5663490 the industry view was that when he came back he was being groomed for the top
5663491 miron is not a man who makes impetuous decisions he will be a bigger fish in a smaller pond at global radio and he can perhaps be more entrepreneurial and have more scope and influence
5663492 commerical nous is commercial nous and miron is a very very good operator
5663493 he will bring great commercial gravitas to the organisation he is very ambitious and he wouldnt move unless global radios ambitions matched his
5663494 he makes things happen this is fantastic news for radio they have done brilliantly to get him he will pick radio up by the scruff of the neck

5663498 it is not as if it is not going to cause the banks any pain but because theyve been dealing with it for the past few years it wont be as bad as it could have been

5663546 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
5663547 so there could be a very attractive opportunity for medical applications if we can make the system smaller and more portable and combine it with an endoscope to achieve in vivo imaging
5663548 the main challenges in making a portable two photon endoscope are the efficient delivery of both the excitation beam and the nonlinear optical signals achieving flexibility and compactness of the probe and the miniaturisation of its laser scanning mechanisms
5663549 we are currently working to detect individuals at risk of developing cancer before they get their cancer
5663550 the idea is that if patients do progress then we watch them very closely unfortunately there is currently no good way to watch very closely unless you can target your biopsies accurately this technology basically adds that missing link by allowing targeted biopsies
5663551 once weve identified people who may progress to cancer the question is what are we going to do about it the aim would be to offer a prevention strategy incorporating treatment of precancerous lesions to halt progression to cancer as well as offering a test enabling identification of these cancers at an early stage we know that in the stomach doing standard white light endoscopy is not good for diagnosing early or premalignant lesions so thats why this sort of technology is just ideal for diagnosing these conditions

5663595 on the injury front junior wr jared perry did not practice today after suffering a mild shoulder separation in saturdays scrimmage team trainers hope to have him back before the end of the week senior te chase coffman dressed out for the first time since having surgery last tuesday on his broken finger but he did not participate in contact drills and was limited to running routes without catching the ball
5663596 from my novice perspective i thought the no 1 offensive line held up well against the top d line in 1 on 1 pass rush drills especially left tackle elvis fisher against stryker sulak the more i see of fisher the less i think last weeks line shuffle was some sort of panicked shot in the dark move by the staff hes athletic enough to keep his feet moving on the edge and has enough power to outmuscle defensive ends

5663683 for the past several months we have been working closely with neversoft and activision harmonix and konami to ensure that playstation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility
5663684 of course each of these great games have their own specific cool features that may not be compatible with the other controllers but this is our first big step in bringing a level of compatibility to music games that is sure to benefit playstation 3 consumers
5663685 its something that lots of my constituents have called me about

5663688 a neighbour helped me to bury him in our garden and then i just fled
5663689 it gently stimulates the sexual nerve pathways taking the woman to a pre orgasmic plateau where she dangles on the edge of orgasm for as long as she wants
5663690 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
5663691 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
5663692 they now ring the bells but they will soon wring their hands
5663693 cycle 23 which hasnt finished yet looks like it will be long at least 12 to 13 years and cycle 24 which has still to start looks like it will be exceptionally weak
5663694 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
5663695 we have tried everything else and we know it does not work
5663696 that looks like a good place to spread out and grow
5663697 the way i see it buying a piece of land and constructing an algae facility and having a whole staff just to produce the algae will make your cost of production go way up
5663698 we are looking at this as a secondary crop that doesnt take a huge secondary investment for a medium sized operation you can basically use the same staff as you have for the fish operation
5663699 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet

5663706 in the minds of most people you rarely spend money to get nothing done
5663707 but in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
5663708 you put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe
5663709 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that
5663710 maybe they know who their friends are and they have other means of influencing them
5663711 people have absorbed the fact that its a real crisis and it will take complicated solutions to solve

5663728 it may be a seeding study but lets not call it that in our internal documents
5663729 we are doing this because all the counties surrounding us already have ordinances in place and we were becoming a dumping ground
5663730 render the process meaningless and put all protected species at risk
5663731 sam gappmayer has a significant history of achievement in taking the arts organizations he has served to higher ground

5663738 this guy is the greatest athlete in the world and every athlete in the world needs to tip their hats
5663739 is that when they dont feel good they dont swim well michael kind of performs independently of his feelings
5663740 i was already the world record holder i just came here to win

5663749 i think theyre so focused on the campaign they kinda lost the momentum
5663750 a directive order has been issued to the government to provide basic human rights including education and health care to the child
5663751 this means the childs rights cant be violated in the name of culture
5663752 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5663753 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5663754 hip hop wouldnt be what it is without isaac hayes
5663755 you may be proud that not the smallest beam in the slightest crack of space will get in your deflector shield eye booth but you look like a bug on hind legs a bug the stick thin skin and bones body type completes the preying mantis fashion statement
5663756 heres the problem lots of cover up is actually worth covering up you may think that a pimple mount of height x necessitates a layer of foundation of x 1 thickness but really youve managed to expand the problem area to your entire face you dont look like porcelain you look crusty if you cant tan dont manufacture a layer of grainy fakeskin some guys like pale chicks
5663757 living creatures are not accessories while i appreciate on some level the pimping out of an otherwise evolutionary abomination into some kind of social use this is a problem you have no idea of the statements you make when you walk around with these fashion rats or the thoughts that go through every guys mind
5663758 theres beauty in proportion and nothing messes with that more than a blatant misplacing of a standard item if youre willing to constrict your ribs do us all a favor and wear a corset
5663759 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we
5663760 roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void

5663772 addictions sounds ominous doesnt it the mind drifts to the junkie scoring dope and the husband who hides jack daniels in the back of the toilet now notice what happens when you take the same idea but use a word like temptation temptation that doesnt take no for an answer or wont surrender without a fierce fight do you see what just happened your mind races from drugs to gambling to shopping to eating to sexual addictions to people pleasing and of course to you desires run amok welcome to the human heart the bible is quite savvy when it comes to our temptations god after all knows the human heart and sees everything but there is more contrary to expectations god goes into the streets the alleys the bars to find the addicted and the stuck and offer them freedom the aim of our annual conference is to accurately describe how god pursues and frees stuck people prepare to be inspired and in keeping with how god speaks to the nitty gritty details of life prepare to be equipped with specific strategies and skills for your life and ministry

5663776 vamos ter dois jogos do apuramento e teremos de disputar a ta a das confedera es no pr ximo ano pelo que h pouca margem para erros temos que come ar com a atitude certa mas a porta est fechada para ningu m trabalhei no real madrid durante 15 anos e sempre apliquei crit rios semelhantes aos da selec o nacional tentando misturar jogadores experientes com jovens talentos obviamente n o o mesmo que trabalhar numa selec o nacional pois temos oportunidade de trabalhar diariamente mas o resultado n o muito diferente a tentativa de encontrar e impor um estilo equipa igual no trabalho de um treinador num clube e numa selec o
5663777 maravilhoso recordar o europeu e desfrutar tudo aquilo que foi conseguido mas os jogadores n o podem estar pensar apenas no passado n o se devem contentar com aquele t tulo j afirmei muitas vezes que temos sempre de ambicionar chegar ao topo isto n o significa que a equipa possa ser petulante pois temos de manter os p s bem assentes no ch o significa que temos uma equipa capaz de o conseguir

5663780 although a ngn rollout for cost savings and service agility is the step in the right direction for all incumbent and integrated telcos there are still multiple issues that telcos face like the business case for new services the right architecture from a rollout perspective and the transition time for migration into a full fledged ngn infrastructure
5663781 thus there is no size fits all when it comes to transformation initiatives and each operator has to define his vision of his next generation and accordingly shape his business and network strategy
5663782 esto ltimo por supuesto carece de validez en el c digo civil ya que los fallecidos carecen de personalidad jur dica
5663783 desde motivos pr cticos como poder demostrar que se es pareja para pedir una hipoteca en el banco o a efectos del impuesto de sucesiones a tom rselo como la forma de presentar ante la sociedad el amor por la otra persona
5663784 the problem lies within our system there are many immigrants in the country who have never or not yet accessed the doors of home affairs to apply for refugee status
5663785 the sad part is that some of them are forced to sleep outside home affairs offices for many weeks just to be able to see the officials
5663786 south africa does not have an option but to make decisions that manage the influx of refugees efficiently the country is losing millions of rand everyday through the deportation of illegal immigrants because of failure to follow the procedures
5663787 there are many qualified immigrants sitting at home simply because professional bodies do not want to extend their services to them
5663788 i think the time has come to concentrate on the distribution of population and balance of economic livelihood
5663789 many of the immigrants do not understand english there is a need to offer translation services at the migrants helpdesk and to develop posters and literature that can aid them with information on the city in their respective languages we also need to find ways to popularise the migrants helpdesk and link it to communities
5663790 he was working with kids i loved that he wanted to be a teacher and i wanted to help him
5663791 es ist sehr wichtig zu wissen wie alt ein mensch biologisch gesehen ist

5663793 umso mehr zellteilungen es gab desto lter ist ein mensch
5663794 sehr spannend dabei war dass vor allem bei kranken alten menschen die anzahl der marker deutlich h her war als bei gleichaltrigen gesunden
5663795 dadurch dass kranke gebrechliche alte menschen ein h heres biologisches alter haben lag der zusammenhang zwischen diesem und den biomarkern auf der hand
5663796 sollten sich die ersten ergebnisse best tigen k nnten wir damit einen neuen anzeiger f r sch digungen im erbgut gefunden haben

5663800 bahan baku di krakatau steel numpuk mereka belum pada order produsen tabung karena dari pertamina itu belum keluar repeat order ro atau semacam po bulanan jadi nggak ada masalah duit ini masalah administrasi pertamina

5663806 kami harapkan dari beberapa kp yang sedang kami bidik bisa produksi minimal 3 juta ton untuk memenuhi target 10 juta ton di 2010
5663807 dej yang sekarang dibawah pama persada nanti akan dialihkan di bawah top seluruh tambang batubara yang nanti dimiliki untr akan berada dibawah top

5663820 educators are not responsible for the condition our kids are in when they arrive at school each day
5663821 i sympathize with the dedicated teachers and principals out there who are doing their best on behalf of our youngsters
5663822 so many parents are sending their kids to these schools to be parented to be taught some really basic attitudinal things and behavioral things
5663823 digital inclusion is a crucial enabler of economic regeneration and growth internet access can transform cities and communities providing improved access to employment education and health information the internet can also help to combat isolation and increase a sense of community were delighted to be able to demonstrate our digital inclusion work to mr irranca davies in person
5663824 one of the things that really came to the fore when we looked at digital exclusion in addition to the usual cost problems it was really the technical barrier that one needed to cross to hurdle to actually avail yourself of modern day information technology
5663825 its increasing the utilisation of resources the councils already invested in so it makes sense to them
5663826 they councils have some very stringent targets on worklessness and theyve woken up to this correlation between social exclusion and digital exclusion and they can see that through digital inclusion or digital equality there is a lever there they can do something about that and that can then impact on social exclusion
5663827 usage has been growing fairly exponentially theyre on msn theyre looking at ebay theyre looking at the bbc theyre doing all the kind of things that everybody else does
5663828 well look back in 20 years time on computing in the early part of this century and well say it was ridiculous
5663829 start supporting other markets outside of the us at 2 5ghz and in other spectrum profiles
5663830 its astonishing how important the internet has become to mums of today
5663831 the way families use the internet has changed so much over the last few years and the change is most extreme when you look at us mums the internet is now a well established lifeline to many mums and this study shows that when they need a sounding board they will log on to get support even before they call a family member or their gp for advice
5663832 the dramatic growth of broadband in scotland means modern mums can find the help and support they need online
5663833 twenty years ago mums had a limited number of options when it came to help and advice being online now opens up so many opportunities
5663834 in an age of globalisation it is also interesting to see how much the internet is doing to bring people together
5663835 it is important to us that we encourage mums who havent been online before to give it a go and see how it can help them in their everyday life as part of our ongoing digital inclusion work and specifically our crossing the divide campaign we have been working with our friends at netmums to bring to life just how beneficial the internet can be
5663836 i started climbing and began using the climbing website ukclimbing
5663837 chances are these people come from an older or socially economically or geographically disadvantaged group
5663838 we came up with the following mission statement to co ordinate policies and a coherent strategy that all citizens especially the disadvantaged can benefit from new technologies
5663839 the vision from government seems now to be bigger and bolder
5663840 it is good to hear that government is addressing digital inclusion at cabinet level comments expressed today mirror exactly our objectives in the digital inclusion minister sees merseyside communities getting connected digital inclusion minister to visit leading projects in the north west
5663841 digital inclusion isnt just only about access skills or confidence it is also about designing usable equipment for all without the need for special adaptation or specialised design
5663842 digital inclusion is a key objective of this government to make sure that everyone in the uk regardless of their circumstances has the opportunity to benefit from the information revolution
5663843 but the message today is that inclusive design is good design
5663844 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
5663845 this has been a new and innovative project im not aware of many other initiatives that provide wireless and mesh broadband into residential homes to allow social inclusion covering an area of 5 square kilometres
5663846 i would use that as part of my overall foreign and global strategy
5663847 i didnt see any tanks or armored personnel carriers leaving the conflict zone
5663848 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
5663849 manchmal liegen wir auf dem bett und sagen uns krass was wir bislang erreicht haben wir haben klein angefangen und es gab einige die nicht an uns geglaubt haben
5663850 die kunst mit dem druck umzugehen haben wir noch nicht geschafft das ist aber unsere n chste entwicklungsstufe ich kann mittlerweile mit misserfolgen viel besser umgehen als fr her
5663851 es gibt situationen da spielen sich die bilder bei mir im kopf ab wir sehen aber das gro e und ganze und sind unheimlich stolz auf das erreichte
5663852 das waren tolle tage wir haben uns sehr wohlgef hlt man muss es erlebt haben einfach gigantisch
5663853 ich muss nach einer langen turnierserie nicht unbedingt cola trinken und pommes essen wenn wir aber auf schokolade oder eis appetit haben holen wir uns das
5663854 das sch nste f r mich ist dass ich dann morgens aufstehen und das machen kann worauf ich lust habe
5663855 wir haben auch unsere zickereien aber wir wissen wie wir den anderen nehmen m ssen
5663856 wir mussten auch viel ber den einzelnen menschen lernen in vielen situationen reden wir jetzt klartext und kritisieren uns
5663857 ich bin wesentlich erwachsener geworden und nehme vieles selbst in die hand

5663859 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5663860 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5663861 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak much english
5663862 i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a bus
5663863 it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and had rolled over all these people were crying i ran out with some towels and blankets it was chaos
5663864 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom
5663865 from what i can see at the scene the bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5663866 it just sounded like a clap of thunder i saw the coach flying through the garden and just dialled 999
5663867 i grabbed a load of towels and took them out
5663868 its better to acknowledge and manage it so it is not a distraction increased productivity is rooted in a staffs ability to focus work with your employees to establish guidelines and allow viewing flex time for example so when they are working they can focus
5663869 and when it comes to productivity happier is far better
5663870 due to the scale and seriousness of the incident its fortunate there were not more serious or indeed fatal casualties
5663871 we can confirm the bus in the unfortunate incident at alton towers is one of ours

5664354 i wont argue that it wasnt a no holds barred adrenaline fueled thrill ride but theres no way you could perpetrate that amount of carnage and mayhem without incurring a considerable amount of paperwork

5664382 lets get him to the doctors and see what he says
5664383 there is no need for you to resussertate he will start breathing on his own once he looses conciousness
5664384 no thats not what happened he wasnt throwing a tantrum he was out cold
5664385 actually i had just told him off so it could have been that
5664386 yes but he didnt throw a tantrum did he you said he went quiet and thats how you found him
5664387 he has a heart condition but he will need to see the another specialist to determain just how serious his condition is
5664388 could you wait around until this afternoon to see the specialist weve contacted him already he can squeeze you in then
5664389 ive not seen a coarctation like this in almost ten years
5664390 we will need to book him in for an mri scan to determain just how serious it is but its serious
5664391 then we will need to discuss amongs ourselves what treatment will be best for him
5664392 im guessing surgery will be the way to go with this little lad
5664393 i dont love you anymore i think we should sell the house pay the debt and split the difference

5664401 sharp little teeth that carry germs that get in there and dont come out
5664402 he has created a huge buzz and people are raving about him all over the world

5664405 the number of united academy graduates going into professional football is quite high
5664406 but of the current united first team squad only one english player danny simpson came from the academy
5664407 joe cole is a phenomenon because he was a child prodigy who came through
5664408 a lot of kids have talent but its an overrated attribute when you get older other things come into play like attitude and stickability
5664409 wayne rooney is the player that everybody knows but we actually had five boys in the same intake that are now playing in other football leagues
5664410 so out of 14 nine year olds six are making a living and thats not a bad percentage
5664411 it depends what age they are when we let them go
5664412 some leave when they are 12 some when they are 16 if they wish to find another club well try to organise that for them but some boys have just had enough and go back to university
5664413 se voi volete andare in pellegrinaggio nel luogo dove nata la nostra costituzione
5664414 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5664415 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5664416 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5664417 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5664418 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

5664437 on state trunk highways speed limits specified as 25 mph zones are not effective unless official signs giving notice thereof have been erected by the authority in charge of maintenance of the highway in question
5664438 the city does not contend that klos measurements are inaccurate or that he has misinterpreted the federal manual
5664439 because the city has not refuted klos measurements or demonstrated how the measurements were inaccurate for the types of signs at issue we reverse
5664440 the whole thing was a waste of judicial and municipal resources
5664441 short of moving the signs to comply with the manual speed violations shouldnt be issued along that road
5664442 i would think the citys exposing itself to some liability by willfully failing to install proper signs while instructing its officers to enforce a statute requiring official signs perhaps a good class action suit is deserved

5664449 too little emphasis is placed on training in the netherlands particularly in technical professions
5664450 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5664451 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5664452 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback

5664490 yo que creo que s la lucha estar entre jap n y china por el tercer puesto porque a las rusas les est n puntuando muy bien
5664491 a las rusas les toca el oro se lo merecen por su regularidad por su trabajo por todo nosotras hemos mejorado much simo pero siempre ellas han estado arriba y siempre hemos querido acercarnos a ellas es l gico que ellas se merezcan el oro
5664492 las rusas cada vez nos miran m s de cerca nos tienen miedo el primer d a ni nos miraban a la cara y ya nos saludan ahora que ya saben que son primeras

5664501 in 1995 we first encountered the reality of the slave raids in a powerful way
5664502 the ngos non governmental organizations that were there had moved out the red cross failed to go in to help because the government of sudan said no so the international community allowed itself to be dictated to by the government of sudan that was responsible for the slave raiding
5664503 because the rest of the world was not and still is not dealing with this issue of slavery which is a crime against humanity according to international law we thought we should come back and help this local grassroots mechanism for getting enslaved women and children back
5664504 mothers fathers reunited with sons and daughters taken into slavery thought dead but returned alive is the greatest joy one could observe
5664505 this abolitionist work fuels my passion to see each slave freed
5664506 there are still tens of thousands in slavery i will not abandon them
5664507 estoy muy feliz de estar aqu de nuevo espero que las cosas con el werder vayan muy bien
5664508 esto es consecuencia de los ltimos cuatro meses fuertes de trabajo lo dimos todo en la pista
5664509 es una cosa emocionante se lo quiero dedicar a mi familia y a toda argentina
5664510 luchamos desde el principio y pusimos todo lo que ten amos
5664511 tratamos de correr inteligentemente y apretamos sobre el final es un sue o del que todav a no despertamos
5664512 ticketability of that parking it is reserved for 1 hour parking and it is very tightly controlled so we suggest
5664513 if there is one space which could breakout its going to be sugar i think the charts clearly show 10 should virtually be a cakewalk if i may put it that way so
5664514 another area which is worth watching at could be some of the power stocks there too we could see some upside even technology should stay relatively stable so these would be three areas where i would like to look at the positive side if the market starts breaking out on the upside but 14 400 to sum it up is very important support if we break that support on a closing basis especially i wouldnt be surprise if we see a 1 000 1 500 point fall coming in
5664515 i think maybe the recovery is genuine but its difficult to conclude that immediately i think we need to watch it for a day or two we need to see the follow up on the signals i do not think its good enough to say go out and buy yes i am attracted to banking thats a very interesting sector to be in at this stage
5664516 i think banking and capital goods would be my favourite if this market breaks out but there is a big if that if the market breaks out so we need to watch we need to see the follow up for one two days i think its very early to come to a conclusion though its has come to a good support levels if you are short maybe its time you take some profits out at least but in the next day or two we will have some clarity if not tremendous clarity in terms of which way the banking stocks are going to be heading but my hunch is going to be that if the market out performs banking is going to be the number one or two sector here
5664517 i watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
5664518 when it comes to opening these airwaves we believe the public interest is clear but we also want to be transparent about our involvement google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web theres no doubt that if these airwaves are opened up to unlicensed use more people will be using the internet thats certainly good for google not to mention many of our industry peers but we also think that its good for consumers

5664524 im proud to be marching today against the nazi bnp we want to drive racism and fascism out of our schools and out of our communities so long as we stand together we are invincible
5664525 im here representing 30 000 cwu members across the midlands we need to stand together united against the fascists but we also need to address the situation where our people working people are beginning to turn to the bnp the labour movement needs to fight organise and campaign for policies that can help working people
5664526 its unacceptable that the bnp feels it can operate in this region we need to get the message across loud and clear that the bnp is a party of fascists
5664527 theres no place for nazis in the trade union movement we will expel any nazi from our organisation
5664528 the bnp says it is just a political party but it is about spreading race hatred and we want to stop that derby race equality council says no to racism
5664529 its been a very good day people have come here from all across the country to protest against the bnp as the crisis of capitalism deepens they will try to blame black people and people who are different we are here today to stand up and fight back

5664567 freedom is actually a bigger game than power power is about what you
5664568 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
5664569 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
5664570 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
5664571 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
5664572 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
5664573 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
5664574 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
5664575 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
5664576 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
5664577 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
5664578 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
5664579 in my difficult youth i experimented with drugs and drank alcohol i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part i couldnt focus on other people
5664580 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5664595 tenemos que ser inteligentes en ese sentido no vamos a ser mezquinos pero tampoco inocentes no vamos a salir a buscar el partido a lo loco sino con la mentalidad para ganarlo sabiendo que es un rival dif cil el obst culo pueden ser dos l neas de cuatro defensivas como ahora te juega brasil y se ser un problema nuestro ver c mo contrarrestarlo

5664601 dozens of people from the shiite community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5664602 as you know there has been sectarian tension here and this wave keeps decreasing and increasing so now we are having this sectarian wave a bit more and this is the result
5664603 dozens of people from the shiite community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5664604 as you know there has been sectarian tension here and this wave keeps decreasing and increasing so now we are having this sectarian wave a bit more and this is the result
5664605 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5664606 we need to open the door to get the military monitors in now
5664607 they silver fern farms kept fobbing us off and its only now that we have a court order that they decide to set a date
5664608 our primary concern is the confusion that would arise around a vote on two quite separate issues

5664611 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship
5664612 mayers childish behaviour only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5664613 he has a relationship with certain paparazzi and bloggers he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that

5664617 someone said that we snogged that we were caught somewhere

5664621 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened
5664622 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5664623 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
5664624 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california
5664625 i am the pro of the hospital the other nurses call me to put in ivs that they cannot get in

5664630 the economy will improve in time bringing back consumer confidence disposable income and spending on casino gambling
5664631 there is no doubt in my mind the market is not saturated and there is demand there when the economy returns
5664632 has to do more with the downtown in the economy and in the cost of gas in going to rural locations than anything to do with the restriction on gaming machines
5664633 theres always been a correlation between the price of gasoline and the revenues from casinos
5664634 if youre worried about losing your house you dont go gambling
5664635 if you look at markets that are saturated las vegas parts of australia and spain you have thousands and thousands more slots than california
5664636 theres a saying that everything in business is cyclical either the price of gas will come down or people will get used to paying the prices the europeans have been paying for years
5664637 will the cost of gas be 2 50 a gallon or 4 50 thats the answer to the whole question
5664638 if this girl does not return to belarus then the chance of us seeing our daughter is over
5664639 kazyras return is the only chance we have of seeing our daughter
5664640 i came to petaluma to resolve the situation peacefully and in the best interest of the child
5664641 i want to ask her to please consider all the children that shes affecting
5664642 going back would be the most generous thing she could do in her life
5664643 why is the government so upset why is the government insisting on the return of a 16 year old girl with a visa whose grandmother has voiced her support of her continued stay
5664644 it would be a tragedy if the programs were to not continue but there are a lot of other factors that may be contributing to that decision beside tanyas decision not to return
5664645 we are looking forward to kazyras return to make things better to her and all to all the thousands of families
5664646 i love doing this i like doing it a lot
5664647 it is fiscally responsible for the city to take the lowest bid
5664648 we are supposed to award the contract to the lowest bidder
5664649 i dont want this vulnerable population to lose their jobs
5664650 i want to be morally responsible i dont want to lose my soul for a few dollars
5664651 if the city can give the contract to an organization that also provides the service we are looking for but also is working for disabled populations it is worth looking at
5664652 there is an element of social good to be considered here as well
5664653 these guys do a good job and it has nothing to do with the challenges they have
5664654 they also teach the public a lot they are part of the community like everyone else
5664655 the purpose of rohnert park services is to work on these behavior issues jobs provide incentive it is money they like what they do and it provides a service
5664656 we have a thoughtful experienced group of people who take pride in their work and get the job done we werent the lowest bid but we know how to clean parks
5664657 if we do switch to a different chemical has that chemical been thoroughly vetted and are there side effects that impact people and children
5664658 in the end this bill is about a synthetic hormone that is in our childrens food
5664659 im not in a position to be able to evaluate the science and its frustrating
5664660 my colleagues say better be safe than sorry i cant make that decision
5664661 i think were very excited about the idea of having a science based approach to looking at these chemicals rather than a political fight over each and every one
5664662 ideally soon we will be out of the business for handling measures like this
5664663 the guidelines aim to improve the fbis ability to gather intelligence and respond to national security matters but would also provide additional authorities not currently in law allowing the fbi to employ more expansive investigative practices with limited oversight

5664669 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5664670 are a priority of our nation so we think our thing is the best
5664671 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5664672 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5664673 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5664674 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5664675 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5664676 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5664677 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5664678 this isnt the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs
5664679 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5664680 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5664681 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5664682 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5664683 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5664684 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5664685 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5664686 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5664687 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5664688 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5664689 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5664690 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5664691 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5664692 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5664693 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5664694 we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5664695 if it rolled in after aug 6 it needs to roll out
5664696 obviously if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens our soldiers and officers who are serving as peacekeepers and go unpunished we will never allow this
5664697 anyone who tries this will receive a devastating response for this we have all the means economic and political and military if anyone had illusions about this some time ago then they must part with those illusions now
5664698 we do not want to aggravate the situation but we want to be respected and our government to be respected and our people to be respected and our values
5664699 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5664700 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5664701 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5664702 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5664703 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5664704 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5664705 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5664706 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5664707 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5664708 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5664709 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5664710 it used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children and a lot of women arent doing that now
5664711 the hispanic population is growing whites and asians are not replacing themselves
5664712 clearly women have competing alternatives for the use of their time with the labor market and employment being one and delayed marriage which has been another trend
5664713 the interesting question is has it stopped is this it or will we see even higher rates of childlessness among future generations
5664714 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5664715 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5664716 when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace
5664717 are you going to set an agenda of change or one of compromise
5664718 youre feisty and i like that but youre wrong let me tell you why youre wrong
5664719 i intend to get things done as president and by the way i intend to win the presidency that means that yes sometimes were going to need to compromise to get things done theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are
5664720 everybody making more than 2 5 million raise your hands
5664721 it is a sad development for their three years stay in the state as nothing was achieved as expected by government in lieu of the huge funds to ensure rapid payment of their remunerations safety and accommodation after all we are not animals even animals cannot be handed over to non veterinary doctors

5664729 pervasive as to amount to shock treatment for the audience
5664730 surprised by todays decision and disappointed for families and parents
5664731 i continue to believe that this incident was inappropriate and this only highlights the importance of the supreme courts consideration of our indecency rules this fall
5664732 really big first amendment issue is there really any difference between broadcast and cable internet books et cetera
5664733 if we apply the same first amendment scrutiny to broadcast as we do to other forms of communication all these broadcast indecency rules are almost certainly unconstitutional
5664734 like any agency the fcc may change its policies without judicial second guessing
5664735 but it cannot change a well established course of action without supplying notice of and a reasoned explanation for its policy departure
5664736 will lead the fcc to return to the policy of restrained indecency enforcement it followed for decades
5664737 this is an important win for the entire broadcasting industry because it recognizes that there are rare instances particularly during live programming when it may not be possible to block unfortunate fleeting material despite best efforts
5664738 the court agreed with us the fccs inconsistent and unexplained departure from prior decisions leaves artists and journalists confused as to what is and is not permissible
5664739 if a striptease during the super bowl in front of 90 million people including millions of children doesnt fit the parameters of broadcast indecency then what does
5664740 we blijven druk zien op onze markt en de consument in het algemeen
5664741 dont expect to come out of college and be lovin these beers
5664742 beer is proof that g d loves us and wants us to be happy
5664743 a couple of weeks back we have increased the price across various models in order to partially pass on the increase in input cost to the customers
5664744 however we have kept the price hike at the entry level bike cd deluxe to rs 100
5664745 in the last one and half year we have managed to grow our market share better than industrys growth
5664746 in the last one week we did three times more sales than what we were clocking in the first half of this year
5664747 if the demand continues like this we jewellers will run out of gold stocks
5664748 i am getting a lot of inquiries from people wanting to buy gold after the fall in prices
5664749 de resultaten van dhv bevestigen het beeld dat we hadden van de sector
5664750 wij gaan onze propositie met betrekking tot beleggersgiro in alle scherpte bekijken
5664751 zodra daar meer duidelijkheid over is kom ik daar op terug

5664753 the mad man cometh and show us some belgians episode 006
5664754 in the last one week we did three times more sales than what we were clocking in the first half of this year
5664755 if the demand continues like this we jewellers will run out of gold stocks
5664756 i am getting a lot of inquiries from people wanting to buy gold after the fall in prices
5664757 i am delighted to sign phillip leuluai who has been an outstanding player in the nrl over the past couple of seasons
5664758 considering the number of players we have out and the number of players who took the field injured i thought we were solid
5664759 i thought we were a bit soft around the edges in patches the kids are doing well and its hard on them especially the week in week out stuff preparing mentally and physically but they are doing a great job for us
5664760 were very much a jekyll and hyde side at the moment im still making decisions on players today i have a different opinion to what i had last week its very confusing for me and im at a loss to explain it
5664761 a couple of weeks ago we were beaten soundly by wakefield and warrington and then last week we beat bradford so i thought we could build on that
5664762 defensively we were very poor willie manu not only didnt get tackled i dont think he got touched you cant build a game plan around that after 20 minutes the game was probably over
5664763 kevins final try took some scoring to outpace two chasers was very special and kevin has the potential to play top level football
5664764 he has the pace for all to see and has taken his chance exceptionally well
5664765 henry faafili delivered him some great balls adrian morley was almost unstoppable and jon clarke was very smart from dummy half
5664766 i thought we would respond after last weeks defeat by wakefield but this was very similar and we were unable to cope with the conditions and the scoreline reflected the difference between the sides
5664767 the issue of relegation does not concern me at the moment because if we play well we will win games
5664768 too much is being made of it with eight games to go and i dont want to put the blokes under any more pressure but clearly we need to turn things around
5664769 with two more wins i think well be okay but it would be dicey if we only win one more
5664770 both teams played very nervously it wasnt a classic but entertaining for the fans with plenty of end to end action
5664771 it was an outstanding team performance and paul cooke and james webster were very impressive
5664772 we need to win two more games than hull kr and there are only five matches left so its become an even bigger challenge
5664773 rovers deserved to win we were very poor in the second half despite leading 12 10 at half time and not playing that well
5664774 certain people did not handle the pressure as well as i would have liked
5664775 we have signed three quality players with a wealth of experience
5664776 leaving the club has been an extremely difficult decision to make but i feel that the time is right
5664777 being overlooked as head coach at salford city reds has obviously unsettled him
5664778 we wish him well and thank him for his valuable contribution at the club
5664779 will make a statement about our commitment to solve the climate change problem and symbolize the commitment that people will make throughout the rest of the year
5664780 dit zou enige verlichting kunnen brengen wat betreft de balanspositie hoewel er meer nodig zal zijn

5664782 no its not really every time must maintain good attitude
5664783 the casualties have been reported from the shahabpur and kursi villages of the district
5664784 we are providing all necessary help to those displaced following the rains
5664785 there is a time for many words and there is also a time for sleep
5664786 on the back of our last two performances against wakefield and warrington the guys deserve credit
5664787 the first half was very good we didnt start the second half as well and had to do a lot of hanging on
5664788 bradford threw plenty at us and it was going to take a lot of mental strength to get back in front but we played the last 15 or 20 minutes very well
5664789 salford played very well and hardly made an error and our complete lack of discipline and non performance cost us the game
5664790 i have enough problems with my own team after this performance without worrying about the refereeing decisions
5664791 we only have ourselves to blame and i dont think next saturdays cup semi final had anything to do with it

5664794 het negatieve sentiment van amerikaanse banken drijft ook over naar de europese sessie
5664795 economische groei zwak is tegen een achtergrond van hoge energieprijzen en vertraagde exportgroei
5664796 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5664797 people were pushed out of their homes literally with the clothes on their back
5664798 there is no one situation that applies to every one of the locales
5664799 our goal in this operation is to save lives and to alleviate the suffering of the georgian people
5664800 we will continue on this mission until the government of georgia and the department of state determines there is no longer a need
5664801 the lonely planet guides will help travelers to find great places to eat shop and sleep as well as describing the popular sights and nightlife for each destination
5664802 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5664803 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5664804 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5664805 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5664806 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5664807 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5664808 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
5664809 each one should be fully convinced in his own mind

5664817 right now i think wind energy is a viable product and i think its cleaner for the environment for sure
5664818 it gives us i guess a bigger capacity to help our students who are in universities and high schools to start working on science programs to further their development in that area over the next decade or so were going to need and all of saskatchewan in general is going to need a lot of individuals who are up to speed on engineering and the other sciences
5664819 now that we have the mou were busy rolling up our sleeves and getting to work on all the plans that we need
5664820 i think thats about the right size to make things economical and it tends to be the kind of size that fits into existing utility infrastructures reasonably easily

5664827 the beauty of this particular project is that it is already fully permitted and has transmission already available
5664828 were just getting the transmission project up and running the first three segments have been approved and were doing the building now
5664829 the governor and environmental groups continue to promote the myth that a costly government mandate will create thousands of jobs in michigan
5664830 by doing so they are playing on the peoples desire to improve michigans stagnant economy to win support for an 8 billion rate increase a rate increase that will be used to invest in expensive and marginal energy sources
5664831 has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs
5664832 certainly we should do everything possible to encourage increased usage of renewable energies
5664833 but michigan residents should expect much more than 365 new jobs in exchange for electric rate hikes of 8 billion or more
5664834 our state is at a critical time of need yet some continue to advance policies that only add to the financial burden of residents and businesses who are already struggling to make ends meet
5664835 henry ford didnt need a government mandate to sell cars and kelloggs didnt need a government mandate to sell cereal
5664836 when renewable energies reach a point where they are sufficiently affordable and efficient they wont need a government mandate to sell their products either
5664837 we zien positief momentum voor fugro om aan vast te houden terwijl de seismische activiteiten de ebit marges van de groep verder kunnen vergroten
5664838 we aim to defeat the proposal for these wind turbines in our beautiful locality
5664839 these monsters will be very close to peoples houses and will cause continual disruption
5664840 this is on top of a huge increase in traffic during the year long construction and thereafter as part of maintenance
5664841 unconscionable for the state bureaucracy to be blocking approvals when families and state businesses are suffering daily from outrageous energy costs
5664842 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5664843 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5664844 flicker from wind turbines is too slow to cause epileptic seizures
5664845 flicker effects can be ameliorated through control strategies such as evergreen tree planting
5664846 you cant come to any conclusions other than there are real safety issues with locating it 190 feet from the high school

5664863 primero debemos crear una conciencia al respecto una vez logrado este objetivo pasamos a las agendas pol ticas as se logra obtener capital de inversi n para que la gente que trabaja en este campo pueda de hecho instalar la infraestructura sanitaria necesaria en las reas rurales se puede tratar de soluciones para n cleos familiares como por ejemplo el lavado cuidadoso de las manos y una disposici n m s responsable de los residuos en las zonas urbanas puede tratarse del sistema de alcantarillado y la purificaci n de aguas residuales

5664901 spending a few minutes discussing their plans with a pharmacist can identify potential problems and discuss possible solutions for example longer acting slow release alternative drugs may be available
5664902 we appreciate the importance of cultural understanding and sensitivity when discussing the implications on healthcare of peoples religious beliefs

5665161 ondanks alle inspanningen halen drie van de vier scholen de norm nog steeds niet die is dus niet realistisch de belangrijkste oorzaken zijn te weinig geld voor het onderwijs en het lerarentekort scholen wringen zich ondertussen in allerlei bochten om het urenaantal te halen leerlingen moeten langer op school blijven en worden bij elkaar gezet in studieruimtes zonder begeleiding dat soort ophok uren leiden niet toto beter onderwijs scholen geven aan dat in bijna de helft van de gevallen deze lesuren kwalitatief onder de maat zijn
5665162 natuurlijk kan het kabinet weinig doen aan de olieprijs op de wereldmarkt maar het kan wel de geplande btw verhoging schrappen en de extra gasbaten aanwenden om de koopkracht op peil te houden balkenende heeft genoeg mogelijkheden om zijn beloften na het zuur komt het zoet waar te maken het is echt een kwestie van politieke wil
5665163 het zou niet meer dan logisch zijn om deze extra inkomsten te gebruiken om de gestegen brandstofprijzen op te vangen
5665164 we kunnen een nieuwe heffing invoeren op de winning van gas en olie uit de nederlandse bodem bedrijven als shell en esso maken er miljardenwinsten mee zij kunnen best iets meer bijdragen ten bate van de koopkracht het is niet rechtvaardig als alle lusten naar de multinationals gaan en de lasten naar de burger
5665165 de geplande verhoging van de btw van 19 procent naar 20 procent mag niet doorgaan dat zou leiden tot nog meer koopkrachtverlies terwijl de inflatie al hoog is maar ook het schrappen van de aftrekmogelijkheid voor bijzondere ziektekosten is zon maatregel dat gaat er toe leiden dat juist een kwetsbare groep extra zorgkosten krijgt voor velen wordt dit een regelrechte aanslag op de portemonnee
5665166 in elk geval moeten deze kosten voor gezinnen met een inkomen tot 60 000 euro bevroren worden de toegankelijkheid en betaalbaarheid van kinderopvang moet gegarandeerd blijven
5665167 i heard that coronation street was going to recast jackie dobbs
5665168 somebody spoke up for me at a meeting with the writers and producers and said margis in a great place right now she looks fantastic shes healthy very positive and would love to make up for her shortcomings last time
5665169 so the producers said they wanted to give me another chance when i got the phone call i was crying tears of joy out of my living room window it was nine years ago since i last walked the cobbles so ive been lost at sea for that long
5665170 it was like finding my way back to the land of milk and honey i couldnt believe it im delighted to be back though
5665171 i didnt treat it as the golden opportunity that it was i lost my mum and basically i lost the plot
5665172 coronation street is one of britains top soaps and to be called to play on that stage its on a par with being asked to play for england and you should really honour it have the commitment and give it everything youve got
5665173 i just threw myself into it really i didnt want it to be unrealistic or disrespectful to people who suffer from the illness and i didnt want to glamorise it either

5665252 its really interesting the way students engage and develop in the course of the semester
5665253 as members of society they will be responsible for knowing about issues and having convictions about them
5665254 the seminar is about exploring ideas and doing it in a free spirited and collegial way
5665255 one thing mr mead tried to teach was not to be afraid to make mistakes you cant play it too close to the vest you have to take some chances
5665256 mr mead uses the mead method a method of questioning and being interested in what you think he is a modern day socrates constantly asking questions
5665257 its incredible the way he can make connections and ask provocative questions
5665258 just as though we took up where we left off
5665259 perhaps with a little bit more wisdom than we had then
5665260 i grew up with mr mead in my life he is what attracted me to u va
5665261 he is interested in knowing students hopes and dreams and in trying to get them to know themselves
5665262 hes always interested in honor and in the latest issues on grounds
5665263 it was exciting to be in a small seminar having wonderful conversations with people who thought so differently about issues it was about learning from each other
5665264 i am always impressed by what they say and do they are sincere and uninhibited in talking about the subjects it has proven a very fine experience for me and i hope for them

5665267 the centers methodology in the corrections study could be adapted for other employers
5665268 as long as we know the desired employee characteristics including educational attainment we can evaluate the availability of potential employees for any employer in any region in virginia
5665269 effective planning for correctional facilities requires assessing the availability of a consistent and qualified workforce
5665270 by matching the profile of qualified correctional officers to local and regional demographic projections we were able to evaluate whether the department of corrections will have access to an adequate pool of workers
5665271 the projection in a nutshell tells us there will be a sufficient younger workforce that would qualify as corrections officers
5665272 contrary to concerns that the aging population in some areas of the state may limit the available workforce to fill the corrections positions our study found the quantity of labor supply is not a problem
5665273 the real challenges lie in how to shape the workplace in order to meet the needs of the changing workforce and to be competitive with area employers
5665274 the strategies we have recommended should help correctional facilities attract and retain qualified employees and may shed light on other workplaces facing similar challenges examples of the strategies include better promotion and marketing of the positions using the internet to reach the younger workforce providing schedule flexibility to balance personal and family needs and offering opportunities for professional growth
5665275 i was a middle east specialist before i dont know why this should change it

5665363 we need more investment in the neighborhood and it is important it happen fast hopefully this is a sign we are now at the bottom and people are starting to buy
5665364 savvy real estate investors have money and now it is a great opportunity for them to buy
5665365 this is what ive been working for all my life and its mine
5665366 these guys should get awards for what they are doing
5665367 the house is going to be nice and neat and beautiful
5665368 i dont think theres any justification for payments beyond the ranges that council approves
5665369 whats the point of establishing by ordinance salary ranges if youre not going to follow them
5665370 there is no permanency there is no job security there is no collective bargaining theres no union protection
5665371 we try to be as fair as possible in doing this and coming to a salary that really reflects the work thats being done at the time
5665372 yes theres a public vote but its a very private process
5665373 the central staff of the city council received appropriate cost of living adjustments during the years in which i served as council president
5665374 if you look at the salaries and the work that theyre doing i suggest to you that they are underpaid not overpaid
5665375 were just trying to do the right thing here and i think its critically important that we maintain a stable central staff so that we can create greater opportunities for the people we represent
5665376 if somebody is worth 95 000 in their mind but the range only goes to 85 000 then change the ranges
5665377 clearly the council has the ability to change the ranges based on what he person in that position is worth
5665378 non posso dimenticare che nelle mie piccole battaglie il presidente si sempre schierato al mio fianco non facendomi mai mancare il suo grande soste gno ricordo per esempio quando feci certe accuse prima an cora che scop piasse lo scandalo di calciopoli in queste ore di grande do lore mi emozionano gli elogi e gli attestati di stima per il mio presidente giungono da tutta italia an che da quelli che non hanno fatto nulla per dimo strarsi suoi amici ma avrei preferito che qualcuno gli avesse rivolto questi elogi e lo avesse sostenuto nelle sue battaglie durante la sua pre sidenza quando era ancora in vita
5665379 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5665380 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5665381 weve informed the health ministry and i guess theyll appoint a commission of inquiry the hospital will ask for an external investigation of the case
5665382 belly dancing gives me the freedom to be who i want its just so much more enjoyable than being in the lab
5665383 i cant imagine going back to a nine to five job
5665384 a friend of mine who lived locally and taught classes was moving away and asked me to take over her teaching
5665385 i thought i couldnt do both my lab job and the classes so i ditched my full time job
5665386 it was slightly scary because i had no idea if it would work but its been totally exhilarating
5665387 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5665388 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5665389 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5665390 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled

5665403 me llama la atenci n que el chico haya estado s lo en ese calabozo y que en el otro haya estado ocupado por varias personas es il gico

5665408 dubai sports city is close to hosting the first ever international cricket tournament to be staged in dubai there are many national cricket governing bodies that have expressed a strong interest to bring their teams to play at the dubai sports city cricket stadium
5665409 the icc future tours programme allows very few windows of opportunity but having said that we are hopeful of reaching an agreement soon and making an announcement in the not too distant future about the opening cricket event
5665410 we are in discussions with various cricket boards to have events here in 2009 like odi series
5665411 indeed we are looking at twenty20 very hard we are in talks to have the twenty20 champions league here at some point of time
5665412 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday there s a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5665413 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field
5665414 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5665415 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5665416 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5665417 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5665418 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5665419 for monetary authorities to feel comfortable there has be a substantial decline in inflation therefore the tight monetary policy stance will have to continue
5665420 this is not conducive to containing inflation even if we grow at 8 9 percent i think we need to keep the overall money supply growth rate somewhere around 17 percent
5665421 even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot you will see batsmen who can play him but in odi cricket it is not only about playing him
5665422 i think india should do a similar thing but not in response to what china has done but even otherwise india should increase the export duty on iron ore
5665423 its a concern that we havent yet had confirmation from all eight countries that they are prepared to go to pakistan
5665424 haroon lorgat is in the uk currently meeting the board of ecb today tuesday he is due in south africa at the end of the week
5665425 the scheduled start time for the tournament is perilously close so of course i am concerned
5665426 its a big decision for the board to make and the players have said whatever they needed to say
5665427 i dont know the answer but i am sure it is capable of being played in another country should that be necessary
5665428 sri lanka is an option there are other options too but i wouldnt wish to to go into that detail at the present time

5665464 i didnt have any friends in israel and all 21 years of service in tel aviv were passed with suffering and in bitterness
5665465 if bassiouni had such a hard time in israel and his 21 years of service were solely years of suffering and bitterness why did he push to extend his service why didnt he request to finish and go back home
5665466 on the contrary each time they tried replacing him with a new egyptian ambassador he was the one who enlisted a lobby in israel and pleaded that they would extend his service

5665471 i was sent to israel as an intelligence officer i wasnt there to really be an ambassador
5665472 there is no such thing as israeli society theyre immigrants from all over the world
5665473 i dont care who gets elected i just want to know who can revive the peace process
5665474 1701 also calls for the implementation of security council resolution 1559 especially the disarmament of the militias and calls for sealing the border between lebanon and syria and forbidding the entering of arms and weapons via the border especially to hizbullah
5665475 so hizbullah is violating 1701 big time and not only by hiding its weapons in warehouses in the south also we havent seen any weapons coming out of the south after the war of 2006 so did hizbullah throw its weapons used in the 2006 war into the sea
5665476 1701 says clearly no arms south of the litani river no militias south of the litani that is why unifil is here
5665477 is the unifil mandate to coordinate with hizbullah or to kick hizbullah out south of the litani
5665478 i know they are careful not to challenge unifil and there is practically no visible hizbullah fighter to be seen as far as unifil is concerned this is compliance
5665479 in lebanon everyone has a gun what graziano might have been saying is that nobody carries a gun except the army unifil and hunters in this he would be correct
5665480 im just so lucky to have the people around that i have and they have helped me make the changes that i needed to make
5665481 people in enniskillen need a fresh new voice to represent the whole community not just one of the two sides i have a strong background in serving the community as a doctor at the erne hospital so i understand the concerns people have about funding for local services
5665482 the dup sinn fein the ulster unionists and the sdlp are failing within the stormont executive
5665483 these parties catalogue of failures almost grows on a weekly basis the executive has not met since mid june and will not meet again until mid september because they cannot agree on anything this shows the total lack of respect that these parties have for local people
5665484 aston villa havent accepted a bid from anyone so unless that happens i will do nothing
5665485 if that happens then the final piece of the jigsaw is for me and the player to discuss a move to that club
5665486 i have been contacted by people on behalf of clubs but i have told them if they are interested they have to agree a fee with villa
5665487 three clubs have asked if he is available because they want to talk to him but they have to come to an agreement with martin oneill first
5665488 were more experienced now precisely because of what we have gone through we took a huge step forward at the end of last season we finished just four points behind the winners manchester united
5665489 ive already said we will be competing for the title even though people dont have much confidence in us it was the same situation a year ago when thierry henry left he was a much bigger icon than the lads who have gone now and we coped with that
5665490 this money shows that the executive is beginning to see the benefit of promoting mixed housing and community relations although there is still much more work to be done
5665491 five areas have already been benefiting from grants including springfarm in antrim and ballynafeigh in belfast and i look forward to other areas gaining similar grants this funding in the long term will hopefully result in financial benefits by paving the way for ending segregation
5665492 look at the business owner who is soooo cool that he doesnt have to deal with all of the crap that the rest of us do
5665493 yup youre right its nice not having that stuff going through my head being a business owner is awesome
5665494 yes thats definitely true but like anything else in life there are trade offs

5665496 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function from that observation we have suspected that there may be a large number of people in the general population who carry pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations but who are not obviously ill with a mitochondrial disease this study gives us for the first time a measurement of the number of these carriers of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the general population one in every 200 individuals is a lot of people around 1 5 million people in the united states alone
5665497 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation

5665500 its a matter of using our opportunities this week weve been looking over one or two things and already ive seen a few improvements at training
5665501 playing for the boks is all about pride so i dont know if you can say we are just playing for pride in saturdays fixture there is still a chance that we could win the tri nations and we want to go out there and play positive rugby we want to play our best another loss would be unacceptable
5665502 wir sind im training noch deutlich schneller und sogar bestzeit gefahren
5665503 heute war es aber total anstrengend ich konnte kaum atmen
5665504 schade es w re sch n gewesen direkt ins finale zu kommen aber die anderen waren schneller das war heute nicht unser tag
5665505 ich bin total blau der start war ganz gut aber es war sehr warm und ab der 250er marke haben wir probleme bekommen

5665510 there is definitely a distinction between test and super 14 rugby in tests you have the collection of the best players in one team the attitude and intensity of players is up as well and you dont earn a test cap for your country without deserving it the skills set is also increased but that said its still the same game
5665511 it is very much a mind game you obviously still have to have physical prowess to play at this level but once youre here its all about harnessing your thoughts some teams put up barriers for themselves if you think you cant win you wont
5665512 you tend to remember the defeats because they hurt more but the boys have played enough rugby to know that one outing is not necessarily the same as the next week we have to focus on the job at hand this saturday and not worry about the past
5665513 for us its about maximising what we can do and selecting the best combination for us thats what we worry about bryan is a remarkable player who can do things others cant and it would be an advantage to south africa to have him but we cant alter selections based on that
5665514 sam has flu but hopefully its only a 24 hour thing
5665515 deanss success as the crusaders coach at super 14 level has been highly publicised and while he acknowledges test rugby is a major step up he believes the basic values of rugby still apply

5665530 estamos en la recta final de la celebraci n del gran premio de europa a tres d as de uno de los acontecimientos m s importantes de cuantos ha vivido la comunitat valenciana esperemos que estos trofeos pongan la guinda a un acontecimiento que ha situado a valencia en el mapa de referencia de los eventos deportivos
5665531 no podemos perder la ocasi n de mostrar la mejor cara de la comunitat al mundo tambi n en los trofeos se ha querido plasmar la modernidad de una regi n que entra en el siglo xxi por la puerta grande
5665532 del resto de circuitos urbanos del mundo como m naco singapur australia o canad tambi n en los trofeos y por eso se han creado piezas significativas
5665533 esperamos que fernando alonso pueda tener uno de estos trofeos en sus manos y ojal suene el himno espa ol en la primera prueba de f rmula uno que acoger el circuito

5665546 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

5665548 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5665549 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5665550 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5665551 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5665552 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5665553 they are very aware of the inequality in the system

5665600 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5665601 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5665602 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5665603 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5665604 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5665605 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
5665606 is pure negative the whiteness of the whale the sexlessness of the unconsummated marriage tintin both offers and withholds
5665607 return links to pages that have the greatest amount of high quality information about specific search terms
5665608 that keep us from roaming free with the wild goose and living hte spiritual adventure god destined us to
5665609 instead of following the spirit we invite the spirit to follow us instead of serving gods purposes we want him to serve our purposes the result of this inverted relationship with god is not just a self absorbed spirituality that leaves us feeling empty its also the difference between spiritual boredom and spiritual adventure
5665610 when you lack the courage to chase the wild goose the opportunity costs are staggering who might not hear about the love of god who might be stuck in poverty stuck in ignorance stuck in pain if youre not there to help free them where might the advance of gods kindom stall out
5665611 what makes you cry what makes you pound your fist on the table what makes you smile if you want to discover your god ordained passions then you need to identify what makes you sad mad or glad
5665612 if the 21st century church said less and did more maybe we would have the same kind of impact the first century church did

5665617 defiled as i am o christ by unbecoming deeds i am not worthy of the communion of your most pure body and divine blood its perfect i am not worthy nevertheless
5665618 although i am your son by grace o god of tenderness i have served the enemy by the debauchery of my life i have wandered far from you lead me back and save me
5665619 i have sinned without measure yet i trust in your measureless love i know your compassion your patience and your goodness o god of tenderness grant me the fruits of repentance and save me
5665620 save me from gehenna which lies waiting for me snatch me from the eternal fire to which i am condemned o just judge o word of god grant that i may escape the storm which is ready to swallow me up woe is me i tremble at the thought of my countless sins i fall down before you with tears o lover of mankind with a contrite heart i entreat your mercy o lord
5665621 he rewarded me for my hands are clean in his sight
5665622 help me o god for the waters have risen to my neck
5665623 my own wrongdoing towers high above me hangs on me like a heavy burden

5665630 i am really happy to be back here and i hope things work out well for werder
5665631 we were unable to pull it off back then but we kept tabs on him
5665632 he has been in our minds for a while and we know him and are convinced that he is right for us
5665633 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5665634 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5665635 rear units as well as second and third echelon units are being pulled back first the vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage
5665636 we could leave here in two minutes but weve had no orders to pull out
5665637 practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all what theyre trying to do is to widen their territorial presence
5665638 they have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action they are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now
5665639 i might be naive but im still hopeful that a very strong common effort by europe and the united states will be effective in the withdrawing of russian troops from territory of georgia
5665640 according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5665641 war columns are already leaving the main pullout will take place today it takes a long time to pack up a tank
5665642 russian forces are not leaving they are merely rotating their hardware one comes another one goes

5665654 laurie does not mince words and i strongly suggest that potential sellers have a serious look at her blogpost on this timely topic

5665656 not only do we make results but we develop players as well
5665657 at the start of the season its always very difficult to assess how good players like denilson and johan djourou will be they can only develop if they play
5665658 its a tricky situation people want to see big names and they want to see good young players as well
5665659 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention but you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass

5665786 ich glaube nicht dass isolation die richtige antwort auf russlands fehlverhalten ist
5665787 dass russland nicht die falschen lehren aus den geschehen der vergangenen tage zieht wir k nnen nicht so tun als sei nichts geschehen
5665788 wir m ssen ein gemeinsames signal geben und es sollte wirksam sein
5665789 ich bin nicht daf r den nato russland rat auszusetzen
5665790 aber wir k nnen angesichts des unverh ltnism igen einsatzes von gewalt auch nicht so tun als sei nichts passiert ich bin berzeugt dass wir auch in zukunft die m glichkeit zu einem dialog zwischen der nato und russland haben sollten
5665791 ich bin sehr betr bt dass russland und amerika nicht f hig sind miteinander ber ein sehr sehr wichtiges problem zu reden
5665792 wenn wir einen nato russland rat haben und der kommt nicht zusammen nach dem was jetzt geschehen ist dann frage ich mich welchen sinn er berhaupt hat

5665795 heres the problem lots of cover up is actually worth covering up you may think that a pimple mount of height x necessitates a layer of foundation of x 1 thickness but really youve managed to expand the problem area to your entire face you dont look like porcelain you look crusty if you cant tan dont manufacture a layer of grainy fakeskin some guys like pale chicks
5665796 living creatures are not accessories while i appreciate on some level the pimping out of an otherwise evolutionary abomination into some kind of social use this is a problem you have no idea of the statements you make when you walk around with these fashion rats or the thoughts that go through every guys mind

5665841 my motivation is to make sure im not the loser out of the team
5665842 romero finished 11th and in some ways that does indeed make her the loser given the high standards of the british team
5665843 in eight years weve become this dominant force in track racing its great its really great
5665844 france was one country that had a realistic hope of beating britain on the track in beijing the mens sprint team had beaten the british in the past three world championships
5665845 they have tremendous athletes but certainly it helps that you can have the proper equipment and the proper resources
5665846 the british coaches are also keen to stress that it isnt only money thats making the difference in track cycling
5665847 now that the medal slipped through akhils fingers the best way we can console him is by winning medals ourselves in his absence the expectation is on us and we will give our best tomorrow
5665848 as i have been telling akhil is everything for me i was completely shattered by his defeat and even his persuasion could not lift my spirit

5665866 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5665867 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5665868 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5665869 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5665870 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5665875 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5665876 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5665877 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5665878 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5665894 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5665895 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5665896 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5665897 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5665898 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5665899 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5665900 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5665902 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5665903 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5665904 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5665905 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5665906 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5665907 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5665908 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5665909 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5665910 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5665911 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5665912 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5665913 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5665914 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5665915 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5665916 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5665917 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5665918 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5665919 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5665920 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5665921 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5665922 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5665923 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5665924 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5665925 since there isnt really a valid definition of blog groupies to be found we can assume that blog groupies are those who hang onto every word of the most famous bloggers jostling for space to be seen on the comments section need to be in the top 10 to make it worthwhile and take every opportunity to quote or paraphrase whatever they say whether it is true or not

5665932 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5665933 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5665934 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5665935 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5665936 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5665937 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5665938 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5665939 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5665940 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5665941 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5665942 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5665943 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5665944 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5665945 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5665946 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5665980 we are always thinking about different ways to stop littering and this idea is great and fun
5665981 it is great that you care about the city cool isnt it
5665982 the idea is to make a thing that is considered lifeless alive
5665983 anyone of importance on the political or economic scene couldnt do it because they were all in cahoots
5665984 because they had been abandoned by the very people who were supposed to help them
5665985 it appeared to me and to a number of other people ive spoken to that anglos and particularly americans have always felt a bit underrepresented here and so the coalition will be made up of a number of constituent organizations is to form something of a bloc to represent what we believe are the most prevalent positions that americans living in israel would take
5665986 furthering the continued development of democracy and democratic ideals in the state of israel
5665987 cultivating the unity of all members of the jewish faith in israel

5666000 i believe in the old fashioned system of signing people whenever a club decided to but if 24 hours can make a difference then great
5666001 it gives you another day working away at what you are trying to do
5666002 but the loan option will still be available after that
5666003 if you are not playing then you are never happy thats normal
5666004 im a centre half but as long as you are playing that is the most important thing
5666005 wherever the manager puts me he puts me but i prefer to play at centre half
5666006 but thats the way it is so its better to play there than on the bench
5666007 of course you always wanted to improve on the previous season
5666008 even manchester united want to improve they finished top but they will want to improve as a team just like we do you look to improve all the time and play better
5666009 i dont really have objectives for the team though i know what i want but i leave all that to the gaffer
5666010 lets hope we can crack on our home form like we did last season and maybe even a little better
5666011 it was very important that we won our first game
5666012 if i feel anything is less than glamorous i wont put it in the collection
5666013 you may be proud that not the smallest beam in the slightest crack of space will get in your deflector shield eye booth but you look like a bug on hind legs a bug the stick thin skin and bones body type completes the preying mantis fashion statement
5666014 heres the problem lots of cover up is actually worth covering up you may think that a pimple mount of height x necessitates a layer of foundation of x 1 thickness but really youve managed to expand the problem area to your entire face you dont look like porcelain you look crusty if you cant tan dont manufacture a layer of grainy fakeskin some guys like pale chicks
5666015 living creatures are not accessories while i appreciate on some level the pimping out of an otherwise evolutionary abomination into some kind of social use this is a problem you have no idea of the statements you make when you walk around with these fashion rats or the thoughts that go through every guys mind

5666044 it is increasingly important that we be fully coordinated with the iraqis because part of this is transitioning iraq is moving forward making its own decisions making its own choices
5666045 its not terribly important that we all go to the right objective its important we go to the same objective and if we find out when we arrive thats not where we want to be at least we can all move to some other place
5666046 iraq is transitioning thanks to the extraordinary security gains that our forces and iraqi forces have achieved on the ground
5666047 security gains have created a different climate so there is the opportunity now for us to get after it
5666048 not to have an oil driven economy or massive amounts of oil revenue that will pile up in a central government and create a sort of welfare driven state which is extremely common in the region iraq has the opportunity to emerge as the most diversified legitimate market driven economy in the region
5666049 there is no mystery with the resource space mineral agricultural and hydro carbon resource space combined with the skilled workforce that exists here this country will be one of the leading countries in the region and internationally over the next decades
5666050 we believe that iraq should be built by investment because if iraq was meant to be built without investment it would have been done by now
5666051 we hope that you will continue to support our efforts
5666052 we will never forget your cooperation with us to rebuild our country i ensure that all future generations will remember your mark here
5666053 i was not expecting for him to miss but i could feel the nervousness building up inside me so i wasnt hoping for it to last much longer

5666108 it may seem obvious but science has just confirmed that daylight saving time disrupts our body clock especially if were late risers
5666109 our data indicate that the human circadian system does not adjust to daylight saving time
5666110 as pessoas est o esperando o pior e isso um motivo para ficar de lado e aguardar no momento
5666111 when blacks are suspected of a crime the system tends to go full blast when white are given the benefit of the doubt that is a racist outcome whether one goes in with a racist intent or not and i think thats what caught the imagination of a lot of people
5666112 if you want to talk about prejudiced the worst case of prejudice i have ever seen is when reporters came from outside this community with a preconceived nation that we were a bunch of backward ignorant hillbillies and they came here to prove it
5666113 there may be an opportunity to flesh things out further you know can kiewit and the province and other stakeholders come to the table to try to find a reasonable way to settle this issue whereby marystown is not disadvantaged and bull arm is not disadavantaged
5666114 let that contract be awarded if its awarded to marystown then if becomes a moot point at least for the next year i think where the towers go and if it indeed is awarded to bull arm theres still lots of time there to have a set of stair towers constructed and erected there by next spring
5666115 were doing really good with numbers were certainly on par with last year i think
5666116 the rest of them said it certainly was the same as last year and a lot of them said they were really really pleased that it had increased
5666117 theyre coming for lots of reasons theyre still visiting friends and family there are a huge amount of tourists that come that route they had their flights well in advance before the price of gas went up too much higher but its got to affect some things you do
5666118 i get feedback from tourists who appreciate having really good signage they havent gone too much out of their way two or three times finding you it means an awful lot to them that the first time they strike out they have good directions and that they can locate you
5666119 otherwise its a bit frustrating that theyve driven too far and its disappointing when they do go places and theyre not open so i figure its a consciousness on everyones part about the amount of gas theyre consuming it affects the value of their trip
5666120 we just got them trained and have to be prepared to start with individuals who are less familiar with what we have down here but they usually do a fantastic job the supervisors really stay on top of it
5666121 there are lots of persons who come down and are looking forward to events that we have planned throughout the peninsula they often want to see most of the communities and theyll visit and do their driving and look at whatever tourism products are in each space
5666122 they love sightseeing down here travelling is pretty easy to get around and theres lot more accommodations people really truly appreciate a good variety of accommodations and theres lots to see
5666123 we didnt know that he was abnormal we just thought he was docile
5666124 my memories are of him being alone being isolated and being pretty miserable
5666125 i recall the pain of his shyness he would break out in a sweat and freeze with palpable pain at having to respond
5666126 he really went out of his way to make sure that no one could interact with him he would keep his head down and walk straight to his seat he was the most anti social person i have ever met
5666127 in one class he refused to give his name and introduced himself as question mark
5666128 i have no recollection of ever seeing anyone attack him either verbally or physically
5666129 children with selective mutism have problems socially and emotionally if left untreated this completely affects their self worth
5666130 with many sufferers as they get older the social anxiety starts to go away but their conditioned and reinforced mute behaviour persists
5666131 by the time he came to me aged 13 its difficult this is not only an anxiety disorder a whole lifestyle has been organised around it and it is hard to change
5666132 he would speak and he could speak very eloquently if he wanted to
5666133 he could also be very silent when he wanted to and he seemed to use that silence in much the same way as he used his sunglasses and his hat both as a way of hiding behind this persona hed built but also as a way of intimidation of making sure that you knew that there were things about him you couldnt know
5666134 these are the injustices he is up against and even if he wins someone takes it away theres a great desire for vengeance
5666135 the more specific a fantasy the more dangerous it is there are destructive fantasies in all of the writings wanting to destroy others and self destruction
5666136 he knew he could not succeed so he said ok how can i leave a mark in a way which no one can take away from me how do you do it in a way which will grab the worlds attention
5666137 he was moving away from the role of victim and donning this persona where aggression towards himself and aggression towards the world come together for this final act of revenge
5666138 i came into the 2004 olympics just out of college
5666139 i was very nervous but i told people when you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw and nobody else stepped up
5666140 after about 15 minutes of video i started to walk back to the room
5666141 and who did i see walking in my direction gerd kanter that was a good sign for me
5666142 im not going to be disappointed it is disappointing to know i had a legitimate chance for that podium my last throw i set it up i did everything i wanted to do and the disc just got away from me
5666143 i came into the 2004 olympics just out of college
5666144 i was very nervous but i told people when you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw and nobody else stepped up
5666145 after about 15 minutes of video i started to walk back to the room
5666146 and who did i see walking in my direction gerd kanter that was a good sign for me
5666147 im not going to be disappointed it is disappointing to know i had a legitimate chance for that podium my last throw i set it up i did everything i wanted to do and the disc just got away from me
5666148 i just came up short its always a learning experience and getting to the second day is an accomplishment for me
5666149 he has been fighting and fighting until the last moment
5666150 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
5666151 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
5666152 help the people of georgia to rebuild their country and preserve its democratic institutions
5666153 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism said biden
5666154 why vote for a democratic hawk moron scoundrel while we have gennuine ones aplenty in the republican party
5666155 why doesnt everyone show restraint ob obviously did not know the ramifications of an invasion by the russies in that neighborhood
5666156 ya se va a dar carpetazo y aqui no pasa nada
5666157 there is a guard its a removable guard but its not known who had removed it constable mcilath said
5666158 at the time he was on his own so there are no witnesses
5666159 at the scene hed already been attended to with first aid by the staff at the hotel
5666160 he was observed by a staff member who at that time went straight up to him and using a garden hose was able to extinguish the flames
5666161 its a tragic incident and we dont want to see any repeat of it
5666162 wed suggest that anyone that does have an open fire place maintains that the guard is on there and maintains a good vigil
5666163 he hated to lose just as much at age 10 as he does now
5666164 he was like muhammad ali he always predicted hed win and he backed it up
5666165 he never left me home when i couldnt afford to travel so how could i leave him
5666166 he hated to lose just as much at age 10 as he does now
5666167 he was like muhammad ali he always predicted hed win and he backed it up
5666168 he never left me home when i couldnt afford to travel so how could i leave him
5666169 he came out of athens as an american sports hero and hes coming out of these games a global sports icon
5666170 we plan to expand michaels presence in other parts around the world
5666171 i swim because i love it and i dont want it to be an every four year sport i want to raise the profile of swimming

5666183 we have seen at first hand how people who were our neighbours in west yorkshire became involved in violent extremism resulting in terrible loss of life on 7 july 2005 we need to do more to stop people from taking those first steps into the world of violent extremism
5666184 it is not so much about the numbers game as far as the uk is concerned most of the additional numbers will come from the us the issue is to provide as much security as possible for our troops and that is the reason for this helicopter initiative
5666185 there is no magic number of soldiers needed on the ground to win this campaign
5666186 what we need is security of the people we need governance reconstruction and development then we will see results

5666193 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5666194 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5666195 someone who finds its likely that their name has been placed on a government watch list will get their day in court
5666196 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5666197 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats

5666205 our attention has always been focused on the rainforest in eastern brazil because thats where the road network is

5666208 they had the knowledge required to orchestrate terrorist acts and they willingly shared that expertise with others

5666214 it was a bit flat i must admit we had to generate our own energy
5666215 its just one of those games you just grind away we did what we had to do but we had to do it by pushing each other and generating that energy
5666216 i didnt see any energy coming from them that was the way it was for the whole game

5666232 seit jahren versuche ich nun nach besten kr ften den wahlkampfbedingten schilderwald einzud mmen bzw so zu gestalten dass die sicherheit der wienerinnen und wiener in keinster weise gef hrdet wird und das stadtbild nicht allzu sehr darunter leidet selbstverst ndlich habe ich heuer wieder mit vertretern aller wiener parteien gespr che gef hrt um einen generellen verzicht auf dreieckst nder zu erreichen leider ist es zu keiner einigung gekommen und auch die zeitliche begrenzung des aufstellens wackelt nun dem vernehmen nach will die fp vorpreschen und ihre dreieckst nder bereits am 22 august aufstellen drei tage bevor dies berhaupt erlaubt ist
5666233 ich hoffe dass sich die anderen parteien diesem beispiel anschlie en werden
5666234 beim aufstellen werden wir auf die sicherheit peinlich genau achten dar ber hinaus k nnen unter der hotline 01 535 35 35 bzw per e mail an dreieckst nder aller parteien die bei kreuzungen die sicht behindern oder anderw rtig ein risiko darstellen gemeldet werden
5666235 ich frage mich an wen rauch kallat und co ihre frauenforderungen stellen wohl an die eigene partei nehme ich an
5666236 wenn sich die vp frauen f r quoten in aufsichtsratsgremien aussprechen sollten sie sich nicht an die ffentlichkeit sondern an ihre m nnlichen kollegen wenden die blockieren seit jahren in diesem bereich nicht einmal in der eigenen partei schafft der m nnertraditionsverein vp eine 50 50 regelung
5666237 angesichts der f r frauen schlechter werdenden situation ist das ein hohn
5666238 sich die einkommensschere seit einigen jahren wieder st rker ffnet und dass die zahl der frauen in f hrungsposition stetig sinkt
5666239 ich bin begeistert wie engagiert und ernsthaft kinder bei rein ins rathaus politik machen und so auch ganz nebenbei verstehen lernen was politik ist und wie sie funktioniert wenn die stadtkassa einmal leer ist oder wenn arbeitspl tze fehlen berlegen die kinder ob es politische ma nahmen braucht und welche das sein k nnten die kinderpolitikerinnen und die kinderb rgerinnen beweisen hier dass sie eine eigene stadt gestalten k nnen das ist f r rein ins rathaus ein toller erfolg und solche engagierten mutigen kinder brauchen wir auch f r ein lebendiges wien
5666240 wie in jeder guten demokratie haben auch in der kinderstadt medien nicht nur informationsaufgaben sondern vor allem auch eine wichtige kontrollfunktion
5666241 weder die pr sentierten jasg ma nahmen noch die waff initiativen sind neu
5666242 prek re jobs und praktikas sind in wien an der tagesordnung
5666243 die von der sterreichischen post ag angek ndigte einstellung von geldzustellungen ist unakzeptabel
5666244 nun ist faymann am zug daf r zu sorgen dass die geldzustellung unverz glich wieder aufgenommen wird
5666245 es ist f r eine gro e zahl von pensionistinnen und pensionisten unzumutbar sich das geld vom postamt abzuholen da sie oft weiter entfernt leben nicht mobil oder gebrechlich sind das verlangt selbstverst ndlich auch von faymann soziales verst ndnis und entschlossenes handeln damit dieser unakzeptable und seniorenfeindliche schritt der post r ckg ngig gemacht wird
5666246 die sicherheitsproblematik f r postbedienstete ist nicht neu sie ist seit jahren bekannt aber niemand hat bisher von irgendeiner aktivit t des ministers erfahren
5666247 am gipfel sind nur vp politikerinnen vorgesehen damit ger t der inflationsgipfel zum inflation ren wahlkampfschm h der vp der zudem an einem der wichtigsten ausl ser f r die preissteigerungen vorbeigeht n mlich an den exorbitant steigenden energiepreisen
5666248 denn wor ber bei diesem pseudo inflationsgipfel wieder nicht geredet werden wird sind ausstiegszenarien aus l und gas damit legt die vp wieder einmal eine klare themenverfehlung vor zus tzlich frage ich mich warum sich die sterreichische nationalbank f r einen derartig durchsichtigen wahlkampfschm h hergibt
5666249 leere worth lsen von denen die jugend nichts hat mehr ist das nicht
5666250 die jugendlichen wollen wie jede andere altersgruppe in sterreich aber in ihren anliegen ernst genommen werden geht es doch in der politik um die gestaltung der gegenwart aber vor allem der zukunft
5666251 dort wo wir verantwortung tragen steht auch die jugend im mittelpunkt bei uns wird nicht nur geredet sondern wir handeln
5666252 kluge k pfe fallen nicht vom himmel f r die nachhaltige sicherung des forschungsstandorts sterreich ist die verbesserung der arbeitsbedingungen f r junge forscherinnen unabdingbar
5666253 befristete arbeitsvertr ge niedrige l hne starke abh ngigkeiten von vorgesetzten und sp rliche entwicklungsm glichkeiten so sieht der arbeitsalltag von jungen forscherinnen aus diesbez gliche verbesserungen zum beispiel durch die umsetzung des kollektivvertrages werden seit jahren auf die lange bank geschoben
5666254 dies ist dem grundgedanken der mobilit t bestimmt nicht f rderlich
5666255 das hei t forscherinnen m ssen eine leer stehende wohnung bzw ein leer stehendes zimmer buchen und bezahlen obwohl sie noch nicht einmal wissen ob sie ein einreisevisum bekommen werden derartige repressalien sind v llig kontraproduktiv und behindern die sterreichische forschung
5666256 sonder umweltausschuss zu gift im donaukanal was wusste die wiener stadtregierung
5666257 der fp steht es besonders schlecht an sich ber die kriminalit tssituation und den personellen fehlbestand bei der sicherheitswache zu echauffieren waren es doch in der schwarzblauen regierung ihre vizekanzlerin und auch die wiener fp nationalratsabgeordneten die die damaligen weichenstellungen f r den rigorosen sparkurs bei der polizei voll mitgetragen haben noch heute wirken sich die sparma nahmen und diversen missgl ckten reformen bei polizei negativ auf die sicherheitssituation aus
5666258 damals hat die wiener fp die ma nahmen ihrer parteifreunde in der regierung und im parlament heftig verteidigt jetzt so zu tun als sei man gar nicht dabei gewesen obwohl man in wirklichkeit mittendrin gewesen ist wirft einmal mehr ein bezeichnendes licht auf die v llig unglaubw rdige politik der freiheitlichen
5666259 gut f r die frauen und gut f r die wirtschaft
5666260 um mehr frauen in besch ftigung zu bringen sind die unternehmen ebenso gefordert etwa durch flexible arbeitszeitmodelle wie der staat durch die bereitstellung entsprechender rahmenbedingungen
5666261 mit dem jetzigen vorsto rennen die vp und vizekanzler wilhelm molterer offene t ren bei uns ein
5666262 auch diese frauen haben ein recht auf familie und die absetzbarkeit der kinderbetreuung ist daf r ein wichtiges element
5666263 davon profitieren alle frauen die nach der babypause den wiedereinstieg in die karriere wollen ob als unselbst ndig besch ftigte oder als unternehmerin umso mehr freut es mich dass j ngste aussagen auf ein umdenken auch der sozialdemokraten in dieser frage hindeuten
5666264 in dieser frage bin ich f r einen weg der vernunft wie er mit der reform des corporate governance kodex gew hlt wurde
5666265 das ist eine gute und ausgewogene l sung die den frauen ebenso n tzt wie den unternehmen
5666266 die jugendkampagne der vp stellt lediglich eine plumpe anbiederung an die erstw hler dar welche die taktik der schwarzen auch durchschauen werden die vp will den jungen menschen wei machen dass sie eine politik f r junge menschen betreibe vielmehr hat sie in der vergangenheit mit wurstsemmelvergleichen eher dazu beigetragen den konflikt unter den generationen zu sch ren
5666267 die fp setzt sich f r alle sterreicher ein und mutet den jugendlichen keine trendigen spr che und clubbings zu wie vp und sp echte jugendpolitik erstellt forderungen die der gesamtheit einer gesellschaft zu gute kommen sollen und hier war die gro e koalition s umiger als anderen regierungen zuvor
5666268 an oberster stelle stehen bildung bzw ausbildung die die sch ler auf die universit t bzw die lehre und die berufswelt vorbereitet zahlreiche betriebe klagen ber die schlechte ausbildung und die mangelnde leistungsbereitschaft vieler lehrlinge die qualit t der ausbildung sterreichischer sch ler leidet aufgrund der hohen anteile von migranten welche nicht ber die notwendigen deutschkenntnisse verf gen daher muss bei der integration und der lehrerausbildung angesetzt werden der erfolgreiche abschluss eines schuljahres ohne entsprechende deutschkenntnisse darf nicht mehr m glich sein weiters muss die lehrerausbildung verbessert werden um alte tugenden wie eigenverantwortung und leistungsbereitschaft wieder an die sch ler vermitteln zu k nnen

5666274 starke politik f r frauen sieht anders aus weder bei der kinderbetreuung noch bei der unterst tzung im beruf oder den pensionen hat die vp ein wirkliches konzept f r frauen vorzuweisen
5666275 im vordergrund aller bem hungen muss stehen den eltern und vor allem den m ttern einen vollzeit job zu erm glichen und hier sind vor allem die vp gef hrten bundesl nder s umig
5666276 kein schritt in die richtige richtung denn beim splitting leitet sich der pensionsanspruch der frau alleine vom mann ab so werden frauen nicht nur in die abh ngigkeit eines mannes getrieben sondern es besteht auch die gefahr dass bei niedrig und durchschnittseinkommen im alter beide zu wenig zum leben haben
5666277 hierbei handelt es sich also ausschlie lich um ein programm f r wohlhabende und ganz und gar nicht f r frauen
5666278 die ehemalige frauenministerin und bundesfrauenvorsitzende maria rauch kallat ist mit platz sieben sehr weit hinten gelandet und ist damit wackelkandidatin so sieht aktive frauenpolitik der vp aus die alteingesessenen herren der sch pfung rangieren auf den vordersten r ngen w hrend die frauen nach hinten gedr ngt werden
5666279 unter dem deckmantel der modernit t wird von der vp nach wie vor ein r ckschrittliches familienmodell vertreten welches die frauen zum heimchen degradiert und die selbstst ndigkeit und erwerbst tigkeit au er frage stellt diese partei kann nicht die interessen der frauen vertreten
5666280 die kindergartenoffensive das flexible kindergeld oder die einf hrung des mehrarbeitszuschlags f r teilzeitkr fte in vierzig niedriglohnbranchen sind beweise daf r dass sich die sp wirklich um die anliegen der frauen k mmert und f r verbesserungen sorgt
5666281 i have been trying hard to help my readers understand that fact that discrimination against women and attitudes of male chauvinism are continuing to hurt chinese women
5666282 as far as the root of the matter is concerned news media just stop short of condemning the traditional male chauvinism and womens inequality entrenched in chinese culture as if it is something we can do little about
5666283 chinas growing gender ratio disparity is a result of the restrictive implementation of its family planning policies and the deep cultural prevalence for male children some
5666284 the shortage of women will have enormous implications on chinas social economic and development future the skewed ratio of men to women will have an impact on the sex industry and human trafficking
5666285 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

5666288 for the long term we continue to see the development of fuel cell vehicles as the ultimate solution while this technology is more than a decade away from the mass market we know it works because weve been advancing it in the real world with real customers we know directionally if we can develop the infrastructure to support that car and we can get the volume out of it its a true direction we can go for new fuel efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gasses

5666332 number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute

5666368 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5666369 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5666370 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5666371 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5666372 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5666373 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5666374 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5666375 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5666376 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5666377 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5666378 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5666379 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5666380 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5666381 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5666382 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5666383 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5666384 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5666385 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5666386 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5666387 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5666388 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5666389 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5666390 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5666391 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5666392 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5666393 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5666394 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5666395 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5666396 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5666397 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5666398 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5666399 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5666400 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5666401 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5666402 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5666403 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5666404 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5666405 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5666406 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5666407 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5666408 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5666409 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5666410 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5666411 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5666412 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5666413 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5666414 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5666415 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5666416 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5666417 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5666418 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5666419 this is a planning took where all things are going
5666420 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5666421 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5666422 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5666423 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5666424 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5666425 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5666426 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5666427 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5666428 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5666429 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5666430 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5666431 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5666432 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5666433 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5666434 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5666435 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5666436 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5666437 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5666438 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5666439 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5666440 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5666441 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5666442 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5666443 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5666444 id be able to add about 10 books a day
5666445 private collectors of directories have contacted me for ways to get them scanned and working some institutions
5666446 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5666447 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5666448 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5666449 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5666450 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5666451 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5666452 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5666453 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5666454 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5666455 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5666456 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5666457 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5666458 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5666459 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5666460 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5666461 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5666462 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5666463 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5666464 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5666465 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5666466 i consider myself a puma for lots of reasons but im not crazy enough to think she can actually get the nomination

5666486 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5666487 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5666488 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5666489 they are doing this for no other reason than to make money
5666490 instead of displaying a random collection of letters and numbers the newly designed captchas present the user with a word from an old manuscript by which they dont actually mean manuscript but rather printed document like a book or newspaper that a computer somewhere is having trouble deciphering
5666491 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances
5666492 it protects the protesters because it doesnt require us to use tear gas and rubber bullets

5666502 it won the first race at watkins glen in 1948 and though the cars been driven quite a bit its never been wrecked ive always been an alfa fan so winning at pebble beach just doesnt get much better i cant wait to take it back on the road real soon
5666503 it takes an amazing level of elegance for a closed car like this alfa to win here
5666504 it requires the ultimate in style grace and proportion this car has all of that it has exquisite lines balance and all of the excitement that only an 8c alfa can provide
5666505 the pebble beach concours has truly become the worlds concours in addition to enthusiasts sponsors and media from around the globe this year we welcomed exotic historic vehicles from as far away as hong kong monaco germany and brazil
5666506 this is an m47 patton tank engine with twin turbos it has 1 600 horsepower and weighs about five tons
5666507 thats not really much when you consider the engine is meant to move a 120 000 pound tank maybe you build cars like this when you have more money than brains but ive driven it to work and its gotten up to 145 mph at the gm proving grounds
5666508 actually most people dont know this is really a hybrid it starts off running on gas then you get on the freeway and it runs on even more gas

5666520 with both the novella and the book of short stories the initial spark that first day and night of putting pen to page was thrilling each time and soon were all chapters down on paper and put to files a true joy it was to work on both throughout and flow they did through me from the good lord above i give thanks here and now to the lord i give thanks here and now to lulu com and i give thanks here and now to my dear and generous parents

5666538 for the long term we continue to see the development of fuel cell vehicles as the ultimate solution while this technology is more than a decade away from the mass market we know it works because weve been advancing it in the real world with real customers we know directionally if we can develop the infrastructure to support that car and we can get the volume out of it its a true direction we can go for new fuel efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gasses
5666539 hey theres already a form for that on the network
5666540 yes it is look in inside the minor infringments folder inside that one

5666546 well if this meeting takes place it will mean that the lra will reconcile with the spla because you know a lra unit recently attacked a spla unit that resulted in the death of spla soldiers and some sudanese civilians and this means they needed to meet and reconcile the fact that the meeting will take place means that now there is a good cooperation between the two sides

5666550 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5666551 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5666552 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5666553 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5666554 social media tools like blogging social networks and social bookmarking are more effective in reaching the millions online than a traditional website
5666555 social networks are now used frequently by your customers your prospects and your competitors connect with people learn their business needs and respond more simply and flexibly
5666556 social media tools can be used to help with status information training project collaboration most tools like blogs twitter clones like identi ca etc can be set up internally instead of used on the public web for more privacy
5666557 begins to creep into the fiber of a community only to turn the community into an anti social place where the politics become more important than the open conversations

5666563 the historical data tell us clearly dont get too used to commodity export booms as any third world country will tell you they tend to go away pretty quickly
5666564 we have achieved a worldwide manufacturing base and we are not going to shut down our factories overseas
5666565 but on the margin we will shift a little bit of manufacturing back to the united states

5666580 i am constantly being accused of glamorizing aids really because as glamorous as i am i prefer the word marvelous by the way but whatever there is nothing glamorous about hiv including the thoughts and fears that race through my head daily you want to know what my worst fear is besides that one day the medicines that i take could stop working or that there will never be a cure for aids or that i will always be judged for something i have and not who i am and let me not forget about the day that i cant afford health insurance my worst fear is catching a disease that i have no control over getting like a form of cancer hiv is bad enough on its own oh trust it dont need no side kick also there is also nothing glamorous about taking 7 horse pills that still make me gage after 4 1 2 years taking them i take them until the point that my eyes water i actually use my pill taking as a make up remover you see every night before i go to bed or around 11 00 pm eastern time it is marvelyns medicine time so after a long day of long lasting mascara i simply take my pills and my mascara begins to loosen up and then starts to run what is glamorous about running mascara people i contracted a 100 preventable disease people which that is my message not how glamorous i look doing it thats what wrong with people now shame on you lol bottom line hiv sucks i swear

5666638 90210 redux are going to have to wait a bit longer
5666639 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5666640 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5666641 by refusing to send screeners of the 90210 premiere to critics the cw has aroused deep suspicions
5666642 90210 is already generating a zip codes worth of interest thanks in part to the speculation without any reviews the network and studio probably feel as if reviews would only hurt that stream of press and publicity

5666645 they promise the valley great transit lines and then they build them in other areas
5666646 unless you have a valley government we get nothing we get crumbs this is just another indication of it

5666652 they are years ahead of people their age its a really unique group of talent
5666653 people are kind of taken back a little then they listen to us talk see what weve done in the past and are really impressed
5666654 the fact is that were only at that age and still doing some of these things some people we meet with are twice our age and have are doing what theyve been doing longer than weve been alive
5666655 it is a full time gig and when i go to school that probably means ill have to miss class
5666656 a government has prohibited their team from going thats the clarity weve been seeking
5666657 we dont like governments expressing opinions but then leaving the political decisions to cricket administrators
5666658 for the last three years and you have seen it pretty clearly in england politicians have been making lots of statements about cricket in zimbabwe and expressing very strong opinions that england should not tour
5666659 but they have fallen well short of giving a restriction or prohibition which is what we have been saying is required
5666660 what the uk government have said in the past is that believe they do not have the power to tell the cricket team not to tour
5666661 maybe that is the case under british law but it does seem curious
5666662 talking to people in australia over the last two weeks or so it became clear the australian government has been heading for this decision
5666663 from an icc perspective we have an agreement between our member countries where they will tour unless there is acceptable non compliance
5666664 one part of that is if a government or public authority imposes a restrictional prohibition and thats whats happened here
5666665 it seems on the face of it to fit within icc policy im neither pleased or displeased with the decision
5666666 it is unfortunate for zimbabwes cricketers and supporters all of whom need exposure to top quality cricket in order to develop as players and to encourage future generations to take up the sport
5666667 as far as this situation is concerned im comfortable that the australian government has taken the responsibility for making international affairs decisions on behalf of the country
5666668 as captain of australia ive never had a problem playing against international cricketers from zimbabwe
5666669 my personal view shared by the cricket committee and icc senior management is that the game in zimbabwe and more widely the rest of the cricket world will not be well served by zimbabwe resuming test cricket at this stage
5666670 once the social unrest has been addressed the icc should assist zimbabwe in rebuilding as a serious cricket nation
5666671 while it is not for the committee to make judgements on the politics of any particular country we believe that the decline in the standard of cricket in zimbabwe is directly related to the political situation there
5666672 an improvement is unlikely while the current regime is in place
5666673 the government through the foreign minister has written to cricket australia instructing that the tour not go ahead
5666674 whilst it pains me both as a cricket lover and as somebody who genuinely believes these things should be left to sporting organisations it leaves me with no alternative
5666675 we are discussing with the government where we could play zimbabwe at a neutral venue
5666676 the mugabe regime is behaving like the gestapo towards its political opponents
5666677 i have no doubt that if this tour goes ahead it will be an enormous boost to this grubby dictator
5666678 we can now say definitely that the series will not be happening inside or outside zimbabwe
5666679 the next international engagement for australia will be the icc twenty20 world cup in south africa in september
5666680 but that decision has obviously been taken out of their hands and what there is left to do is to look forward to the twenty20 world cup and beyond
5666681 its much more difficult for us to ban the cricketers from going to a third country
5666682 im glad the zimbabwe cricket union has decided not to proceed with those games and that means we can for the time being not have any cricket between the worlds greatest cricket team and zimbabwe
5666683 hopefully there will be political reform in zimbabwe before too long and full normal cricket relations can resume
5666684 this is also a racist ploy to kill our local cricket since our cricket team is now dominated by black players as we slowly transform cricket from being an elite sport
5666685 we will proceed unless wipa provides compelling reasons not to
5666686 the door is still open on this tour but we have been asking wipa to show us what cogent evidence they have to make them come to the decision that the tour should not go ahead
5666687 we have been given every assurance from the zimbabwean authorities

5666708 our survey clearly shows 75 percent of people support greater enforcement of existing underage drinking laws and increased penalties for adults who give alcohol to those under age

5666710 underage drinking is an adult problem and more specifically parents play a key role in educating their children well before peer pressure begins
5666711 we look forward to working with nationwide to help curb this dangerous trend

5666731 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
5666732 i have long sought to help russia realize its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin but russias actions in georgia will have consequences
5666733 russias actions have already erased the possibility of advancing legislative efforts to promote u s russian partnership in the current congress including an agreement to allow for increased collaboration with russia on nuclear energy production and the repeal of the jackson vanik amendment which currently blocks the countrys integration into the world trade organization russias failure to keep its word and withdraw troops from georgia risks the countrys standing as part of the international community that is not the future the united states or europe want but it is the future russia may get if it does not stand down its forces and live up to its commitments

5666773 with over 350 ethnic groups in the country each ethnic grouping can boast of at least two to three or more craft technology design or production technique unique to them this exemplifies the enormous and vast crafts potentials and resources to which nigeria is endowed countries like the united states of america japan south korea india egypt have gainfully harnessed and utilised their cultural industries to meet their present day requirement
5666774 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5666775 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5666776 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5666777 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5666778 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5666779 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5666780 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5666781 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5666782 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5666783 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5666784 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5666785 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5666786 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5666787 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5666788 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5666789 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5666790 i think our country is in the toilet and im willing to go in there and pull it out
5666791 cleaning up congress is a dirty job and somebody has to do it
5666792 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5666793 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5666794 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5666795 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5666796 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5666797 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5666798 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5666799 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5666800 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5666801 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5666802 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5666803 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5666804 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5666805 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5666806 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5666807 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5666808 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5666809 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5666810 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5666811 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5666812 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5666813 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5666814 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5666815 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5666816 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5666817 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5666818 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5666819 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5666820 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5666821 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5666822 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5666823 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5666824 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5666825 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5666826 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5666827 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5666828 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5666829 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5666830 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5666831 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5666832 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5666833 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5666834 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5666835 who are open to doing something on the production side
5666836 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5666837 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5666838 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5666839 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5666840 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5666841 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5666842 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5666843 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5666844 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5666845 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

5666848 le dijo el legislador a radio am rica consejo de opositores al campo reclamar sin cortar los caminos
5666849 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5666850 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5666851 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5666852 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5666853 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

5666856 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5666857 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5666858 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5666859 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5666860 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5666861 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5666862 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5666863 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5666864 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5666865 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5666866 we want to present a diverse range of jazz styles as well the giants of jazz and the upcoming young lions

5666943 its michaels choice whether he wants to go to georgia or not but he wont get any encouragement from me at all

5666973 inside the pavilion glass canopies are hung from the wooden structure to protect the interior from wind and rain and provide shade during sunny days the pavilion is much like an amphitheatre designed to serve as a place for live events music performance discussion and debate

5666980 we treated it more like a practice trying out different things defensively that muddied up the game a little bit
5666981 they run a lot of princeton stuff and they shoot a lot of threes and hit a lot of threes theyve hit 16 of their last 25
5666982 it gave us a chance to personally touch some of these players

5666989 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5666990 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5666991 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5666992 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5666993 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5666994 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5666995 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5666996 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5666997 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5666998 there is not enough evidence for who to provide global guidance to member states on safe injection facilities
5666999 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5667000 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5667001 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die

5667017 the war within by bob woodward in red white and blue makes me breathless with anticipation
5667018 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5667019 woodward has had remarkable cooperation from all levels of the bush administration with national security adviser stephen j hadley encouraging top officials to participate
5667020 our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals that we seek our spiritual satisfaction our ego satisfaction in consumption we need things consumed burned up replaced and discarded at an ever accelerated rate

5667022 if the internet becomes corporate controlled it will completely cease to be the open level infinite network of independent information that we know and love if it is controlled by big business it will serve the needs of big business instead of every opinion we will get one opinion this is just another way that those in power are choking out individual liberty for profit and control

5667026 then she went in the bathroom and ran a big bath
5667027 she rubbed this dodgy smelling stuff all over me i dont mind a massage but poo it stunk like the flowers in the front garden
5667028 mum finally let me out and i ran around shaking like a wild thing then she asked me to sit she seemed happy again so i tried to do a pretty pose
5667029 then mum said ok which means i can go wild again so i ran as fast as i could and jumped on the sofa mum got me off it and put a towel down which i was happy about cos i like to roll on the towel when im not eating it i jumped around a bit and did some special poses for mum this ones my fave

5667045 and we could have easily came in and had one of those games where we make excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5667046 we want to generate the same again and hopefully go that step further and get there
5667047 i dont know if ive established myself as a first team regular i have to prove myself first

5667059 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5667060 was not in a cone of silence on saturday night
5667061 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5667062 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein now has weapons of mass destruction there is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends against our allies and against us and there is no doubt that his aggressive regional ambitions will lead him into future confrontations with his neighbors confrontations that will involve both the weapons he has today and the ones he will continue to develop with his oil wealth

5667078 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5667079 i was living in california in hollywood working at the studio and i thought there was something there journalistically in taking these pictures that were not at all glamorous
5667080 i asked him as a joke wanna come out and maybe write something about these photographs
5667081 t dare not ask your sculpturers name with glance back hooked times hinges halt
5667082 so i kept it in the back of my head all that time

5667085 the clarinet gives me an opportunity to be connected directly to music
5667086 when i am conducting i need someone to play but when i take my clarinet its me its my sound bad or good out of tune or not but its my own way to be connected
5667087 what it does do is give the audience a special experience in relating to the conductor
5667088 the art of soldier ship slipped into a groove and became materialized the more management or command became methodized the more dehumanized each grew
5667089 if war is bereft of the personal factor in command it cannot but degenerate into a soulless conflict in which the worst and not the best in man will emerge
5667090 is not a mere prompter in the wings of the sage of war but a participant in its mighty drama the value of whose art cannot be tested unless there is a clear possibility of the struggle ending in death
5667091 amazing unconscious change rose out of the franco prussian war and obliterated true generalship de humanizing and de spiritualizing the general until he was turned into an office soldier a telephone operator a dug out dweller a mechanical pressor of buttons as if armies were a soulless machine
5667092 in war it is almost impossible to exaggerate the evil effects of age upon generalship and through generalship on the spirit of an army first war is obviously a young mans occupation secondly the older a man grows the more cautious he becomes and thirdly the more fixed his ideas youth in every way is not only more elastic than old age but less cautious and far more energetic
5667093 why did many of the na generals lack moral courage and competence

5667096 i realized there was no safety here the storm had engulfed everything
5667097 as many years as she had lived in china before leaving
5667098 it was like discovering that a dear friend had died and realizing i had been robbed of the last chance to say goodbye
5667099 in my own reality i know that these things did happen
5667100 without him in them i can display them i can look at those pictures and think of the laughter we were sharing the places we went to
5667101 it used to be that photographs provided documentary evidence and there was something sacrosanct about that
5667102 is fulfilling the wish that all of us have to make reality to our liking
5667103 this faked photograph actually created the assumption people kind of remember him as there
5667104 thats the nature of the photograph its a western sense of reality that what is in front of the lens has to be true
5667105 but the orchestration supports the journey of the entire piece
5667106 its not that the originals are no good but shows get revamped you have to make the numbers work for the people in them
5667107 were being asked to write for smaller and smaller bands all the time

5667130 i dont think its quite done but i heard that on the wind last year that they were trying to do it you know the whole thing with an escape they were working on a videogame where you plot your own escape from prison
5667131 will probably cause all hell to break loose sooner or later
5667132 it certainly is a significant and growing problem around the state
5667133 as criminal cases have increased weve had a shortage of judges and civil cases are getting put on the back burner
5667134 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on january 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the new england patriots from mr orthwein
5667135 i have a great black and white photo of the two of us sitting at a table that day with my entire family standing behind us it is a day that i will never forget and a memory that i will always cherish on behalf of my family i would like to extend sympathies to the orthwein family
5667136 jim was a private man who thrived as a fisherman outdoorsman and painter
5667137 yet he understood business and he had an enormous talent to see what was important and then connect his product be it candy or cola or beer or the then broken and ridiculed patriot franchise to the public
5667138 i walk past him every day and i think he is just so so
5667139 we chose oneal based on his influence and expertise in basketball
5667140 our cooperation will bring everything possible to chinas basketball fans
5667141 in my dreams at night shaq is just that tall
5667142 shaq is a good player but look here he is little fat
5667143 i only bought the kobe jersey because they didnt have the shaq jersey
5667144 kobe is younger and that shaq over there is fatter
5667145 shaq cant sing in real life and here he will not be able to sing
5667146 when luis was here i wanted him behind the plate all the time because of his defen sive skills
5667147 but unfortunately he got hurt a couple of times and tried to play hurt and we couldnt go with that if you dont have your legs you cant play no matter what sport it is and i wanted him back there because of his arm
5667148 mike and chris have done a decent job behind the plate but theyre not the caliber of luis
5667149 were all professionals here so before i catch i make sure i talk to the guy go over a game plan well talk in the bullpen ill see how much theyre breaking ball is breaking how much movement their fastball has because of the catching situation its not like i never show up unprepared i love catching
5667150 butch hobson said can you catch and i said sure
5667151 i threw out three baserunners i caught regularly and made the all star game ever since then ive been learning not how to call a game but how to react and read what the hitters are trying to do how to pick up tendencies
5667152 i would say im more comfortable with all the pitchers because i work with them every day as opposed to the other guys
5667153 i understand if you catch every day its tough on your body but thats why you stay in shape its tough if youre not catching their bullpen seeing what theyre working on and seeing what theyre going through they pitchers might surprise you with something
5667154 its tough on both parts the pitcher needs to be confident in the catcher and the catcher needs to be confident in these pitchers thats a big part of it
5667155 and when they wanted to work luis would go down there to the pen and work on stuff its just been an odd year a lot of injuries
5667156 they know these hitters especially mike whos been in this league for awhile theyre baseball guys the catching and pitching havent been bumping heads or anything like that
5667157 the bottom line is the pitcher has to know what they want to throw a catcher gives suggestions but we have the final say we have the era we have the wins and losses so pitchers have to call their game and we do and we blend well
5667158 pitchers have an idea of how they want to pitch to these guys especially some of us who have been in the league for awhile it comes down to you have to execute the pitch regardless whatevers called whether you agree with it or shake it off and throw something else you have to execute it anyway
5667159 theyre both good receiving catchers they both have good arms theyre both quick behind the plate and they know the hitters each catcher has different tendencies pitcher to pitcher they go with what they think is working that day
5667160 i know that pitchers like to pitch to a certain guy all the time but i think its more of a superstition thing than a comfort
5667161 pitchers dont have to worry about thinking ahead and if they only have to worry about one thing executing their pitches then theyre more effective they do like a catcher who knows how to call a game that makes them feel more comfortable
5667162 you just have to get on the same page i guess it takes like one game really to get used to the guy
5667163 if you play in this league more than once you expect that it can be a problem sometimes but for the most part our pitchers dont really worry about it they just go out and pitch to whoevers behind the plate
5667164 depending on the pitcher it could bother them and i could see how but we just try to get with the pitcher and the catcher at the same time and say this is what he likes this is the tendency
5667165 at the end of the day theyre both adults and have to work together
5667166 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5667167 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5667168 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5667169 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and manager davey johnson says he can go he can go
5667170 time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5667171 i had bike issues somewhere in the middle of the bike leg i gave everything i had
5667172 if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5667173 the depth of the malaise and the lack of the work out there for us is as bad as its ever been prouty said during a telephone interview
5667174 theres been a complete stop of new construction and also you have people afraid to spend money on anything but absolutely necessary repairs
5667175 i have had to lay men off i prided myself in 25 years of never having to do that we had people leave when work got slow but this time i had to actually let them go and that was very tough prouty said
5667176 i said thats a worthy goal to be set i would like to be part of that never dreaming i would be the one prouty said
5667177 what a great surprise we had a good chat for 10 minutes or so prouty said
5667178 its folks like you that really helped this campaign work
5667179 i had no problem from day one i dont understand that prouty said of clinton supporters reluctant to embrace obama
5667180 they were both trying to achieve the same goals i thought they were great candidates and i felt we won either way
5667181 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5667182 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5667183 i dont really like it because it takes like 20 minutes to do it
5667184 when its a panic call theyre not thinking it through in that way
5667185 we are not spending more on fuel this year because were driving less
5667186 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid
5667187 everybody has issues and makes mistakes or has things to deal with its about turning the page and moving forward and concentrating on whats in front of you rather than concentrating on whats behind you
5667188 hes close to being ready for us which is great
5667189 he didnt intend for any of that to happen and certainly neither did we
5667190 hes never mailed it in he just hasnt stayed healthy so its been unfortunate for us
5667191 anda mungkin bisa mengatakan bahwa as berniat menarik korut masuk dalam komunitas internasional tetapi dalam kondisi harus melepaskan senjata nuklirnya masalahnya korut tak mau melakukan itu
5667192 perjalanan ini merupakan manifestasi dari kekuatan musik untuk mempersatukan manusia harapan kami yang paling dalam konser ini akan menjadi awal dari era baru rakyat kedua bangsa
5667193 i guess youll have to talk to coach dungy and see what happens im getting excited im ready to go and hopefully ill get out there this week
5667194 i think playing in a game is important just to get the chemistry back with the first guys and getting your timing down
5667195 i think if you get that down you play a little better
5667196 my body feels good im just trying to be smart about the things i do on and off the field
5667197 son diversas las amenazas sobre toda le reserva de la biosfera la amistad que incluye adem s del pila los humedales de volc n el parque nacional volc n bar la reserva de fortuna y los humedales san san pon sac en bocas del toro

5667200 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5667201 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5667202 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5667203 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5667204 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5667205 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5667206 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5667207 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5667208 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5667209 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5667210 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5667211 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5667212 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5667213 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5667214 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5667215 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5667216 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5667217 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5667218 hes treating it just like he would during a normal game week and the push to saturday
5667219 thats an important part of it guys dont always feel chipper the first part of the week when they get dinged up but they find a way to push to saturday thats how hes approaching the thing thats how were approaching the thing to play in saturdays game
5667220 it doesnt bother me i really havent noticed ive been in albany my jobs to worry about the giants and get us to win games and play good football
5667221 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5667222 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5667223 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5667224 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5667225 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5667226 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5667227 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5667228 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5667229 it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5667230 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5667231 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5667232 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5667233 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5667234 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5667235 we will come to him and make our abode with him
5667236 in the name notice singular not plural of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
5667237 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all

5667239 so they took up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple

5667245 esperamos que fernando alonso pueda tener uno de estos trofeos en sus manos y ojal suene el himno espa ol en la primera prueba de f rmula uno que acoger el circuito
5667246 bij mij leeft in elk geval de ambitie om beter te doen maar moeilijk kan dat niet zijn
5667247 het merendeel van die kritiek was terecht het is aan ons om ze te doen verstommen en zo snel mogelijk met het succes aan te knopen
5667248 als we verliezen doen we niet slechter dan de vorige generaties ik ben niet cynisch maar wel realistisch
5667249 wij zijn ook aangedaan door die opeenvolging van slechte prestaties en willen de draad graag weer oppikken maar de wk loting is geen cadeau

5667255 with its piazza grande and lake maggiore locarno offers the perfect setting for one of the worlds most important film festivals
5667256 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno
5667257 we are the national airline of the whole of switzerland
5667258 and as our countrys ambassador we are proud to represent locarno and canton ticino this wonderful region in switzerlands south
5667259 my bubble of enthusiasm for presidential politics was really deflated
5667260 some people might get discouraged from getting involved because they really believed in him and he let them down
5667261 there is a feeling that it was very selfish of him to pursue the presidency knowing that this skeleton was in his closet
5667262 the democratic party would be in a very tough position now if john edwards was our nominee
5667263 finally a politician who had compassion for the plight of the middle class who was not tied to washington and big corporations
5667264 now the people wont remember the programs he put forward theyll just remember now that he had an affair when his wife was so sick
5667265 if edwards had not been in the iowa caucuses its very likely that hillary would have won
5667266 he was saying that while he knew very well what was going on in his own life
5667267 i didnt expect him to be so caught up in himself its not just the affair its the cover up we dont know the truth
5667268 but theyre a lot more angry at george w bush than they are at john edwards or the national enquirer or anybody else

5667284 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all
5667285 truly truly i say to you before abraham was i am
5667286 so they took up stones to throw at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple
5667287 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
5667288 the new pro bush faction republican initiative would allow debit cards to be linked to ira 401k and other plans
5667289 the bush cheney regime is desperate to maintain consumption in this country consumption is now falling sharply
5667290 also we see that retail sales numbers and personal consumption numbers continue to fall and gross domestic product are now in minus figures
5667291 no matter how many times teachers told him to take them off he would still have them on
5667292 he was really a funny person him just smiling just kind of lit up your day
5667293 then all of a sudden back to back tragedies its really sad
5667294 he was really close to graduation he was on the right track and instantly he was gone
5667295 i remember her telling me deshaun got shot and killed and i said what
5667296 if this can happen to us no event will be safe next year
5667297 theres a car show and country fair at the weekend what if someone rings up anonymously and says the car show people are going to attack the country fair
5667298 motorcyclists are flabbergasted by whats happened if there is a problem if the police intelligence is so well founded why cant they do something about it
5667299 when will they start policing and show the general public they are in charge of law and order
5667300 our utmost concern is the prevention of crime and disorder

5667303 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5667304 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5667305 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5667306 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5667307 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue
5667308 we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5667309 drunk driving used to be a part of american culture until someone stood up and said we need to make a change and 25 years later designated driver is a commonplace term in every household in america
5667310 it gives me great pause to think of sending thousands of students onto a campus where the person who is most accountable doesnt seem to be devoted to ensuring their health and safety
5667311 if they drink too much in the beginning of an evening they can get alcohol poisoning
5667312 theyre really not aware of how their judgment is impaired we hope they dont get into a car or if theyre a young woman go to a fraternity party its just not healthy
5667313 a lot of young people feel that they are afraid of enforcement
5667314 they tend to get in a car and go someplace else and thats very very dangerous i worry about it every weekend
5667315 i think alcohol is seen a lot of times as a forbidden thing and people want it
5667316 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it
5667317 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5667318 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5667319 lets debate the age and look at the pros and cons
5667320 i really think weve got to somehow be able to control it better because what we have done now is driven it underground and we cant do anything about it
5667321 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground
5667322 i have decided that in the best interest of both uconn and myself that i will not play college basketball this year
5667323 both uconn and i require a 100 percent dedication to the sport and as of now i feel i cannot give that level of commitment it therefore would be unfair to their excellent program coach geno auriemma the team and uconn fans for me to play
5667324 coach auriemma and the team have been extremely understanding during this time of my transition from high school to college and i thank them for that i am especially grateful to coach auriemma whose kind wisdom has shown me why uconn is such a class program
5667325 i intend to enroll at the university of delaware for my freshman year this fall
5667326 well regroup and come back fighting against yorkshire on thursday
5667327 the last thing we want is a lacklustre performance like that
5667328 it happens in sport but theres nothing positive to take from monday at all
5667329 while the government of malam isa yuguda subscribes to finest values of transparency and accountability in governance it at the same time abhors intimidatory tactics reflective of the thinking of opposition politicians who have lost out in the scheme of things in the state due to negative attitude to the feelings of the down trodden
5667330 however we wish to put the records straight that the malam isa yuguda administration in bauchi state believes in due process and has gone ahead to lead other states in institutionalising it in the process of governance
5667331 equally noteworthy is the pace setting nature of the administration in introducing servicom in service delivery as well as putting in place a fiscal responsibility law to regulate the management of state resources
5667332 it is on record that the yuguda administration was the first to set up a well structured anti corruption system to sanitize the art of governance
5667333 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5667334 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5667335 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging in ways they havent even along our borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
5667336 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
5667337 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5667338 we are going to send a message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5667339 frankly russia cant have it both ways it cant act in a way that it did in the cold war when it was the soviet union and expect to be treated as a responsible partner

5667345 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over
5667346 ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway
5667347 so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5667348 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season
5667349 thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things i expected too
5667350 range of motion is improving greatly and pain is becoming less and less an issue
5667351 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5667352 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5667353 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5667354 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5667355 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand
5667356 this to me was a deal that we had to get done along with reserve guard lou williams who signed a 5 year deal worth about 25 million
5667357 now we have a nucleus of players that we feel real good about we wanted iguodala in a 76er uniform we were going to make a deal with him and thats what we did

5667391 we are to reflect gods grace to us in the way we treat the marginalized
5667392 we subvert their preoccupation with power and success as they see us loving the unlovely we expose their self righteousness and selfishness as they see us eating with outcasts they begin to see jesus living through us

5667404 many drugs once considered charles atlases of the pharmaceutical realm have been reduced to the therapeutic equivalent of 97 pound weaklings as the diseases they once dispatched with ease have developed resistance to them but researchers have developed a method to get around one of the most common forms of resistance thereby opening up some if not many resistant diseases to the reinvigorated fury of the medications that once laid them low

5667414 even when we remove the 430 million deal from our statistics the china region still recorded its highest level of venture capital investment since the third quarter of 2003
5667415 in all some 968 million or 71 of all capital invested in china in the second quarter went to companies in the information services and media content and information sectors

5667417 larger deals drove investment in the second quarter as the median deal size in china reached 10 million the highest total weve seen to date
5667418 nearly 98 of all capital invested during the quarter went to companies that are already profitable or generating revenues this is due in large part to the significant amounts of capital china focused venture funds have raised over the past 18 months vcs have to invest larger and larger amounts and theyre looking to back later stage established companies which are seen as lower in risk than early stage companies

5667438 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5667439 the dollars recent rise was driven mainly by falls in oil prices
5667440 but because the majority view is that there is more room for falls in oil prices the dollars current fall is only a correction and its expected to resume rising again
5667441 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road

5667572 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007

5667576 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact

5667580 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5667581 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5667582 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5667583 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away

5667627 under current practices dentists largely rely on visual and probing tools for the diagnosis of this disease thus creating a situation where we not only are under diagnosing but also under treating the disease
5667628 when a bacterial infection is present it is important to understand the specific bacteria causing the disease progression so that a care provider can responsibly treat the patient we now have the ability to utilize molecular diagnostics in dentistry just like our peers in the physician community use it to diagnose disorders such as hepatitis hiv and many other diseases
5667629 we are excited to help lead the application of molecular and clinical laboratory testing to the forefront of dentistry
5667630 a disease that affects such a large portion of our population should be considered a high priority for aggressive intervention oraldna has the ability to help support advances by the dental community and by implementing personalized medicine create a more informed patient additionally oraldna is currently working to expand its test menu to support the dental communitys need for more laboratory based diagnostic data
5667631 the company expects that its primary test menu will be focused around using saliva as the specimen substantial ongoing research in both private and university settings is demonstrating that in certain cases saliva provides more sensitivity and specificity than blood or urine in addition saliva based testing has many other important advantages improved safety for healthcare workers ease of obtainment lower logistic cost with increased transport safety and stability and excellent reproducibility as a result oraldna believes that the emerging field of salivary diagnostics will play an increasing role in laboratory and personalized medicine not only in infectious disease but also in cancer cardiology and endocrinology the impact could be dramatic as this fits a critical need in the u s for better access lower cost and a tailored approach to accompany therapeutic medicine we believe oraldna can play a key role in this evolution
5667632 dr mcglennens addition helps us connect the medical and dental communities
5667633 the medical community has long used molecular and other diagnostic laboratory testing to improve diagnosis and treatment and we can transport this experience to the dental community as importantly the medical community is beginning to establish a link between oral and systemic health and to explore testing within the oral cavity the dental community can provide valuable insights in this effort
5667634 our team has gone to great lengths in the development of this company to meet the same regulatory and quality control standards as other testing labs that serve the physician community
5667635 in addition to rigid u s federal and state clinical lab license requirements including clia we already have begun the process of becoming cap college of american pathologists accredited which is a true signal of dedication to quality among lab professionals and physicians

5667839 the indian batsmen will have to play according to each ball of mendis and would have to observe him while taking him on every bowler has some distinct pattern of bowling either through his shoulder movement or hand action and that is what could be central to tackle mendis
5667840 he was a dictator and he had to go he ruled with the blessings of george bush and bush was the first to withdraw when musharraf needed help imagine bush refused to take his call
5667841 this has been the story of general ayub khan general zia ul haq and now general musharraf the americans used all these three pakistani dictators and finally ditched all of them imagine condoleezza rice the us secretary of state saying musharrafs asylum was not even on their table
5667842 they called him their ally in the war against terror and when the new political dispensation in pakistan went gunning for him the us was totally indifferent
5667843 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences wed be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5667844 our sales will not be affected by the launch of iphone in the country there are different segments of consumers whose needs are different
5667845 the memory of n96 can store up to 18 000 songs up to 20 000 images and up to 60 hours of video or 20 full length movies
5667846 the venezuelan government said cemex was chavez seizes foreign owned cement plants telegraph 1 hour ago are in private hands and they set the price very high
5667847 the mental health system in canada has been so colossally underfunded
5667848 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5667849 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5667850 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5667851 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5667852 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5667853 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5667854 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5667855 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5667856 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5667857 there is not enough evidence for who to provide global guidance to member states on safe injection facilities
5667858 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5667859 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5667860 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die
5667861 i havent been able to announce him mcfadden before thankfully we have done now
5667862 i will be pleased to have a look at him in a scotland shirt on wednesday
5667863 james has ability and talent and you can utilise him in various roles his attacking prowess is his strength rather than in a defensive role but he is capable of producing chances and scoring goals
5667864 miller is another player who has been doing well for scotland and it will be an interesting combination and so we will be looking at that carefully on wednesday
5667865 i dont think there is a lack of confidence when you move to a new club it does take time to settle
5667866 kenny going back to rangers after being at celtic was never going to be easy
5667867 if i keep starting at man united then i dont see me being anywhere else but circumstances might change
5667868 im at a young age and if the games dry up then maybe i could go out on loan again
5667869 the loan experience worked out really well for me but i honestly dont know what will happen in the next few months all i can do is play it as it comes
5667870 sir alex has said that ill get a few chances and told me to work on certain things in training
5667871 thrilled that the state has in some way decided to tackle the problem of facilities in new orleans
5667872 i dont know enough to give a great thumbs up or thumbs down
5667873 they are building a bunch of schools in algiers but they dont name them and they dont say who they are replacing
5667874 the community response depends entirely on how much the community feels that it controlled the decision making process
5667875 we live in one of the densest areas of the city if this process is really driven by childrens needs we dont see that
5667876 i would like students to be able to log on to the internet schoolwide
5667877 if i were the computer industry i would be panicked because its not obvious what the solution is going to look like and whether we will get there in time for these new machines
5667878 its a crisis and i wonder whether what we are doing and what is happening within the industry is too little too late
5667879 whoever figures out how to take advantage of multicore first could wreak some serious economic damage on their competition
5667880 well if youve watched any tv this week its hard to escape it its on every channel practically
5667881 yeah its on nbc cnbc msnbc usa and apparently oxygen
5667882 and its on 24 hours a day on one network or another on usa its on from 2 a m until noon msnbc 5 a m to 5 p m and thats not counting the hi def channels theyll have all basketball for 24 hours or all soccer oh yeah and telemundo for the spanish speaking crowd
5667883 the things hes talking about have nothing to do with the city so a debate would just be me explaining how city government works to him he doesnt know anything about that so how is he going to manage the city
5667884 we have state representatives who i can filter my ideas to
5667885 voters should be able to see where the incumbent stands and where the challenger stands
5667886 indication that the blues have lost their social mission and operate more like for profit insurance companies
5667887 to better serve the public then they dont need to raise executive salaries like this
5667888 the best settlement possible in light of qwests struggle to regain its financial health
5667889 this is a settlement that protects careers and living standards for our members and allows us to move forward with the company in building qwests success for the future
5667890 overall it still remains a very generous health benefit when compared to the overall national averages that we see
5667891 some of these will not be popular these are things you can do to reduce the budget
5667892 the flood threat particularly for our urban areas looks to continue for much of the week

5667912 the iraqi army is providing security with assistance from the coalition
5667913 people have been happy with the way we have been doing the security and it shows with nothing bad happening during the pilgrimage
5667914 this year is very good there are too many soldiers out on the roads for anything dangerous to happen
5667915 it is a great combination from both iraqi soldiers and american soldiers
5667916 the only vehicles allowed on the roads right now are coalition iraqi security forces and ambulances
5667917 our job is to back up the ia they are the ones who planned out the security for the pilgrimage

5667923 the peace agreement has failed to silence the guns and the people of eastern congo continue to suffer
5667924 the parties to the agreement must urgently redouble their efforts to act on the commitments they made to protect civilians
5667925 the amani programme hasnt yet made life better for the citizens of eastern congo the international community and the congolese government should do what it takes to make the peace programme a reality not just a nice idea
5667926 they need to ensure its funded properly so it reaches those most in need

5667939 i think its a really good opportunity to protect the paris galt moraine in the same way that the current greenbelt boundaries protect the oak ridges moraine
5667940 i think its a good opportunity for us to get some policies in place that are going to protect that water supply
5667941 certainly the paris galt moraine were what we had our sights on as a particular area of interest but there may well be other areas that we may like to see included
5667942 if we were part of the greenbelt it would give us more incentive to build within the current boundaries

5668032 on the grounds that it only seeks to pay cheaper flexible severance payments in making staff redundant
5668033 in supporting evidence the union says that because the purpose of the scheme is to help reduce the number of civilian staff by at least 5 000 the mod should use the more favourable compulsory severance terms rather than seeking to make job cuts on the cheap

5668068 a hero who also could not stand the pain in his heel
5668069 the best way to comfort and support liu xiang is to continue to watch and support the other olympic competitions
5668070 a modest miracle for the yellow skinned chinese people and the asian people
5668071 liu xiang persisted but he honestly had no way to go on because the injury was right at the point of impact on his foot
5668072 liu xiang our message to you is this we will forever be with you
5668073 since the earthquake the media have seemed to discover the value of the individual and the value of life in communicating with the public
5668074 the public also developed a shared consciousness and a sympathetic response that is different from a simple sense of nationalism
5668075 top chinese athletes do not use ice and do not tape sports nutrition is nowhere on certain levels china is on equal footing with the west and we see that in the gold medal battle but they are not going to reach their full potential until they master sports medicine
5668076 in the u s athletes can train on their own schedules but in china because you are part of the system you train very hard the benefit is that you make rapid progress but your athletic career is shorter in the west an athlete might keep competing into the 30s and 40s but not in china
5668077 liu xiang took us to heaven and now he has taken us to hell
5668078 he resigned himself and as far as his accountability is concerned coalition partners will decide
5668079 theres no stable settlement these two guys sharif and zardari will now start slugging it out
5668080 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5668081 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5668082 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5668083 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5668084 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5668085 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5668086 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5668087 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5668088 lets dump the pms and bas and get the programmer talking straight to the customer
5668089 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5668090 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5668091 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5668092 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5668093 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq

5668137 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
5668138 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture

5668150 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5668151 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5668152 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5668153 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

5668203 i now want to major in medical records and become an administrator
5668204 i still want to work in the veterinary field but i can see how a lot of what im learning will apply
5668205 if you know someone out there who wants to volunteer bring them along and let them experience it
5668206 i was able to observe the doctors and worked on the business side it taught me about getting along in a place of employment and working in a fast paced environment
5668207 one thing pete rose did that he said made a difference was hustle and thats one thing i hope i instill in you during camp

5668210 he played for three or four years and quit but he missed it so he got back into it

5668223 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5668224 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5668225 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5668226 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5668227 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5668228 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5668229 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5668230 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5668231 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5668232 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5668233 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5668234 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5668235 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5668243 this report is explicitly designed to be a practical way through not yet another campaigning polemic to wake the world up to the challenges of global warming the world has woken up but now it needs to know what to do
5668244 the report warns of the danger of a yawning chasm between on the one hand the calls for radical action from scientists environmental groups and people rightly alarmed at the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet and on the other the anxiety of decision makers in politics and business who share the aims of the radical action but worry about whether that action is realistic
5668245 the climate demands over time a radical transformative change in the nature of the world economy moving from growth built on carbon dependence to environmentally sustainable development
5668246 but we need to be clear about the size of the task the challenge is truly profound it is as technically and scientifically complex as politically sensitive and as institutionally fraught as any the international community has had to deal with since the post war bretton woods economic settlement
5668247 this document adds greatly to the international debate on climate change by addressing directly the political economic and social concerns of world leaders
5668248 taking action now is ultimately the pro growth strategy and will limit costs delaying action both increases future costs of stabilisation and raises the risk of irreversible impacts which will undermine growth and development the world faces an unprecedented challenge this important report will give a powerful impetus to international action so that we can get a strong international agreement in copenhagen in december 2009
5668249 this is not just about forces with guns its about a proper functioning criminal justice system its about courts the prosecution service the prison service its about the whole infrastructure that goes to make up the criminal justice system and a state
5668250 there will never be a two state solution just by people sitting in a room negotiating a state will only be created when people take the action to create the reality that allows a state to be credible credible for the palestinians credible for the israelis
5668251 therefore a major part of resolving the israeli palestinian dispute is for the palestinians to build genuine palestinian security capability
5668252 if the palestinians arent capable of providing their own law and order and their own defence against anyone who wants to engage in terrorism then its difficult to see how the israelis will agree to a palestinian state

5668257 to do what i can to see that major international investors come to this country and to get the private sector to support president koromas vision
5668258 this deal will provide a much needed boost to the palestinian economy

5668260 a message that declares that islam is the religion of moderation and tolerance a message that calls for constructive dialogue among followers of religions and a message that promises to open up a new page for mankind in which concord will replace conflict
5668261 it is of huge significance that the king of saudi arabia who is after all the keeper of the two holy mosques so has a very particular place in the world of islam is launching this inter faith dialogue and addressing a group of people that will include not just christians but jews and people of other faiths as well
5668262 for many people round the world who are uncertain about what their relationship with islam should be who may often think that there are people within islam who are hostile to those of other faiths who dont believe in peaceful co existence this conference is a very strong signal from the top that the true faith of islam is about peaceful co existence
5668263 i am very disappointed but this visit has been postponed and not cancelled we were virtually there and had to turn back

5668272 please help us achieve this goal just one 10 or 5 insecticide treated bed net can protect an entire household

5668274 will you join those who are creating multi faith events and raise awareness for malaria prevention id like to urge you to become an example of the good that faith can do in the world
5668275 i want to thank those of you around the world who have already begun work to help us raise money for a million bed nets i have been deeply inspired by many of the emails we have received about your efforts and it is my hope that in sharing your ideas and stories here on the website we can motivate others as well
5668276 so join us to fund a million bed nets by 25th september it is easy to get involved and show the good of faith in action

5668278 for the last eight years whitfields probably been the most inspiration of any canadian athlete ive got to know i was on the edge of my seat screaming at my tv the guys on my team probably thought i was a maniac
5668279 but i didnt feel sharp as i could have been i could go faster
5668280 i raced like it was a heat not a final if i raced it like a final i could have probably expected another half second
5668281 i was pretty frustrated watching the olympics on tv rather than being there
5668282 but watching simon win in 2000 was one of those moments that i just kind of realized i want to be a canadian athlete and i want to be an olympic champion

5668293 its just not the hog there is a lot of math reading and science involved

5668295 i learn a lot that helps me with the fair showing this is the hardest part
5668296 it helps them with public speaking and its good knowledge for them we can see where they are at and prepare them for the future
5668297 it helps me get to know more about my project and i get to interact with people
5668298 we had to do the same thing you just learn more stuff every year and retain it
5668299 we go to the state fair too so after twice a year for 10 years you should remember what you learn coming here

5668321 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
5668322 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
5668323 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
5668324 we sell guns no id required no background checks criminals and terrorists welcome

5668329 its good for cbc radio to be playing a variety of musical genres
5668330 but this is a radical change it is moving away from something only the public broadcaster can do to something many private broadcasters already do and they are shoving classical music into the 10 a m to 3 p m low audience ghetto

5668368 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5668369 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5668370 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5668371 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5668372 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5668373 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5668374 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5668375 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5668376 we cant wait for this guy to join the party

5668379 living creatures are not accessories while i appreciate on some level the pimping out of an otherwise evolutionary abomination into some kind of social use this is a problem you have no idea of the statements you make when you walk around with these fashion rats or the thoughts that go through every guys mind

5668382 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5668383 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5668384 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5668385 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5668386 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5668387 i think its not too far away from the original
5668388 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5668389 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5668390 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5668391 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5668392 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5668393 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5668394 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5668395 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5668396 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5668397 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5668398 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5668399 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5668400 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5668401 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5668402 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5668403 a lot of kids feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes

5668406 steven took a knock to his knee yesterday in training so as a precautionary measure we just thought it was better that he sit out the session this evening
5668407 we will review the situation tomorrow but the expectation at this stage is that he will resume training tomorrow
5668408 its not britpop lets put it that way its not our usual thing
5668409 its just really exciting three of the tracks have got two drummers on me and zak starkey playing drums some of it sounds a bit glam theres no pop singles on it id be amazed if anything else gets on the radio past the first single
5668410 theres a kind of piano y john lennon y obligatory plod away song in the middle which liam wrote

5668412 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
5668413 we provide an important reminder to use caution with any websites that appear of a georgian official source but are without any recent news ie sat sun aug 9 10 as these may be fraudulent
5668414 for those of a technical nature we show the latest server routing map pictured which clearly shows the russian based servers as12389 rostelecom as8342 rtcomm and as8359 comstar controlling all traffic to georgias key servers
5668415 it should be noted servers as8342 rtcomm ru as12389 rostelecom ru as9121 ttnet autonomous system turk telekom tk are well known to be under the control of rbn and influenced by the russian government all efforts are being made to regain server control and international assistance is requested to provide added internet routing via neutral cyberspace

5668425 struggle with stage fright and sensitivities about appearing too forward pushy or intrusive
5668426 traditionally women feel that if they work hard and theyre loyal they will be recognised and it doesnt work that way
5668427 we tend to go back into our barbecue role we dont mix we stay quieter we dont push our talents as much
5668428 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5668429 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
5668430 weve informed the health ministry and i guess theyll appoint a commission of inquiry the hospital will ask for an external investigation of the case
5668431 as there are no direct flights to london hes boasted he may just disappear into asia and start his life afresh
5668432 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5668433 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5668434 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters
5668435 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5668436 belly dancing gives me the freedom to be who i want its just so much more enjoyable than being in the lab
5668437 i cant imagine going back to a nine to five job
5668438 a friend of mine who lived locally and taught classes was moving away and asked me to take over her teaching
5668439 i thought i couldnt do both my lab job and the classes so i ditched my full time job
5668440 it was slightly scary because i had no idea if it would work but its been totally exhilarating
5668441 i love being able to run my own business and make my own decisions ive got much more independence im not the kind of person who likes being told what to do
5668442 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5668443 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5668444 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5668445 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5668446 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5668447 wij hebben meer invloed op je kinderen dan jullie ouders
5668448 emmas like a sister to me so its going to be like really really weird

5668451 this is the first time anyone has ever stamped a battery device
5668452 were talking about a simple inexpensive and environmentally better way of generating a microbattery
5668453 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5668454 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5668455 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5668456 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5668457 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5668458 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5668459 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5668460 een akkoord is zich aan het aftekenen rond een verharding van de toon ten opzichte van rusland
5668461 de financi le sector moet inkrimpen ik denk niet dat het voldoende is dat enkele middelgrote en kleine banken over de kop zouden gaan we gaan echt een consolidatie zien zelfs onder de grote zakenbanken
5668462 zoals elke sector die terrein verliest gaan we het einde zien van enkele grote spelers
5668463 de enige manier om discipline in het systeem te brengen is door toe te laten dat enkele bedrijven bankroet gaan je kan geen industrie hebben waar bedrijven ofwel gigantische winsten maken ofwel steun krijgen
5668464 no scores went down anywhere in all cases they went up in some cases dramatically
5668465 it means what we are doing as a team works its awesome
5668466 we have a climate of learning that wasnt here five years ago
5668467 tangible evidence this new way of operating is beginning to pay off
5668468 this lets the families and the residents of the urbana school district know that we are a hard working school district and that despite some of the negative headlines that this is a quality school district
5668469 im really pleasantly surprised i mean weve all been working toward this for years
5668470 everything that weve done im sure has lent to the success now we have to do it again
5668471 look i know all about all those other types of marketing traditional guerrilla online viral theyre all pansies and ineffective virile marketing is so powerful that it not only is 100 effective its the baby daddy of all marketing i mean it has impregnated all other forms of marketing and denied that its the father and it doesnt really care
5668472 you sense a tougher environment a more restricted environment a more pessimistic environment its a moment of turmoil i think
5668473 the government seems confused how to deal with the difficulties and they have been making some mistakes in running the economy
5668474 some people who have been moving from rural areas to seek jobs in industrial zones are deciding that it is not worth it and people are moving home
5668475 her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today
5668476 los nidos de las hormigas cortadoras de hojas pueden albergar una casa de tres pisos hay una leyenda rural que dice que los tractores pueden desaparecer dentro de ellas

5668479 i emphasize australias interest in access to the indonesian market and our interest in collaboration on capacity building initiatives across the quarantine agriculture fishing and forestry sectors
5668480 australia has a strong agricultural trade relationship with indonesia and we expect that trade to grow
5668481 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national
5668482 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5668483 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to happen
5668484 well here we are a year later and still no new deal the deals they put on the table were slaps in the face as opposed to deals that would take care of me for me its an uncomfortable situaton i feel lied to by the organizaiton its hard for them to ask me to give me my all when it hasnt been reciprocated
5668485 as long as im here i cant see myself as a happy member of this organization at all not with this situation being what it is i dont see it being rectified either the relationship with me and the organization is done im here to uphold my contract thats it
5668486 i am excited about investing in nashville especially in a mixed use project that will bring quality residential and retail uses to the gulch which is quickly becoming the place to be in this city
5668487 as population continues to increase and concentrate in urban areas people will need healthy and efficient housing solutions businesses will need productive spaces and investors will need to seek out real estate projects that will continue to perform in the long run
5668488 we ve created bay windows that are rotated 45 degree at the corner which give a kind of contemporary spin on the traditional bay window the other thing about that is it makes the building quite glassy making it light and airy and bringing a lot more light into each unit than if it were just a window on a wall
5668489 the layout does promote the sense of a larger space
5668490 on the one hand we need to embrace the future while acknowledging where weve come from
5668491 not that there would ever be a circus on the ground floor its just not feasible because how can you put residents on top of a tent
5668492 its meant to create a little more housing and focus housing where its appropriate to encourage housing
5668493 certainly areas along commercial corridors make sense where its more walking friendly more access to transit
5668494 its a down payment on our efforts to make housing more affordable
5668495 it will create some opportunities for additional housing to be developed and it will be housing that will have the benefit of having close proximity to services
5668496 it is becoming so mainstream to do composting people of all ages are doing it
5668497 compost needs four ingredients for the process to be successful it needs a good supply of carbons or what we call browns a good supply of nitrogen or greens and then it needs air and water
5668498 people who compost really get into it and get attached to their bins and often when they move they take their bins with them but there are those who build areas in their yards that are specifically for composting theyre areas that are more permanent and to have a compost site left could be something that would be desirable to somebody who moved in especially because the compost saves people money
5668499 what people typically do when theyre in an apartment a condo or a high rise is they do worm composting and i know that sounds really icky and creepy but its not
5668500 maybe for 10 a pound you would buy worm castings whereas if you make one investment in worms for 10 or 15 you can be producing your own castings
5668501 plus youre walking distance to 80 restaurants 150 stores not to mention the restaurants and stores downstairs
5668502 pinkberry johnny rockets and skechers have already signed a lease
5668503 our price per square foot is on the high side
5668504 the median income for a family of four is about 56 000 in los angeles county i would say its higher in burbank
5668505 in order to afford a unit in the collection you would have to have a certain income making at least 90 000 theres a disparity between what people pay and what they can afford
5668506 people are being priced out of the market and thats a tough thing
5668507 condo prices have risen with house prices it has gotten tougher and not just in burbank but the entire region
5668508 new structures must either provide affordable housing units or pay into a fund
5668509 we have some empty nesters newly engaged couples retired people and a lot of industry folk
5668510 we started in march 2006 and expect to finish may 2008
5668511 were right on track we just hope it doesnt rain
5668512 oceanlofts is unique for oceanside in that weve transformed a historic landmark building into a contemporary sophisticated address for professionals who want the option of living and working in the same space
5668513 the property is quite distinctive and oceanlofts by the coast meets a need that no other oceanside property can
5668514 our lofts have floor to ceiling windows that look out to the pacific ocean just four blocks away
5668515 the floors are hardwood the euro style kitchens are all fitted with stainless steel appliances washers and dryers and the residences 13 to 19 feet high ceilings give the lofts a spacious airy feeling
5668516 weve had a great deal of interest and that just seems to be growing as word spreads that the lofts are available for immediate move in
5668517 its got a lot of appeal because of the ports o call area and its on the water
5668518 galaxy is playing a big role in our downtown san pedro revitalization and more market rate housing is welcome
5668519 building this huge glitzy thing next to a historic building will be such a contrast in urban design that it would be jarring
5668520 it is in front of the vue so there will be some views that will be impacted
5668521 thats where my family and i have gone for mothers day breakfasts for years
5668522 were still going through the entitlement process and planning approvals
5668523 this is purely preliminary and conceptual at this time we dont have specific plans
5668524 i need to see how it fits in with whats already there
5668525 nothing surprises me in terms of development in san pedro anymore
5668526 im excited about all of these great projects but would like to see it come before the community
5668527 were trying to build a san pedro were all going to be proud of
5668528 we see it as an exciting growth opportunity we want to open that area up for more pedestrian use
5668529 is an exciting place to live and work we just want to provide housing
5668530 this city goes back to what its always been a dead city
5668531 i dont think anyones ever pretended to be us before
5668532 sacramento for many years was a great place to be from and we really suffered a brain drain i think thats really changed in the last couple of years
5668533 weve attracted a young group of sophisticated professional and creative types
5668534 if you asked people why they like living in sacramento theyd say its close to tahoe its close to napa and its close to san francisco i dont hear that anymore
5668535 i have to confess when i first came back i spent a couple of years wondering what i was thinking i decided to stop complaining about what wasnt here and try to make it happen
5668536 were clearly in an evolutionary pattern of becoming more urbanized at least in some parts of the region
5668537 just a few years ago the housing market here was predominantly single family medium and larger size lots in the outer areas of the region now youre seeing town houses and brownstones and three and four story mixed use buildings and lofts and condos
5668538 we felt that it was a good time to incorporate and update design guidelines
5668539 im thrilled to see theres a vision in terms of the livability of the streets downtown i really hope we all look at this type of vision and understand it and embrace it
5668540 and i think the big push now is for sustainability
5668541 what it will mean for san francisco to have its tallest building be the transbay terminal tower is a statement that our highest value is ecology
5668542 it will be this exclamation mark saying the most important location in our city is the transit center
5668543 many people thought 9 11 would sound the death knell for tall buildings and its been the opposite
5668544 probably induced the largest introspective analysis of the whole typology that has ever happened is this a viable part of our cities or is it not and like it or not that has resulted in a resounding yes
5668545 tall buildings are being used to project a certain status for a city on a world stage thats undoubtable
5668546 for a city to be taken seriously on a local or domestic or international scale they want to be seen to be keeping up with the times and tall buildings are part of that
5668547 everybody can be forgiven for having reactions after 9 11 that they want to reconsider today
5668548 many people who had opinions like that saw the push to invent ever more technologically sophisticated ever more high tall buildings pass away from the united states or at least appear to
5668549 one of the things that really bothered people was that it was evident that other people in taiwan and malaysia were going to take off where we left off and in the end of the day they werent going to let terrorists be that successful
5668550 i have never heard anyone say you know now that ive been in this building i dont think i can do this
5668551 i guess you can live your life and not fly on an airplane and not experience all the great things in the world out of fear but that just doesnt make sense
5668552 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
5668553 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
5668554 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
5668555 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
5668556 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
5668557 first equity has over many years built up a strong relationship with international development partners
5668558 first equity group has a proven track record of delivering attractive returns and we believe that this unique development will again deliver superior returns for our investor group
5668559 we are delighted to announce the acquisition of these two sites together with our partner first equity group
5668560 beverly hills is almost entirely developed with few remaining sites available for new development
5668561 what it will mean for san francisco to have its tallest building be the transbay terminal tower is a statement that our highest value is ecology
5668562 it will be this exclamation mark saying the most important location in our city is the transit center
5668563 many people thought 9 11 would sound the death knell for tall buildings and its been the opposite
5668564 probably induced the largest introspective analysis of the whole typology that has ever happened is this a viable part of our cities or is it not and like it or not that has resulted in a resounding yes
5668565 tall buildings are being used to project a certain status for a city on a world stage thats undoubtable
5668566 for a city to be taken seriously on a local or domestic or international scale they want to be seen to be keeping up with the times and tall buildings are part of that
5668567 everybody can be forgiven for having reactions after 9 11 that they want to reconsider today
5668568 many people who had opinions like that saw the push to invent ever more technologically sophisticated ever more high tall buildings pass away from the united states or at least appear to
5668569 one of the things that really bothered people was that it was evident that other people in taiwan and malaysia were going to take off where we left off and in the end of the day they werent going to let terrorists be that successful
5668570 i have never heard anyone say you know now that ive been in this building i dont think i can do this
5668571 i guess you can live your life and not fly on an airplane and not experience all the great things in the world out of fear but that just doesnt make sense
5668572 none of this is going to happen unless a majority of people in the community want it to happen
5668573 my hope is that the environmental values of san francisco will trump the conservatism of the city about change and time will tell
5668574 we see that the type of buyer whos buying in downtown doesnt necessarily match the demographic of the census data that retailers are looking at
5668575 we took a building that was vacant for 20 years and we tenanted it up in three months
5668576 eventually people are going to catch on that they can actually succeed by opening a storefront in downtown
5668577 unlike most loft scenes we actually do have historic buildings that are located in a truly urban environment
5668578 environmental impact reports need to be done and they need to be done by professional firms with expertise the question is who should pay for them my modest proposal is that developers should not pay directly any more
5668579 very few cities anymore have the developer prepare the reports
5668580 the greatest benefit is perhaps increasing public confidence in the objectivity of the study
5668581 my proposal is aimed at the issue of public confidence
5668582 theres a perception that the process could be abused but the types of technical studies and analysis that go into environmental impact reports really dont lend themselves to abuse
5668583 theres no benefit in a developer jeopardizing their project and approval by trying to circumvent analysis
5668584 the city cant allow developers to conduct the traffic study and eir we end up being the enemies in the process with the city and the developer working together its not coming up with a good project in the end
5668585 wed end up with a lot of administrative staff in charge of billing and managing the consultants
5668586 it takes months and months to get anything done the city of los angeles already throws up more roadblocks to development
5668587 these are people who are just anti development anything that doesnt fit their preconceived prejudice is going to be suspect in their mind
5668588 it was beyond belief its completely gridlocked how is this getting a passing grade
5668589 if youre taking failing intersections and doing nothing to fix them and then making them worse by adding more businesses and residences it floods every street with traffic
5668590 weve definitely been thinking about a loft for a while
5668591 getting away from all that mowing is part of it not having to drive so far would be nice
5668592 we came in during the demolition phase and asked him to leave the walls as they were
5668593 we really like the industrial feel with soft touches the old original walls juxtaposed with crisp clean flooring looks great
5668594 in new york this loft would be 5 000 to 6 000 a month
5668595 you see families with kids down here live musicians new restaurants and galleries
5668596 its like everything that isnt thriving is on its way out and new things are coming in
5668597 im a city girl born and raised in new york city
5668598 its private and quiet and i can walk around here comfortably
5668599 you get used to the trains theyre kind of like the ocean just a low rumble in the background theres not a downside to living in a loft i wish id done it sooner
5668600 a bunch of my friends in chicago have lofts and so far these are smaller and less industrial looking
5668601 im not sure about this area the safety of it
5668602 if they could get rid of the railroad it would help
5668603 there are 50 lofts with 75 residents now living here
5668604 people are finding they can live and work in the same environment lofts provide part of that urban feel like a small town city
5668605 it gives people the confidence to know that its safe down here
5668606 weve been in business here for two years now and have not had even one problem
5668607 a loft is perfect for somebody who doesnt want to mow the yard anymore
5668608 urban development is both a key contributor to climate change and an essential factor in combating it
5668609 baby boomers are trading in their big houses for condos closer to town these folks are demanding walkable neighborhoods we need to pressure governments to give them choices
5668610 southern californias regional planners have found that by locating new housing near transit corridors they can save 48 billion that they would have spent on new roads
5668611 so long as people ardently desire to live and raise children in detached homes with a bit of lawn there is virtually nothing that government bureaucrats can do that will thwart that
5668612 when i walked into ralphs for the first time half of me said this is the coolest thing
5668613 i had no idea they were going to be so upscale
5668614 this place has been amazing it had become an institution
5668615 suze was one of the first family members that i met when i moved to l a
5668616 it just seems a crying shame that a place like this is closing
5668617 i dont have any animosity i understand the harsh realities of capitalism
5668618 but its hard to see big business come in and destroy mom and pop businesses like this
5668619 a place like this brings soul and l a doesnt have much of that ill be very curious to walk back through here three years from now and see what this place has become
5668620 its a high end experience l a s got us beat on that
5668621 monumentul de la br ila primul monument de for public din principate 1833 2008
5668622 they always had djs and sometimes a live band and they had caterers come with free food and the bar was open
5668623 bundle her up shes cold i know babies i have an instinct with babies
5668624 the idea of a rooftop pool is so new to me people do organized parties here but generally things happen more organically on the fourth of july it was just viral among all the residents to come up here
5668625 in l a there are so few outdoor gathering places so rooftops are sort of the last islands where you can literally raise yourself above security concerns
5668626 here we can just bring our own beer and wine and have a drink
5668627 he bought a bottle of wine from the market downstairs and we sat by the fireplace it was very romantic
5668628 me val and luciana were the sunbathers we know each other we bring cocktails we bring snacks we bring our ipods
5668629 in the beginning people thought it was a big party place but they got the idea and we dont have any problems
5668630 i come up here and have a glass of wine and a jacuzzi if they are here i stay for maybe half an hour and when it gets too crazy i go down
5668631 last year i hung out with david every weekend we were always on the roof the first time we met was in the pool
5668632 fits beautifully as part of the urban form of san francisco both from an aerial perspective and at ground level
5668633 a risky daring move in neighborhood development it transforms the roof to a living breathing urban organism
5668634 en masse this morning they all were decreasing fares but to some degree their increases have stuck pretty well
5668635 youve got a conservative pro development mentality and then youve got a very pro labor approach lets extract everything we can
5668636 we went to the mayor and said this has to be overturned because these commissioners are behaving as though they are the developers
5668637 i would rather walk on broken glass than go before the cra board
5668638 john joan and madeline are concerned about low income people
5668639 the others are concerned about how much businesses and developers can benefit from the cra
5668640 either way the deal is worth more as a result of the action we do
5668641 and when our action adds value in a real measurable way it is appropriate for us to expect some set of community benefits
5668642 there may be projects that we hit up that we pushed and we squeezed that maybe we cant get done now and is that in the best interest of the people were serving i dont think so
5668643 there were points that werent completely negotiated and there was all of this political pressure put on every member of the board
5668644 the commission as a body does a pretty good job of controlling its emotions but this one meeting got absolutely out of hand
5668645 i dont think you want people rubber stamping deals or mindlessly blocking deals i think you want to have that debate
5668646 right now it just feels like were so darn close to gridlock here that i hope somebodys thinking just planning ahead
5668647 the people of glendale are missing out on a tremendous opportunity to provide housing thats affordable for most of the people in the city of glendale
5668648 that would not go over very well because i think the developers would just be very very opposed to that
5668649 were having a hard time getting them to pay a couple thousand per unit for our parks
5668650 work force housing sort of gets ignored and overlooked because its those folks who they do have jobs theyre productive but their income levels are not such that would permit them to live in glendale
5668651 we want our teachers our nurses our firefighters to live in glendale
5668652 of course this whole business with real estate is not helping at all
5668653 interest rates are high and theres a lot of foreclosure so people are not buying anything new and the developers frankly are very nervous
5668654 hopefully youll see more new and exciting restaurants entertainment venues
5668655 i can see a lot of positive momentum being built up
5668656 there has not been a lot of new housing thats been built in the city of glendale so its not as if there is a glut on the market already
5668657 the demand for electric power rises nearly 2 for every degree fahrenheit the daily maximum temperature rises
5668658 the demand for electric power rises nearly 2 for every degree fahrenheit the daily maximum temperature rises
5668659 i concentrate on the individual how they live in the community and how they work in the community
5668660 speak at the level of the everyday person walking along the street theyll recognize themselves in the work and recognize their own community in the work
5668661 i think people who look at this will see themselves in it
5668662 slobodan is embedded in the community in terms of his work he was a pretty obvious choice
5668663 then we have to live with egg on our face for 30 years
5668664 he understands industrial work and has always stayed true to the theme of workers
5668665 someone came up to me the other day and asked if there is a way to do more of them
5668666 another one this isnt that tired old tale about the days before the iphone when you had to exert a heinous amount of thumb pressure to send text messages is it
5668667 or the one when grandma caught you downloading bikini models
5668668 no no little ones grandpa has a story about one of the most electrifying moments in the history of the little hometown hamlet we call los angeles
5668669 aw jeez that sounds excruciating let me guess olvera street fires condo conversions blah blah blah cant you just tell the bikini story again
5668670 now then i want to take you back to the year 2007 late july hot dry not a hint of a breeze hold on a moment that was january ditto february and march in fact the last time anyone alive that year recalled measurable rain falling mayor villaraigosa still had his wedding ring on
5668671 thats right young man now then during this rather typical summer a momentous event occurred that shook this city to its core changed everything overnight a miracle no one ever looked at downtown los angeles the same way again
5668672 i know what it was i know what it was
5668673 the year 2007 was when david beckham came to town with his really hot wife posh spice and a bunch of bratty british kids and started playing for the galaxy despite an ankle injury sustained while cashing oversized endorsement checks his debut changed l a forever and not just by giving once famous movie actress jennifer love hewitt a reason to go to carson am i right grandpa am i
5668674 wasnt posh spice the one that dated mayor villa whatchamacallit grandpa
5668675 no little girl that was another very beautiful and famous woman named mirthala salinas
5668676 and she had relationships with some other politicians too huh grandpa
5668677 thats right for a while there it appeared this woman dated every l a power broker including sam yorty
5668678 nope are you ready kids it was the opening of the downtown ralphs
5668679 which one grandpa there are six of them downtown now not to mention about a hundred pinkberrys
5668680 yeah grandpa but not a single trader joes why does mean ol trader joe hate us will we ever get to buy peanut butter filled pretzels like the people in silver lake and pasadena get to do
5668681 yeah and those two dollar bottles of tjs wine to lug up to the hollywood bowl
5668682 those are all good questions kids we can only hope anyway this first ralphs on ninth and flower brought new life to downtown residents they had looked forward to this occasion for years in fact more than a thousand people lined up around the block on the first day awaiting their chance to step inside these folks were more excited than michael vick at a dogfight
5668683 but why grandpa didnt downtown l a have other supermarkets
5668684 not like this ralphs was the areas first big time mainstream market to open in 57 years until then downtown residents had to either shop at smaller markets or head out of the area altogether to fulfill their god given right to buy yams greeting cards vegetables acne cream and pork loins all in the same bright happy place
5668685 thats right son the lack of a market left many downtown residents puzzled depressed and trying to explain to curious visitors why they dropped a half million dollars on a condo when they had to take a nasty time consuming car trip to pick up some decent crackers and cheez whiz many wondered how this might begin to affect the ol loft resale value when the real estate market cooled down not to mention the bloggers who pleaded nay demanded that someone anyone open a big happy market like all the other zip codes had
5668686 like it was yesterday there i was walking down flower turning the corner onto ninth and just standing there slack jawed stunned at this wondrous sight the likes of which i had never witnessed in all my years downtown
5668687 yes and for that instant downtown l a felt vibrant and alive on a sunny weekend afternoon and not like some dysfunctional little slice of urban america endlessly awaiting the next in what had been a long line of rebirths and everyone seemed content the shoppers the visitors the bloggers
5668688 amazing what rice krispies and radishes can do for a community
5668689 and dog food and gummy bears and toothbrushes and ice cream
5668690 and sandwiches and magazines and ointments galore i tell you children this was a downtown moment to remember
5668691 you can ask him yourself little girl next time youre in pinkberry hell be the one making your green tea smoothie
5668692 youre welcome tomorrow night ill tell you how posh wound up running the lausd goodnight kids
5668693 are only the latest move toward the manhattanization of los angeles
5668694 its hard to imagine two cities in the nation any more diametrically opposite
5668695 something has to be done with the infrastructure of l a to get cars off the road
5668696 they have to make it like new york where its not just poor people who take the bus
5668697 this is new construction its cleaner and i knew it was going to grow a lot quicker than the historic core because they were starting from scratch
5668698 it feels like we are on the forefront of something really cool thats happening
5668699 if you are a developer today and you are building in an area like that if you dont think about the street scaping and the neighborhood you are nuts
5668700 people are buying not just an apartment but a neighborhood everything within a quarter mile a five minute walk is as important as the countertops in their kitchens its an extension of their environment
5668701 a lot of people want an area thats less fringey
5668702 they are willing to pay more to buy into an area that is already established and has stuff to do and restaurants nearby
5668703 it might look quite sanitized and manufactured its certainly not authentic but at the same time its marketable
5668704 is it a neighborhood in the old sense of the word where you know your neighbors and can borrow a bottle of milk from them no probably not that doesnt come simply through design and wider sidewalks
5668705 to be in an area i knew a place that you knew was growing quickly and would go up in value
5668706 instead of looking old and urban its new and urban
5668707 they had a dream and they had mr anschutzs money
5668708 they never gave up and i am so glad we believed in their dream
5668709 the people who care about downtown l a have been waiting for these ordinances for a long time
5668710 i see it as creating a neighborhood where parking is horrendous and families are squeezing themselves into these units which are very small because they are affordable
5668711 i maxed out every inch of the wall space mounted everything to get it off the floor every new yorker is continually purging stuff because they dont have room
5668712 mine is a tiny place not somewhere you would want to entertain or bring people
5668713 its like a poor man penthouse you cant really be proud of it
5668714 only the most adventurous would do the very small units
5668715 that wouldnt be much more than a bathroom and 10 by 10 bedroom
5668716 youre creating tiny spaces that people live in for short periods of time
5668717 they say that in new york and san francisco people live in small apartments a long time well downtown l a youre not new york and youre not san francisco
5668718 urbanists can walk or take a bike to restaurants pick up their newspaper downstairs but dont have to deal with the inconveniences of downtown blight
5668719 theres been a sea change in preference from product to place
5668720 these are educated sophisticated buyers who want to connect with neighbors
5668721 they care about the lifestyle not which counter tops and flooring theyre getting
5668722 across demographics people of all ages living in large homes in spread out neighborhoods said they dont like it
5668723 not just the 500 friends on myspace we want to actually live close to our friends
5668724 weve always been adamant about living in or very near the city
5668725 we work a lot and in our time off it feels like were in a hotel we have a real connection to the city
5668726 people who love the loft look but dont want downtown l a
5668727 i gave up on every other place i was looking at
5668728 its the exact location price and eclectic group i like
5668729 in the 1950s the american dream was leave it to beaver
5668730 today its friends seinfeld and greys anatomy we like to be around people
5668731 its the endless challenge for anybody who does work from home
5668732 we are all sort of struggling with what the rules are
5668733 i really like the ability to live and work in the same place
5668734 downtown l a is a concentration of artists and free thinkers
5668735 more and more urban developers are seeing this market niche and are moving to fill it
5668736 the moment i found out i could purchase my actual building the light bulb went on
5668737 make sure you have all the appropriate licenses and keep good records
5668738 developers seem to think that people who work at home dont enjoy cooking
5668739 the kitchens are usually stuck in a corner with no window
5668740 so many things are converging to make live work practical
5668741 i drive so little that my lease guy is completely going to laugh at me when i turn my car in
5668742 frees up your life to do so many more quality things
5668743 we need to be embracing that density that mix of residences services and workplaces libraries and schools in one area
5668744 chris is an innovative creative architect who has his pulse on the community and the wherewithal to make things happen
5668745 the citys general plan is a good plan that strikes a balance between homeowners and developers
5668746 i find his total and unmitigated dismissal of the general plan quite scary given his considerable political clout
5668747 he is politically savvy he has a track record when he goes and works there is a certain trust that translates into results
5668748 i learned that it was the lifeblood of southern california
5668749 i am a member of the cabinet but not necessarily everyone knows me by name
5668750 but chris pak everybody knows him he gets better discounts than i do chris is amazing
5668751 a true metropolis where people can live work shop entertain eat and do all of it without having to get in your car
5668752 l a was zoned for vehicles in the early 1900s not for pedestrians and public transportation
5668753 it is still public land with restraints on it by a for profit development even though the park will be operated by a non profit that will control the parks operations and restraints not the developer
5668754 the developers pay the city and county rent for the park space
5668755 without a series of variances and approvals we asked for the project wound not have been able to be built
5668756 this will capitalize on the economic opportunity that downtown has presented
5668757 its another vehicle to get affordable housing and for the developer to get more floor area space
5668758 this is saying that downtown is a unique urban setting and that the codes as they are dont work for it
5668759 these are also things that we routinely grant to developers but now instead of having people go through the bureaucratic hoops well codify the process
5668760 our housing supply in los angeles is not growing at the rate it needs to grow to accommodate the population
5668761 we need to unshackle density and allow the market to start doing what it needs to do
5668762 right now one of the biggest markets is the 350 000 range if you want to tap into that and can solve a way to do that you will have a market for it
5668763 unfortunately that could mean smaller units but thats what you have to do to make it work in that price range
5668764 when the city uses zoning power to allow bigger buildings that is when they should say they want affordable housing in exchange for it because that is when they are creating value for the project
5668765 we dont need to incentivize market rate housing we need to incentivize affordable housing
5668766 it gets them the same thing at a cheaper price without requiring the affordable housing units
5668767 if its a better deal than what the developers would normally do then they will do it
5668768 but if its not they will decide not to do the project at all
5668769 the people who care about downtown l a have been waiting for these ordinances for a long time
5668770 were going from a market that was red hot fueled by easy lending that is now basically stone cold
5668771 the longer we see huge declines in sales and an increase in foreclosures the more likely thats going to impact housing prices
5668772 appreciation rates for most of that period were in the double digits and lenders let many households stretch their finances to the max and beyond
5668773 its that pool of beyond mortgages that the market is working its way through
5668774 the coastal areas will feel pain but it wont be as intense as the inland empire
5668775 its a scary situation and it would be horrifying if your economy is struggling but your local economy is doing well
5668776 this is new construction its cleaner and i knew it was going to grow a lot quicker than the historic core because they were starting from scratch
5668777 it feels like we are on the forefront of something really cool thats happening
5668778 if you are a developer today and you are building in an area like that if you dont think about the street scaping and the neighborhood you are nuts
5668779 people are buying not just an apartment but a neighborhood everything within a quarter mile a five minute walk is as important as the countertops in their kitchens its an extension of their environment
5668780 a lot of people want an area thats less fringey
5668781 they are willing to pay more to buy into an area that is already established and has stuff to do and restaurants nearby
5668782 it might look quite sanitized and manufactured its certainly not authentic but at the same time its marketable
5668783 is it a neighborhood in the old sense of the word where you know your neighbors and can borrow a bottle of milk from them no probably not that doesnt come simply through design and wider sidewalks
5668784 to be in an area i knew a place that you knew was growing quickly and would go up in value
5668785 instead of looking old and urban its new and urban
5668786 they had a dream and they had mr anschutzs money
5668787 they never gave up and i am so glad we believed in their dream
5668788 every new structure which projects into new fields of magnitude involves new problems for the solution of which neither theory nor practical experience furnish an adequate guide it is then that we must largely rely on judgment and if as a result errors or failures occur we must accept them as a price for human progress
5668789 increasing demand for condominium housing in downtown l a is beginning to positively affect average prices paid per square foot

5668849 despite the growth of smartphones such as rims blackberry and apples iphone
5668850 let people watch videos listen to music surf the internet and check e mail
5668851 finally giving in to the fanatical iphone fad i reluctantly walked into an apple store two weeks ago and bought the highly coveted 3g smart phone
5668852 clueless of my betrayal my loyal blackberry was joyfully bouncing in my purse unaware that it would soon be replaced by a newer prettier trendier apple phone
5668853 a hardcore blackberry fan since early on i resisted the first wave of iphone lovers oohs and aahs joining instead with the contemptuous crowds who criticized its useless keyboard its short battery life and general frailty i know at least a half dozen friends and family who had their phone replaced or repaired more than once during the year or so that theyve proudly owned it
5668854 if anything this knowledge should have made me wiser and more appreciative of the reliable blackberry that never failed me despite numerous little dives in bath water or falls from high tables but no trends are more powerful than common sense and how could i possibly resist a smart phone that looked like a piece of jewelry promised fast web browsing through 3g a gps option and access to countless enticing downloadable applications some for free
5668855 farewell 3g gps and applications galore hello bright white screen of death
5668856 i used every trick known in the repair book for desperate iphone users to revive it but nothing worked
5668857 three days without a phone was more than i could ever tolerate
5668858 videos posted on youtube show many variations of the white theme and specialists are all out speculating whether it is a software or hardware issue i could care less i feel like a fraud and wish i had never joined the rejoicing fanatical apple crowd
5668859 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
5668860 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
5668861 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
5668862 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
5668863 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
5668864 i am an extremist and not a fundamentalist my actions were never religion based the atrocities against the muslims in the country and the rest of the world angered me the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots were turning points

5668902 seorang pun tak mengetahui apa yang disembunyikan untuk mereka yaitu
5668903 sesungguhnya jika salah seorang dari kalian meninggal dunia maka kursinya diperlihatkan kepadanya setiap pagi dan petang jika ia penghuni surga maka ia adalah penghuni surga jika ia penghuni neraka maka ia adalah penghuni neraka kemudian dikatakan inilah kursimu hingga allah taala membangkitkanmu pada hari kiamat nanti
5668904 jibril berjalan terus hingga tiba di sidratul muntaha dan ternyata sidratul muntaha ditutup dengan warna yang tidak aku ketahui
5668905 kemudian aku masuk ke dalam surga dan ternyata di dalamnya terdapat kubah dari mutiara dan tanahnya beraroma kesturi
5668906 dan orang orang yang bertaqwa kepada rabbnya dibawa ke dalam surga berombong rombongan
5668907 kesejahteraan dilimpahkan atas kalian berbahagialah kalian maka masukilah surga ini sedang kalian kekal di dalamnya
5668908 yaitu surga aden yang pintu pintunya terbuka bagi mereka didalamnya mereka bertelekan di atas dipan dipan sambil meminta buah buahan yang banyak dan minuman di surga tersebut
5668909 di surga terdapat delapan pintu ada pintu yang namanya ar rayyan yang hanya dimasuki oleh orang orang yang puasa
5668910 barang siapa yang berinfak dengan sepasang unta atau kuda atau lainnya di jalan allah swt
5668911 siapa di antara kalian yang berwudhu kemudian menyempurnakan wudhunya lalu membaca asyhadu an laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahulaa syarikalahu wa asyhadu anna muhammadan abduhu warasuluhu maka dibukakan baginya pintu pintu surga yang berjumlah delapan dan ia masuk dari mana saja yang ia sukai
5668912 jika seorang muslim mempunyai tiga orang anak yang belum baligh kemudian meninggal dunia maka mereka menjumpainya di pintu pintu surga yang delapan dan ia bebas masuk dari pintu mana saja yang ia sukai
5668913 demi muhammad yang jiwanya ada di tangan nya jarak antara dua daun pintu surga adalah seperti makkah dan hajar atau hajar dan makkah
5668914 kalian adalah penyempurna tujuh puluh umat kalian adalah umat yang terbaik dan termulia di sisi allah jarak di antara dua daun pintu surga adalah empat puluh tahun pada suatu hari ia akan penuh sesak
5668915 pintu yang dimasuki oleh penghuni surga jaraknya adalah sejauh perjalanan pengembara dunia yang ahli tiga kali lipat kemudian penghuni surga memenuhinya hingga pundak mereka nyaris lengkap
5668916 pergilah dan ucapkan salam kepada sekumpulan tersebut mereka adalah para malaikat yang sedang duduk duduk dan mendengarkan salam yang mereka sampaikan kepadamu karena salam tersebut adalah salammu dan salam anak keturunanmu
5668917 maka setiap orang yang masuk ke dalam surga wajahnya seperti wajah adam dan postur tubuhnya adalah enam puluh hasta setelah adam manusia mengecil hingga sekarang
5668918 penghuni surga masuk ke dalam surga dengan rambut pendek belum berjenggot matanya bercelak dan usianya tiga puluh tiga tahun
5668919 jika penghuni surga meninggal dunia baik pada saat kecil atau tua maka mereka dikembalikan dengan usia tiga puluh tahun di surga dan usianya tidak bertambah selama lamanya begitu juga penghuni neraka
5668920 penghuni surga masuk surga dengan ketinggian adam enam puluh hasta dengan ukuran orang besar dengan wajah tampan setampan nabi yusuf seusia nabi isa tiga puluh tiga tahun lidahnya fasih sefasih nabi muhammad belum berjenggot dan berambut pendek
5668921 sesungguhnya derajat penghuni surga yang paling rendah yang berada di tingkat keenam dan ketujuh disediakan baginya tiga ratus pelayan yang setiap pagi dan sore melayaninya dengan memberikan tiga ratus piring yang saya ketahui piring tersebut terbuat dari emas
5668922 setiap piring mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh piring yang lain ia menikmati dari piring yang pertama hingga piring terakhir pelayan pelayan juga memberikan tiga ratus minuman di mana setiap minuman mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh tempat minum yang lain ia menikmati tempat minum pertama hingga tempat minum terakhir
5668923 sesungguhnya ia mempunyai istri sebanyak tujuh puluh dua orang yang berasal dari wanita wanita surgawi yang matanya cantik jelita belum temasuk istri istrinya dari wanita dunia
5668924 dan penghuni surga yang paling tinggi atau mulia di sisi allah adalah orang yang melihat wajah allah setiap pagi dan petang
5668925 wajah wajah orang orang mukmin pada saat itu berseri seri kepada rabbnyalah mereka melihat
5668926 saya memang diperintah agar pintu surga ini tidak saya buka sebelum anda terlebih dulu masuk
5668927 jibril datang kepada saya dan memberi informasi tentang pintu surga yang akan dimasuki oleh umatku
5668928 ya rasulullah saw aku ingin bersamamu hingga dapat melihat pintu surga
5668929 engkau wahai abu bakar adalah orang pertama dari umatku yang memasuki surga
5668930 mereka berbaris dalam satu regu wajah mereka memancarkan kepuasan seperti rembulan saat pertama tubuh mereka bersih dari kotoran tidak meludah tidak berdahak dan tidak pula buang air tempat tempat singgahnya terbuat dari emas sisirnya terbuat juga dari emas dan perak tempat apinya adalah kayud keringatnya berupa minyak misyk setiap lelaki memiliki pasangan istri yang kulitnya cemerlang seolah olah sumsumnya tampak dari balik daging mereka tidak pernah berselisih tidak saling membenci sebab mereka sehati bacaannya tiap kali adalah tasbih setiap pagi maupun sore
5668931 pasti masuk surga di antara umatku yang berjumlah tujuh puluh ribu orang tanpa hisab atau tujuh ratus ribu orang mereka saling bergandeng hingga masuk surga semuanya wajah mereka seperti rembulan pada saat pertama
5668932 semua umat diperlihatkan kepadaku kemudian aku lihat ada nabi yang diikuti oleh sekelompok orang pengikutnya
5668933 ini adalah umatmu dan di antara mereka ada tujuh puluh ribu orang yang masuk surga tanpa dihisab dan disiksa setelah itu rasulullah masuk ke dalam rumah
5668934 sementara orang orang sibuk membicarakan siapa sebenarnya mereka yang masuk ke dalam surga tanpa hisab dan tanpa disiksa sebagian mereka berkata
5668935 barangkali mereka adalah yang dilahirkan dalam keadaan islam dan tidak menyekutukan allah dengan sesuatupun
5668936 berdoalah kepada allah agar ia menjadikan aku di antara mereka
5668937 aku tahu orang terakhir yang ke luar dari neraka dan terakhir masuk surga ia ke luar dari neraka sambil merangkak lalu allah berfirman kepadanya
5668938 pergilah dan masuklah ke dalam surga sebab di sana tidak seperti di dunia melainkan sepuluh kali dunia
5668939 apakah engkau ejek aku atau engkau tertawakan aku sedang engkau adalah raja
5668940 apakah engkau masih ingat setiap orang berada di rumahnya sendiri sendiri

5669037 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5669038 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5669039 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5669040 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5669041 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5669042 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

5669143 there is safety in information parents and students need to know that college campuses are doing all they can to keep students safe we must take every step possible to prevent a tragedy like the seton hall fire from ever happening again i am glad our bill is now law so we can finally give the public the information it needs to evaluate fire safety at colleges and universities
5669144 i am pleased that our work to close a dangerous public safety loophole at college campuses all over the nation has finally paid off if these common sense fire safety disclosure requirements were in place years ago lives may have been saved and perhaps fewer families and classmates would have experienced the horrific shock and pain that overwhelmed the seton hall community in 2000
5669145 college students should be thinking about their futures and not worried about losing their lives
5669146 we want to keep them safe and to avoid catastrophic tragedies like the one we experienced in new jersey it is important to arm them with all of the information we can so students and their families can make informed choices as to which colleges and universities are safest

5669151 technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5669152 adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5669153 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern

5669157 im now in the process of trying to send out questionnaires to young stroke survivors to identify specifically their unique needs
5669158 although stroke is the third leading cause of death and the number one cause of adult disability people tend to be uninformed about strokes and life after stroke the support groups offer an opportunity for people to share their experiences and learn from one another about coping with the changes taking place in their lives
5669159 our stroke support group community is like a big family where people network and support each other and the young persons support group has been phenomenal
5669160 as a result of these findings we are in the process of developing a cardiac fitness index to be released later this year that will help trainers and coaches understand how cardiac conditions impact performance of high endurance athletes
5669161 our work also will provide healthcare professionals with insight into new more effective ways of assessing and treating heart disease for the general public
5669162 i fully support the action to have preparticipation cardiovascular screening mandatory for elite athletes this will evaluate athletes before participating in sports for the purpose of identifying or raising suspicion of abnormalities that could provoke disease progression or sudden cardiac death ensuring the well being of all athletes is the iocs priority and we feel that the identification of the relevant diseases will allow clinicians to make decisions earlier on of whether a player can stay in the game or not but above all tailor their training programs to best meet their needs and ensure athlete safety
5669163 we were surprised to find that athletes who trained at the highest level with no sign of pain showed early signs of potential injury during routine scanning
5669164 weve found that ultrasound technology can highlight problems with structure and with mobility of tissues that no other examination technique can show
5669165 we train so hard as athletes that little injuries can lead to further injuries
5669166 through these routine scans we can know if we should sit out but if we know that we can keep going we can train at the highest level
5669167 if we can move toward predictive healthcare and early detection of disease we have the potential to dramatically reduce the risks of late stage disease treatment
5669168 shifting resources to develop technologies that allow healthcare providers to diagnose disease at the earliest possible stage when there can be many treatment options is better medicine

5669179 as far as the gulf region is concerned we are aware that india receives sizeable remittances from this part of the world which basically goes into consumer spending
5669180 one of the primary objectives of oifc would be to convert these remittances into actual investments
5669181 what is clear from the results is that these patients could do as well or better in a less restrictive environment
5669182 this raises an important question about why people in mental health crisis need to be committed to a large expensive and locked inpatient facility when a small well run consumer managed program can work as well or better
5669183 people get the sense that they are being listened to and because we staff our facility with people who are in recovery they can transmit a greater sense of compassion and provide a model for how to get through i think this plays well for peoples hopes that they can recover
5669184 what i hope people will gain from this study is an understanding that crisis residential programs can work and do work crps are a valuable component of a mental health treatment system
5669185 we are trying to obtain the evidence based data to substantiate what consumers are telling us about the value of these types of services
5669186 these findings have reinforced these perceptions and those held by policy makers and administrators that peer managed services are key to mental health transformation
5669187 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5669188 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5669189 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5669190 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5669191 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5669192 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5669193 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5669194 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5669195 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5669196 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5669197 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5669198 the traditional artificial hip is based on a mans anatomy women are built differently than men
5669199 women tend to be shorter than men more petite and have smaller bones and shorter hips
5669200 knee implants have been functioning very well for men and women but we wanted to meet womens unique needs by making knee replacements that feel fit and function even better
5669201 the implant is the best of both worlds its based on the current implant we use a highly successful implant with great mechanics and 10 years of clinical success only the shape of this new implant is different to make it feel more natural
5669202 the availability of implants in a wide variety of shapes and sizes will help us provide a more patient specific approach for all patients
5669203 its a compliment for swansea city because i dont think many people would have paid a transfer fee to get a player in league two to be a manager in league one

5669210 the number of medical graduates in australia is projected to increase from 1 200 in 2002 to 3 000 by 2012
5669211 already we are feeling the pinch of increased medical student numbers with students being forced to deal with reduced hours of teaching fewer resources and difficulties accessing infrastructure the introduction of a new model of practitioner into the fold will further limit the clinical training resources for medical students
5669212 trainee physician assistants will reduce the access of medical students and junior doctors to patients and clinicians to the detriment of their medical education and therefore future patient care
5669213 once these physician assistants are trained there will be nothing to stop them taking up posts in metropolitan hospitals there are absolutely no guarantees that physician assistants will practice in rural and remote areas
5669214 instead of spending millions of dollars on creating a new model of healthcare practitioner for which there is no evidence of cost effectiveness we must focus on improving and expanding programs that promote rural retention
5669215 the study demonstrates and confirms an increased frequency of rejection reactions among patients who test positive with xm one even in cases where conventional lymphocyte cross match tests are unsuccessful in detecting donor specific antibodies prior to now we have not been able to be sure that we could detect these important non hla anti bodies
5669216 the study shows that we now with xm one easily can get access to donor cells that allow detection of non hla anti bodies this in turn improves donor recipient pairing and kidney transplantation outcome
5669217 the study is a first step in building up a scientific knowledge base about and clinical acceptance of xm one the work has awakened great scientific interest and several other transplantation centers want to conduct their own independent trials with xm one
5669218 xm one provides key previously unattainable information about donor recipient compatibility that increases the probability of a successful transplantation xm one opens up completely new possibilities for detecting antibodies that we previously were unable to identify
5669219 using xm one we can now identify the extent of clinical problems related to anti endothelium cell antibodies in patients undergoing transplantations

5669221 fifa today decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for september 6 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5669222 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5669223 the georgian football federation has until august 26 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of september 6 2008 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match

5669239 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
5669240 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
5669241 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
5669242 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
5669243 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
5669244 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
5669245 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
5669246 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease
5669247 alterations in brain serotonin levels have been linked to several mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety
5669248 however despite the prevalence of postpartum depression and the frequent use of serotonergic drugs such as zoloft to treat this disorder a requirement for maternal serotonin function in the mothers behavior toward her offspring had not been convincingly demonstrated until now
5669249 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5669250 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5669251 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5669252 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5669253 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5669254 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5669255 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
5669256 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5669257 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5669258 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5669259 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5669260 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to 9 decades after exposure
5669261 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus
5669262 the advantage of ercs is that they can be used in an off the shelf manner meaning they can be delivered to the point of care do not require matching and are easily injectable without the need for complex equipment
5669263 we are proud of assembling such a strong clinically experienced team to contribute to these studies
5669264 dr ewa carrier and suman kambhampati are hematologists who use stem cells on a regular basis dr angle is a vascular surgeon who like dr murphy sees cli on a daily basis and dr amit patel has performed numerous cardiac stem cell clinical trials with such a team that understands not only the science but also the practical implementation we feel we are well positioned to translate this discovery into a practical therapy in the near future
5669265 so far a lot of experiments have been carried out with optical techniques that are sometimes difficult to integrate in a complete system the new nanostructures we envisage will make it possible for us to miniaturize systems even further and to develop commercially feasible equipment

5669375 el 90 de lo que se encuentra en internet es basura
5669376 empec sin tener mucha idea y acud hace unos meses al encuentro de blogueros en sevilla que parec a una secta pero pronto me puse las pilas y aprend a manejar las herramientas
5669377 al final te encuentras a los mismos participando en todos lados
5669378 al final el c rculo se cierra y somos los mismos comentando en los distintos blogs de gente de la ciudad con gustos similares
5669379 yo leo unos 15 al d a sobre tecnolog a de expertos y profesionales inform ticos adem s de cosas locales de mi pueblo y de mis amigos
5669380 tener diez comentarios al d a es un orgullo y me motiva a continuar ya que son lectores asiduos y fieles
5669381 mi blog no tendr a sentido sin los enlaces de otros blogueros a diario aprendo mucho sobre m sica cl sica semana santa y sobre formas de escribir y de expresarse y de gente que no conozco en persona
5669382 empec de forma an nima para probar pero luego ya puse mi nombre
5669383 un d a me di cuenta de que deb a tener cuidado porque mucha gente lo ve a incluso en las entrevistas de trabajo a las que iba
5669384 las revistas de coches viven de la publicidad y son moderados pero los blogs viven del usuario y opinan libremente incluso mal
5669385 puedo expresarme y hacer lo que me gusta busco temas menos convencionales e intento ser original ya que adem s me documento a trav s de manuales pero tambi n soy exigente y le busco la l gica a lo que publico
5669386 dieses ehrgeizige projekt sprengt den rahmen einer diplomarbeit deutlich da die beiden studierenden nicht nur ein engagiertes innovatives konzept entwickelt haben sondern ber das bliche planen und modellbauen hinaus einen fertigen prototypen pr sentieren
5669387 zudem ist das projekt endlich ein versuch sich von der vorstellung zu befreien dass wohnanh nger immer gleich aussehen m ssen blicherweise ist es nur die farbe der textilien ab nun l sst sich die gesamte konfiguration des fahrzeuges individuell gestalten
5669388 unser konzept orientiert sich an der bionik und nimmt bewusst anleihen aus der natur
5669389 wir wollten mit unserer idee zeigen dass es auch anders geht jeder wohnwagen ist ein unikat
5669390 the advantage of ercs is that they can be used in an off the shelf manner meaning they can be delivered to the point of care do not require matching and are easily injectable without the need for complex equipment
5669391 we are proud of assembling such a strong clinically experienced team to contribute to these studies
5669392 dr ewa carrier and suman kambhampati are hematologists who use stem cells on a regular basis dr angle is a vascular surgeon who like dr murphy sees cli on a daily basis and dr amit patel has performed numerous cardiac stem cell clinical trials with such a team that understands not only the science but also the practical implementation we feel we are well positioned to translate this discovery into a practical therapy in the near future
5669393 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5669394 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5669395 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5669396 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5669397 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
5669398 durch das vermischen der genome kann es zur ausbildung von genotypen kommen die unter umst nden besser an die umweltbedingungen angepasst sind als die der beiden interagierenden elternarten
5669399 we are interested in the design thinking method of innovation which has been successfully taught at both institutions through joint scientific research projects we want to find out which factors ultimately contribute to the success of this kind of engineered and creative development of innovation for all areas of life
5669400 as engineers we strive to apply basic scientific discoveries in ways that will meet human needs improving our understanding of that innovation process will help us bring better solutions to society more quickly
5669401 together with our colleagues from stanford university we are also going to probe how such innovation processes which are brought forth by small multidisciplinary teams could be further improved and developed
5669402 the time is right to apply rigorous academic research to understand how when and why design thinking works to accelerate human centered innovation
5669403 it is time to create the next generation design thinking methodology and supporting technology and we appreciate professor plattners support of this endeavour
5669404 wenn die studien erfolgreich verlaufen k nnen wir auf v llig neue therapieans tze zugreifen
5669405 die wenigstens patienten sp ren einen zu hohen bluthochdruck meist erst wenn er extrem hoch ist
5669406 nur etwa ein viertel der patienten ist medikament s gut eingestellt
5669407 bei einem weiteren viertel ist der bluthochdruck diagnostiziert die patienten sind aber nicht ausreichend mit medikamenten versorgt bei einem viertel ist die hypertonie zwar diagnostiziert die patienten werden aber nicht therapiert und schlie lich ist bei einem viertel der betroffenen der bluthochdruck berhaupt nicht diagnostiziert
5669408 bei den meisten hypertonie patienten sind allerdings keine eindeutigen ursachen f r zu hohen blutdruck zu finden
5669409 erstmals wird jetzt das gesamte genom der betroffenen auf ver nderungen untersucht
5669410 wir messen ob im blut freie sauerstoffradikale eiwei e angegriffen haben
5669411 die bei uns gefundenen ergebnisse korrelieren wir schlie lich mit den ergebnissen der genanalyse um so den m glichen hypertonie genen auf die spur zu kommen
5669412 wir implantieren ihn unter das schl sselbein und f hren die aktivierungsdr hte zu beiden halsschlagadern
5669413 das ger t sendet laufend elektroimpulse zu den halsschlagadern dort befinden sich nervenknoten die den blutdruck berwachen
5669414 das gehirn reagiert darauf und setzt k rpereigene mechanismen zur blutdrucksenkung in gang die gef e werden stark erweitert
5669415 bei einer patientin die die therapie mit f nf medikamenten nicht vertragen hatte konnte der blutdruck dauerhaft um 60 bis 70 mmhg verringert werden
5669416 die meisten patienten mit diesen extrem hohen werten m ssen zwar weiterhin medikamente nehmen doch dank der blutdrucksenkung mithilfe des schrittmachers ist die gefahr drastisch gesunken folgekrankheiten zu erleiden
5669417 dabei soll dann gezeigt werden dass die therapie mit dem schrittmacher nicht nur akut wirkt sondern auch chronisch
5669418 wenn die ergebnisse der auf ein jahr angelegten studie positiv sind k nnte der impfstoff bereits in vier jahren auf den markt kommen
5669419 unser ziel ist es mit der impfung medikamente zu ersetzen wir h tten dann eine ganz neue form der behandlung die patienten m ssten nicht regelm ig ihre medikamente einnehmen sondern w ren mit einer einzigen impfung f r einen l ngeren zeitraum gesch tzt
5669420 die wiederum fischen das im blut zirkulierende angiotensin ii weg
5669421 die sch digende wirkung des hormons das engstellen der gef e bleibt aus damit sinkt der blutdruck
5669422 eine blutdrucksenkung von bis zu 20 mmhg konnte nachgewiesen werden allerdings hielt der erfolg nur wenige monate an
5669423 die studienteilnehmer werden innerhalb von zw lf wochen f nfmal geimpft dabei wird die dosis gesteigert und ist am ende dreimal so hoch wie in der ersten studie
5669424 wir wollen eine dauerhaft gute blutdruckeinstellung erreichen ohne das weitere medikamente ben tigt werden

5669433 its a huge honour to be recognised this is double or 10 times more when you hear the names of those who have gone before you and the things they have achieved
5669434 the honour didnt hit me until i saw who i would be sharing the stage with today people like caryl parry jones and lord dafydd elis thomas i cant believe im being included among them
5669435 its really humbling to be in their number i was brought up an eisteddfodwr i used to compete in the urdd eisteddfod perhaps not as much as i should when i was young i used to compete or try to compete it had a big effect on me as a child

5669475 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three

5669477 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5669478 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5669479 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5669480 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

5669488 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft

5669490 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area

5669519 petroleum may be in short supply these days but the united states does have a related surplus myths of oil abundance you dont have to drill deep into our political discourse to find suspect stories about oil with politicians peddling the flagrantly false notion that china is producing oil off the coast of florida while right wing activist jerome corsi claims oil is not a fossil fuel but a natural product the earth generates constantly such declarations serve a political purpose to make oil drilling seem like an easy solution to our current energy crisis to marginalize warnings that we are running short on oil and to stymie efforts at conservation or developing alternatives to fossil fuels

5669541 firstly there needs to be an institutional and governance framework to ensure smooth transparent and effective decisions on the conduct of monetary policy and other central bank policies including the mode of operation of the gcc central bank inflation should be the priority item on the policy agenda there is need for a change in monetary policy towards inflation targeting with monetary policy geared to maintaining inflation within an announced target range the gcc countries will need to invest in building their statistical capacity in order to provide harmonized comparable economic and financial data to support the gmu and the gulf common market the gmu if it is to be achieved and serve its purpose needs to be supported by investments in financial infrastructure including legal and regulatory payment systems and the development and linkage of money markets and capital markets to ensure a uniform interest rate and the swift transfer of funds throughout the gcc
5669542 the gmu will strengthen the commitment of gcc countries to regional economic integration the gmu should be the central policy anchor extending the benefits of currency stability to financial markets industries and citizens by fostering more intense trade relationships linking the capital markets and attracting international capital
