7590091 we are waiting to know if something can interest us we have spoken about a possible signing but our coach can start the season in a relaxed mood because he trusts the squad he is in charge of
7590092 unfortunately i am a strong believer that had bill been around we would not have seen the performances that we have
7590093 he did not have good team management skills so one of the good things about this team was that they enjoyed being there they were united as a team
7590094 unfortunately bill did not create that atmosphere over the last eight years
7590095 at this very special moment for me i really want to send a message to the chelsea fans who in the past two years have always made me feel their support
7590096 there were other clubs but when my agent told me the gunners were interested that immediately became the priority for both me and my father
7590097 you just have to look at what the club has done in the last few years arsenal put a lot of faith in youth and all the french players who have come here have made an explosive impression
7590098 theres a guarantee with arsenal theyre a club synonymous with success and then theres mr wenger
7590099 it was very important to know i wasnt heading into the unknown i dont feel homesick at all you hear more french than english in the dressing room

7590104 if you told me today i could have the same career as him id sign up immediately with my eyes closed
7590105 at the time he was the best left sided midfielder in the world he scored and set up loads of goals we have pretty much the same characteristics instead of staying out on the wing he liked to come inside a lot
7590106 part of me wanted to move on to progress and raise my game

7590117 the issue of the sodomy allegations while it gained some traction at the beginning of the campaign by the end had reached saturation point and wont significantly affect his chances of winning
7590118 it is all barisan nasional propaganda we will vote for anwar god willing he will become the prime minister

7590126 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7590128 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority of those polled rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7590129 i will be telling my delegates that i will vote for barack obama
7590130 how they vote is a more personal decision they want to have their chance to vote for me that is what traditionally happens some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling them both ways

7590208 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes

7590210 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
7590211 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7590212 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

7590228 the terror group hamas tried to stage a media pr event and failed big time
7590229 we knew about this hamas attempt to create a pr event at sea for weeks we knew whos on these boats and what they contain and therefore we decided weeks ago to allow them to come into gaza they were not carrying weapons and had only a handful of equipment for the hearing impaired
7590230 one cannot place any responsibility on the palestinian authority for these theatrics as the pa has no control of gaza
7590231 supposed to have been brought in by the two palestine boats carrying international leftist activists who support hamas suicide bombers and rocket attacks on israel towns and cities
7590232 a complete and total disregard for innocent israel terror victims

7590364 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7590365 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself
7590366 as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7590367 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work
7590368 amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7590369 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop
7590370 the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
7590371 my position is that a sensible jury would not expect people to be sniffing talcum powder
7590372 prison has helped blake give up drugs and hes doing brilliantly in edmunds hill
7590373 when he went in pentonville last november he was in a terrible mess his skin was a horrible dirty yellow color he was painfully thin and he had dead eyes i will never forget that haunted look i feared we were going to lose him
7590374 but they gave him amazing medical treatment in prison to get him off drugs and then helped him conquer his personal demons
7590375 now nine months on he looks amazing he has put on nearly two stone in weight his skin is glowing with health and he is so relaxed and happy
7590376 but while blake has been inside amy has gone disastrously downhill
7590377 prison worked for blake its the only thing that can now save amy
7590378 blakes been given his own room with an ensuite shower
7590379 he also has a tv cd player and a shelf full of books in his room
7590380 he even has his own key so he can lock himself in if he wants privacy
7590381 its so much nicer than pentonville which was the pits
7590382 and the difference in blake since hes been in there is absolutely amazing
7590383 they are respectful and dont even mention her name to him
7590384 instead of doing work in prison blake has chosen to do an educational course to keep him busy and is doing art and writing
7590385 the video will come as a bitter blow to him
7590386 i hope this time it works but i have heard it so many times before i havent any faith in her
7590387 amy tried to get in to see blake last weekend but was turned away because she was too late
7590388 we didnt have a driver when we visited blake but she had a driver and she still couldnt turn up on time
7590389 blake was not impressed he is only allowed three visits a month
7590390 since blake has been in prison amy has just deteriorated more and more while he has managed to get himself clean inside
7590391 blake told me i promise you mum when i get out of prison i will sort amy out
7590392 but she has deteriorated to such an extent that i know even blake cant save her now
7590393 she needs to stay in there for the next four months until blake comes out of prison or be locked up in jail until she gets herself clean
7590394 blake hopes she will beat drugs for him and save their marriage
7590395 but its clear amy loves drugs more than her husband

7590398 given obamas reluctance to play the partisan card it should be fun having a real pit bull in the number two position to do some of the necessary dirty work
7590399 theres more than a small risk that biden will reinforce the sense that this ticket is all about hearing itself talk
7590400 im not a big fan of biden for a variety of reasons but for a variety of other reasons i think hes a pretty good vp choice not my fantasy vp choice or close to it but nonetheless pretty good better than many of the other floated names
7590401 i think this is a decent choice especially given the alternatives bayh shudder
7590402 all things being equal obama could have done a whole lot worse
7590403 hes a good pick for the campaign bidens got a certain appeal to older white voters and working class voters that we in the new progressive movement dont really get hes not from our world he was wrong on iraq and the bankruptcy bill and hes kind of a blowhard and dislikes the blogs he blames us for the clean articulate controversy hes bad on subscribes to the antiwar left not serious concept and he wants to keep residual troops in other words hes perfect for the obama campaign reinforcing their key frame of change but not scary liberal change bidens not a horrific pick hes fine considering the choices
7590404 biden wasnt my favorite choice for the gig but he was far from my least favorite choice either
7590405 biden is undisciplined and unpredictable but i have to tell you i think the obama campaign could use a little bit of that at this point maybe it will shake things up its a good sign that they picked someone who wasnt completely safe they could have done a lot worse and if biden can speak the language of the working class dems even if his record speaks to the typical beltway fealty to big business then he is an asset
7590406 ideologically i disagree with biden on a number of issues but i can fully support this pick and i actually really like joe biden
7590407 the thing i like most about obama picking biden is hes got sharp elbows and hes not afraid to throw them
7590408 biden can be a partisan pit bull when so warranted given obamas reluctance to play the partisan card it should be fun having a real pit bull in the number two position to do some of the necessary dirty work
7590409 say what you will about biden but he is one tough son of a bitch he doesnt back down from a fight and he wont put up with the republicans bullshit he says exactly what he thinks which sometimes gets him into trouble with the traditional media and sometimes with the blogosphere but i admire the bluntness even when i think hes full of shit i think obama needs that toughness by his side
7590410 i think it is an outright terrible decision on obamas part to pick biden yes he helps balance obamas inexperience on foreign policy but he also reminds people of it yes biden could conceivably be effective as an attack dog but biden is such a gasbag he makes the hindenburg look like a sack of rocks obama doesnt need to increase his lip flapping quotient biden is a gaffe machine and obama is bad explaining faults and his vps faults will inevitably become obamas in the fall campaign theres more than a small risk that biden will reinforce the sense that this ticket is all about hearing itself talk
7590411 i am quite surprised nearly shocked at the pick of biden i believe obama has made an error not just hope so believe i dont see what biden gains him biden is a slightly risible figure what with his hair plugs or whatever and his many many examples of public obnoxiousness the verbiage ticket this is and the arrogance ticket and the emptiness ticket mccain and his running mate to be should really take them dont you think
7590412 i breathed a sigh of relief that obama chose biden like jay nordlinger i find that at best biden adds nothing to the democratic ticket rather than adding to obamas attractions or neutralizing obamas liabilities if he does anything biden subtracts from obamas strengths and contributes to his liabilities bidens selection undercuts obamas change mantra tending to reveal it as the kind of gasbaggery in which biden coincidentally has distinguished himself in the course of a long and otherwise undistinguished career
7590413 every republican operative ive talked to for the last week thought biden was the weakest pick hes a loose cannon who has already made several gaffes in the hall of fame of political screw ups that will now be rehashed for the next week obama needed somebody that was reliable and could potentially deliver a red state biden is neither obama may think biden shores up his own weakness on foreign policy but it just emphasizes it and given that most americans think economic issues are more important its less clear what biden delivers
7590414 not only has biden not helped obama it looks like hes actually damaging the ticket with his addition he certainly hasnt added any enthusiasm to the democratic offering did team obama do any serious research on biden and his effect before making this selection
7590415 with the addition of slow joe biden to the ticket obama has added to his unsteady candidacy an epic amount beltway cluelessness and arrogance unsupported by anything except frequent flier miles and delawares love for a chuckle headed fellow with a big smile
7590416 instead of reinforcing obamas message biden muddles it biden is the ultimate washington insider having been in the senate for 36 years he has hardly held a real job having been elected to the senate as a young attorney fresh out of law school in all likelihood the democratic ticket of obama biden will have more years in washington 38 than the mccain led republican ticket so much for hope and change
7590417 the blogger in me is happy to see someone biden get the nod because he is sure to say some controversial things in the weeks to come lets be honest the guy is a gaffe machine he has already driven two presidential campaigns into the ground with his mouth will this be the third
7590418 all in all biden is probably an inferior pick to someone like ex ga sen sam nunn or hillary clinton who would have delivered a lot more votes but he will help balance out obamas inexperience naivete and lack of competence which is what barack desperately needs right now
7590419 the view that the biden selection was poor because it undercuts obamas message as the agent of change is questionable obama i think has recognized that what worked when he was seeking the democratic nomination may not serve him well in the general election this is standard political calculation and very probably correct in this instance the presence of good ol joe of the ticket should be seen as an effort to reassure some of hillarys supporters as well as moderate voters that obama will not be the agent of radical change just the kind of mainstream liberal change the democrats traditionally advocate its an effort worth making whether biden proves to be the best vehicle for this undertaking is another matter
7590420 the difficulty for an obama biden ticket will be leveraging joe bidens assets without them turning into liabilities no thats not a dirty joke one of the benefits of choosing biden is that he is charismatic funny and can come across as a normal guy on the stump all problem areas for obama but the same shoot from the hip tendency has produced a long list of biden gaffes let biden be a loose canon and the obama camp will run into trouble rein him in too tightly and you might as well have picked ultra boring ks gov kathleen sebelius
7590421 republicans just spent months building up their obama is elitist narrative only to see it come crashing down under the weight of four seven eight who the heck knows how many houses and when i say who the heck knows i mean who the heck knows not even mccain knows and this is just getting started john mccain life and lifestyle keeps getting in the way of his campaigns best zingers they mock obamas visit to his grandmother in hawaii turns out mccain and cindy met in hawaii and then they honeymooned in hawaii exotic elitist blah blah blah its one big long season of the pot calling the kettle black
7590422 at the risk of jeopardizing a long long overdue media awakening and subsequent pile on given the material the press has had to work with its just a little weird that the number of houses fucking houses is what it took to even begin to reverse the ongoing media cranial rectal inversion on all matters mccain the right was scared and they should be for one fleeting instant the media reacted with a show of objectivity laced with deadly accuracy and the mccain mythos unraveled faster than a cheap ball of yarn in a room full of hyperactive kittens no doubt the press will soon revert to their old comfortable pattern where all news is good news for the mccain campaign
7590423 the way that mccain has been undermined by his own words on how he cant remember how many houses he owns was organized by the obama campaign and the new and enlarged dnc they pushed it out kept it going and managed the media cycle well importantly they moved away from their standard negative attack big oil to seize an opportunity to define mccains character the campaign did not do this on phil gramm s nation of whiners comment for instance but they did here and thats a very good sign
7590424 the houses gaffe exposes two of mccains biggest vulnerabilities 1 the contrast between his old soldier pseudo mystique and the pampered life hes led for almost 40 years and 2 the age related wobbliness which has his campaign aides keeping him largely off limits to the traveling press these dovetail with his loose cannon approach to critical foreign policy questions these issues particularly 2 and 3 are substantively critical issues 1 is to the extent that it sheds light on mccains general ignorance and indifference to bread n butter economic issues and his willingness to flip between progressive and bushite tax policy over the course of a couple years but the tempo of this election and the fall out from the celeb attacks will be determined in large part not by factual particulars but by whether obama can show that when someone hits him hard he hits back twice as hard not cowering ignoring or complaining this is about the score and not the libretto
7590425 the candidate of change went with the status quo in picking sen joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions
7590426 as recently as last year ron fournier considered instead he took a job as washington bureau chief for the ap but it looks like hes still working for mccain fournier say in a new ap piece that the biden choice demonstrates that obama lacks confidence that biden is the ultimate insider and that it threatens to undermine obamas message of change it couldve come straight off the fax machine of the mccain press shop with no need for editing indeed the mccain campaign says it loves the fournier piece its simply not acceptable that the head of the aps washington bureau in charge of presidential campaign coverage sees the ap as little more than an extension of the mccain campaigns message ron fournier must be taken off the presidential beat hes got an obvious conflict of interest
7590427 its going to be an awfully long fall campaign if the ap washington bureau under ron fournier insists on shoddy journalistic techniques and merely regurgitating the spin from the mccain campaign
7590428 it didnt really matter who obama selected fournier was going to make a case against them so while everyone else was waiting for their obama vp text fournier was receiving one from from karl rove
7590429 it seems to me that just as a matter of appearances allowing someone who negotiated for a job with one of the candidates to drive aps election coverage is imprudent the sycophantic emails from fournier to karl rove at the moment when as we now know rove was engaged in an especially ghoulish act of deception with the press as his instrument make things worse those suspicions might have slept if fournier and his colleagues had provided even reasonably even handed treatment of the candidates but the actual slant of aps presidential campaign coverage culminating in this mornings hit piece aimed at joe biden and at barack obama for choosing him is now too obvious to ignore
7590430 after their top presidential reporter ron fournier interviewed for a job with the mccain presidential campaign its simply abominable that ap would keep him on the presidential beat does anyone doubt that a mccain presidency will try to hire fournier for press secretary please its a given fournier will always have his next job in the back of his mind you simply dont even entertain a job offer from someone you cover if you intend to continue covering them we are far beyond the appearance of impropriety
7590431 ron fourniers dramatic use of opinion in the first paragraph of the biden story going out on all the wires is an aggressive republican spin fournier has already weakened the aps rep for pretty straight up reportage it just got a lot weaker last spring by the way fournier was lambasting obama for arrogance now apparently its a lack of confidence whatever works i guess but please get a blog
7590432 tell them that the publics faith in the 160 year old ap will be gone if ron fournier is allowed to continue his slanted articles against democrats and for mccain
7590433 one of the worst moments in the entire campaign for barack obama
7590434 my hunch is this is going to end up being one of the worst moments in the entire campaign for one of the candidates but its barack obama i believe that this opened the door to not just tony rezko in that ad but to bring up reverend jeremiah wright to bring up his relationship with bill ayers
7590435 its a very tough standard but i think this may be the stupidest thing halperin has ever said yes i know i know the mccain folks must be both loving and laughing at the guy at the same time shorter halperin if youre a democrat you really just better take it because the more you fight back the worse its gonna be for you
7590436 not only is this silly in a first order sense the underlying premises that a door needs to be opened for mccain to deploy those kind of attacks is bizarre
7590437 mcsame gets caught admitting he doesnt know how many freaking houses he owns a gaffe thats so monumental and politically damaging in an election when the economy will likely be the central issue it makes poppys grocery store moment seem mild in comparison and yet because obama mocked him for it obamas the one whos in trouble because darn it those oh so civil and respectful republicans that are notoriously hesitant to engage in negative political attacks finally get to play dirty unfuckingbelievable
7590438 mark halperin has outdone himself today claiming that the mccain housing gaffe is bad for obama no seriously for service to the cause it is with much pride that i award halperin the second golden mcpenis for meritorious service to mccains scrotum well done mark you earned it
7590439 im kind of surprised by the number of people im reading who seem convinced that joe biden would be too old to run for president in 2016 at the age of 74 john mccain is running for president right now at the age of 72 and though voters do seem to have some concerns about his age its hardly a crippling disadvantage whats more to the best of my knowledge biden unlike mccain doesnt have a history of cancer or physical ailments stemming from years of captivity and torture from an actuarial point of view biden at 74 will almost certainly have a longer life expectancy than mccain at 72 whats more given population trends the country as a whole will be older in 2016 than it is in 2008 obviously a million things could happen that prevent bidenmania from sweeping the country in 2016 but if obama wins two elections and biden stays in reasonable health big ifs i dont see whats stopping him from running

7590511 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
7590512 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
7590513 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
7590514 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
7590515 no i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff shes one of my best friends in the whole world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews we were staring at a post it with a smiley face so i think i probably rolled my eyes a hundred times just sitting there like oh gosh this thing is still going on

7590529 our extraordinary housing boom financed by very large increases in mortgage debt cannot continue indefinitely into the future
7590530 only when the tide goes out do you discover whos been swimming naked
7590531 this is an epic event were talking about the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went absolutely parabolic from 2001 2007
7590532 before the us economy can truly begin to expand again the savings rate must rise to pre bubble levels of 8pc that the us housing stocks must fall to below eight months supply and that the household interest coverage ratio must fall from 14pc to 10 5pc
7590533 its important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require we will probably have to eliminate 2 trillion of household debt to get there
7590534 we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations although our management believes that the incurrence of long term indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business
7590535 interest expense for 3 months ending june 30 2008 was 312 943 000 net income for 3 months ending june 30 2008 was 34 082 000 earnings per share from continuing operations was 01 earnings per share from discontinued operations was 12 if the cost to refinance 18 billion were to rise to 8 0 interest expense would rise by 50 to a whopping 469 414 000 per quarter even 7 would be a killer based on the numbers presented above

7590537 to let people know that the guard was here doing the job of keeping americans free and safe
7590538 while planning to go to ranger school in the fall of 2007 i was doing a twelve mile road march every month
7590539 then when i found out i wasnt going i thought i could use all these road marches toward a cause i thought it would be good to raise money for the oregon guard emergency relief fund i also wanted to bring attention to the fact that the guard is always training
7590540 a guardsmens training starts long before they get the call to go somewhere
7590541 it starts years before i wanted people to see the guard out there working sweating and pushing themselves to be better
7590542 i thought it wouldnt be too bad since i had walked it before without a ruck and i had been doing twelves for months but my legs said were done at mile thirteen
7590543 sometimes you just dont know that the guy running through your neighborhood before dawn is running to stay at his best for the next call to serve and defend

7590572 in the last 10 years there really has been almost a revolutionary change in the opinions and the views of women regarding menstruation
7590573 its not just the more mature reproductive women desiring fewer withdrawal bleeds
7590574 now thats becoming a more common desire among even younger women seeking hormonal contraception and some women have liked their experience using these longer cycle contraceptives because they can treat the side effects of mensturation yet one more example of contraception treating a medical condition images can be added to this post mary jane gallagher s picture

7590668 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7590669 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7590670 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be

7590688 el carisma de biden y su autoridad en la materia suman una tonelada de artiller a al arsenal de obama
7590689 actuar como una voz extremadamente cre ble para emitir el mensaje de que la pol tica exterior republicana ha sido en el siglo xxi un chiste triste y enfermizo

7590691 zoo professionals proclaim demanding aims for their institutions from educating the public to conservation of biodiversity many zoos define their aims as recreation education research and conservation animal rights groups claim that there is a wide gap between these claimed aims and actual practice and that zoos have commercial and entertainment purposes in mind as well as financial profit

7590702 when the taliban fell and i decided to come back to afghanistan some of my family was not happy with me
7590703 my three sons even did not come back with me but my wife and daughter did and we now live and work in kabul
7590704 when we heard from the ministry of education in kabul that they desperately needed land for a school my wife encouraged me to give this land here for a girls school
7590705 she had to move away from panjshir to get an education and she didnt want the girls today to have to do the same thing
7590706 it is a good thing that his family was willing to give their personal land for a girls school because good useable land is getting very hard to find here in panjshir
7590707 when i decided to come back to afghanistan a good friend of mine from holland asked me why i would want to leave the netherlands for afghanistan
7590708 i told him that i was sure that as long as coalition forces were here helping our government then i knew it would be a good safe place to come
7590709 i am very happy that i made the decision to come back to afghanistan because i can do something for the people here for my people
7590710 the actions of everyone that day not just torres proved we were trained and ready for this deployment

7590715 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7590716 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7590717 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7590718 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7590719 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7590720 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7590721 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7590722 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7590723 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7590724 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7590725 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7590726 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7590727 they havent called but if they need me im on a plane whatever they want

7590803 it is the responsibility of every hunter to be certain that he or she is not hunting over a baited area
7590804 the best way to determine whether or not a field is legal to hunt is to ensure that the field has been planted by legitimate agricultural practices as recommended by the university of tennessee agricultural extension service if a crop has been planted or harvested in a recommended manner it is legal to hunt however if grain has been placed on the ground in piles or strips is inconsistently distributed or placed for the purpose of attracting doves this is not a normal agricultural practice and would be considered bait

7590820 these funds will be used to ensure that our law enforcement officers and first responders have the tools necessary to prevent acts of terrorism protect citizens and infrastructure and rapidly and effectively respond to acts of terror or natural disasters
7590821 local agencies represent the first line of defense against terrorism and our ability to respond to natural or manmade disasters we will continue to provide them with the best tools possible to do their job
7590822 governor bredesen has ensured that we use homeland security funds to build significant regional capabilities throughout the state to deal with the threats of terrorism and natural disasters
7590823 we will continue to provide our homeland security districts the ability to plan train exercise and equip themselves for potential threats to tennesseans
7590824 by ignoring the tragedy in maille for so long by remaining indifferent to the pain of the survivors by letting the memory of the victims be erased france committed a moral mistake

7590829 emplean t cticas sucias apelan a la cuesti n racial y hacen falsas acusaciones para ganarse a los malayos
7590830 es la elecci n m s sucia que haya visto jam s
7590831 la elecci n en ese distrito todav a tiene que mostrar la calidad de una campa a capaz de generar confianza y optimismo para el futuro de malasia
7590832 la campa a del frente nacional se centra en la reputaci n de anwar contra la que arremeten de forma sistem tica como forma de reducir su electorado
7590833 los estudios muestran que ese tipo de ataques s lo sirve para consolidar a los partidarios tradicionales de un partido pero rara vez inciden en los votantes indecisos
7590834 cambio significa una sociedad que coloca a la constituci n por encima de la shari o s lo quiere decir menos corrupci n y mayor responsabilidad
7590835 las cuestiones clave son la libertad religiosa el predominio del derecho la independencia del poder judicial y las salvaguardas de la constituci n ante el fundamentalismo isl mico
7590836 ninguno de esos grandes asuntos se plantea ni se debate
7590837 say its unnecessary too expensive too inconvenient wont do any good or that they just arent interested
7590838 wuns goal is to foster and encourage collaboration between members and thereby bring together the knowledge experience expertise and resources necessary to address the big issues currently facing societies governments corporations and education the topic of our conference diaspora and cosmopolitanism is one of those big issues someone has said that what nationalism was to the 20th century migration would be to the 21st that is a defining feature but this was already obvious since at least the last two decades of the 20th century itself very few would disagree though with the speculation that the 21st century crystal ball promises nothing but even more widespread movements of people and ideas forced or voluntary and their permanent or semi permanent settlement in areas far flung from their natal homelands this would continue to pose tremendous challenges to the creation of political communities and management of populations more specific to us it challenges us to find new ways to think about such communities and populations and the maze of social relations that they create in an increasingly global world what we have done with our conference topic diaspora and cosmopolitanism is to suggest these two ideas and the plentitude of debates about what they mean and imply as templates for thinking about the real and burning sociological fact of the rapid dispersal of people ideas and practices in a world that in terms of the institutions of governance still likes to imagine itself as inviolably bounded in small territories called states the conference allowed us not only to deepen the research relationship we established with the university of leeds in 2006 but also gave us the opportunity to expand the collaboration to more wun member universities in addition to uw madison members participants at the conference came from the university of illinois at urbana champaign university of leeds bristol university the university of sheffield the university of toronto and york university our future plans include satellite hook up videoconference seminars faculty and student exchanges collaborative book publications and conferences

7590864 esperamos que la implementaci n de la iso 9001 contribuya a mejorar los servicios entregados por parte del municipio a la ciudadan a y transparentar los procesos porque ya estamos cansados de la poca visi n para destinar recursos en la ciudad

7590869 i dont know whether we can stop the sale but our lawyer said there were grounds for an injunction we are not a legal entity yet we are looking at registering our own trust
7590870 im surprised if they are not registered its unfortunate the project had to come to this but its been going on for years and we have wasted thousands of dollars in legal fees weve been very patient weve tried to be helpful we have not put obstacles in their way this group does not have the capacity to operate even as a tiny little community group let alone set up and operate something like the river pa we want them to go away and leave us alone
7590871 they will not be able to stop us selling the property
7590872 we bought it as freehold and it remains freehold the sale will happen as soon as the subdivision is completed and titles issued the people of patea will end up better off because half of it will be a public reserve we dont have to pay anything back to the stdc we owe nothing
7590873 we will live in their homes speak their language and absorb their culture
7590874 a teacher i was talking to said there can be groups of students in her class speaking two different languages who cant understand each other and she cant understand any of them

7590925 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
7590926 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
7590927 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

7590934 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7590935 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7590936 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions

7590956 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7590957 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7590958 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played its just that final thing we are missing either a pass not going to hand or someone having the wrong body position and losing the ball in contact or not working hard enough in support
7590959 decision making in split seconds is new to the guys and it has been a bit worrying the onus is now on the player but they want to be in a confined group where they are comfortable but im trying to say to them that even if they make a mistake i still think they are the best in the country

7590977 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7590978 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7590979 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7590980 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7590981 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7590982 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7590983 man i aint gonna vote for somebody whos been locked up
7590984 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7590985 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7590986 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7590987 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7590988 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7590989 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7590990 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7590991 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7590992 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7590993 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7590994 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7590995 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7590996 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7590997 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7590998 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7590999 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7591000 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7591001 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7591002 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7591003 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7591004 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7591005 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7591006 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7591007 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7591008 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7591009 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7591010 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7591011 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7591012 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7591013 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7591014 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7591015 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7591016 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7591017 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7591018 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7591019 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7591242 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7591243 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7591244 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7591245 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7591246 this is my first time here but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom and thank you for it
7591247 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7591248 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave
7591249 we tested infineons 3g solution in a lab in february and it was rock solid i think its more of an implementation issue
7591250 its expensive to make a baseband solution for a single customer unless you have the scale of nokia although apple may well be infineons first volume user for this chipset
7591251 there are many discerning people writing about new products such as the iphone and it does have a major impact on companies brands
7591252 my sense is that its hard for steve jobs to acknowledge a problem
7591253 that may be arrogance my guess is that hell fix this with a software update
7591254 a starting point for discussion about the best players in americas favorite game this year
7591255 i woke up in a strangers tent the next day i found out that my friends had sold me for a gram of ketamine

7591258 weve had prototypes of this tire running in canada for a while and found that the new x one xdn2 offers 7 lower rolling resistance than the xda ht tire it replaces improving fuel economy 1 to 2 compared to its traditional dual tire counterpart the xdn2 lowers rolling resistance 15 and saves an additional 170 to 180 pounds per axle
7591259 its about bringing the best of both worlds to the customer
7591260 right now two thirds of the trucking market buys tires for wear and traction while only a third buy them for fuel economy this new tire will allow truck owners to gain all three benefits in one tire
7591261 infosys believes that the acquisition will accelerate the achievement of some of infosys current strategic corporate objectives including the continued expansion of infosys consulting capabilities
7591262 police are investigating the woman most probably was not a nun
7591263 the lack of a signing of the treaty would require the iraqi government to return to the united nations to renew a request for the american forces because that would be the only solution on a legal basis for their remaining the iraqi government is sticking to not making such a request and the american side is in agreement with them on that issue and that is what makes it necessary that there be a signing of the agreement before the end of the current year
7591264 a spot that we usually hate in the states is the mc host spot that spot the compere spot is revered as a harder more experienced spot in the uk
7591265 crowd work is important here there is a great scottish pride so making fun of the british works but ultimately everyone loves to make fun of or in scottish terms take the piss out of the americans
7591266 some words references and whole jokes just dont translate here
7591267 and its hard to really go for a heckler when you cant even understand what hes saying
7591268 uk crowds are more reserved i had a show and i felt like they werent enjoying it because they werent laughing hysterically yet after the show 21 people followed us to the next bar across town to party with us and tell us how funny we were
7591269 we have had a few people come back to our show up to 5 times yet some nights they arent howling with laughter you wont find a def comedy jam audience over here
7591270 the big headliners seem to bring a special show almost a one man show type of performance to edinburgh not necessarily a compilation of their best jokes but a show with a singular point
7591271 american headliners tend to be more straight up comics youll see their highlights and less of a show with a point of view on a specific topic
7591272 youre constantly trying to get good reviews to help build your crowds thats a huge difference here than in the states reviewers are highly revered here reviews can make or break a show
7591273 the name kate copstick a top reviewer strikes fear in the hearts of most comics whereas in the states there isnt really a reviewer that will help or hinder a comics career word of mouth audiences tv appearances are what get people in but in edinburgh a 5 star review is worth more than gold
7591274 all of a sudden a year ago starting in january december i started getting worse
7591275 ive already started noticing the difference in my health as far as being able to exert myself more and not being fatigued
7591276 they said it would take six months but im starting to feel it now

7591280 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7591281 the demand for idle reduction products is growing fast driven by skyrocketing diesel prices and a tougher clean air regulatory environment
7591282 fleet owners and owner operators are increasingly looking to order new trucks with idle reduction systems installed
7591283 being closer to other dtna brands gives us the tremendous opportunity to leverage additional resources and synergies to the fuso brand
7591284 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part

7591286 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7591287 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7591288 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7591289 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7591290 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7591291 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7591292 no one works for someone we all just work together
7591293 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7591294 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7591295 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7591296 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7591297 we proberen het snel rond te krijgen maar het is nu even niet anders
7591298 maar kunnen jullie dan niet tijdelijk doorgaan met het oude systeem
7591299 het dorp noordwijk bestaat voor mij in twee gedaanten en geen van beide correspondeert nu zo precies met de werkelijkheid het dorp van mijn jeugd en het dorp dat ik als schrijver exploiteer

7591301 we spraken over het feit dat schrijvers tenminste n vorm van macht hebben de macht om met hun verbeelding een wereld te maken die niet bestaat en toch geldig is

7591303 nostalgie leidt tot verwarrende verlangens naar wat voorgoed voorbij is en de vertekende herinnering eraan naar wat misschien nooit bestaan heeft maar toch herkenbaar en haalbaar lijkt vandaar ook dat de troost het van de treurnis wint
7591304 dat de wetten die wel serieus genomen worden in feite net zo lachwekkend zijn als men de wetgevers heeft gelaakt
7591305 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone

7591317 in our quest to continue our follow the child initiative we need to see where we can maximize our resources and eliminate and modify what we can as good as we are we can get better and we will
7591318 i know the climate of every sau in the state
7591319 i base a lot on thinking that if i had a child starting school and i knew they would have to stay in the same school system their entire school career would i stay or would i move here we have blended our system well with portsmouth we always visited both school systems and had lunch with the kids we need to listen to the voices of children and you educators are some of the best in the state
7591320 weve seen lots of change technology being the obvious one but the world is more fast paced now than ever and its easy to lose our understanding that all children can learn they learn in different ways and we need to have an understanding of how each one learns the end game for all students is that they go on to be lifelong learners you must be the motivators coaches and cheerleaders for each child
7591321 what if there was a grading system that was a b and not yet what can we do to bring not yet to there we can use intensive tutoring a collaborative effort teachers in successful schools are master motivators

7591326 nac en la bulgaria comunista mi familia pertenec a al politbur y yo era miembro de los pioneros una organizaci n de la infancia comunista en mi familia todos est bamos orgullosos del r gimen
7591327 viv a en sof a capital de bulgaria y de peque a con mis amigas nos divertiamos mirando a las personas que se animaban a entrar en la iglesia l gicamente eran personas mayores que no ten an nada que perder para el r gimen comunista la religi n era el opio de los pueblos y si te ve an practic ndola te expulsaban de los colegios y del partido no hab a libertad
7591328 debo admitir que un par de veces entr a escondidas a la catedral de san jorge me resultaba fascinante el cuidado que hab a en el culto ortodoxo el tema de las velas el orden con que se las prend an y apagaban los conos que adornaban las paredes del templo y otras manifestaciones del rito que despertaban mi atenci n adolescente salvo estas escasas excepciones mi contacto con la religi n era nulo
7591329 a los 16 a os emigr con mi madre que es fil loga y periodista a buenos aires tuvimos que salir separadas porque de lo contrario sospechar an que aquello era m s que un viaje de turismo no nos hizo falta escaparnos porque mi familia ten a una posici n privilegiada dentro del partido comunista mi abuelo paterno era miembro del politbur y fue gobernador de una provincia b lgara durante 15 a os y mi abuelo materno era diplom tico con lo cual no nos fue dif cil obtener los permisos legales para salir del pa s
7591330 es cristo que pasa y otros libros de san josemar a que me ayudaron a conocer m s aspectos de la vida de fe y a concretarlos en mi vida

7591340 acto de protesta frente a la corte superior de distrito en cochabamba
7591341 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7591342 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7591343 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7591344 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7591345 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7591346 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7591347 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7591348 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7591349 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7591350 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7591351 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7591352 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7591353 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7591354 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7591355 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7591356 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7591357 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7591358 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7591359 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7591360 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7591361 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7591362 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7591363 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7591364 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7591365 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7591366 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7591367 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7591368 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7591369 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7591370 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7591371 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7591372 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7591373 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7591374 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7591375 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7591376 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7591377 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7591378 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7591379 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7591380 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7591381 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7591382 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7591383 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7591384 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7591385 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7591386 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7591387 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7591388 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7591389 their anger and negativity will one day be their undoing
7591390 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7591391 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7591392 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7591393 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7591394 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7591395 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7591396 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7591397 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7591398 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7591399 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7591400 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7591401 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7591402 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7591403 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7591404 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7591405 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7591406 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7591407 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7591408 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7591409 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7591410 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7591411 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7591412 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7591413 at that time i will be releasing them i will tell them that i intend to vote for senator obama a lot of people are committed to unifying behind senator obama how they vote is a more personal decision because a lot of them feel like they represent people who sent them there to vote for me a lot of them feel that you know they want to have their chance to vote for me and then well all vote together that is what traditionally happens we could go back and have a long history lesson about how this has worked before i dont think you would find a more cooperative relationship between two campaigns at least as far as i can remember in any kind of contested primary season once we get to the convention so of course some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling both ways their constituents voted for me but of course they are going to do everything they can for senator obama so thats why i am saying what i am going to do releasing them and letting them know that however they do decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama once the nomination is finally declared and we leave denver and thats the real goal here it is to make sure that people feel good about their experience in denver that they feel like they had a chance to be heard that they did get an opportunity to say what they had to say and what they came to say but then we leave here and we are all behind senator obama and it is so much of a smoother convention its not like anything like a lot of the challenges and the fights and the disagreements you know in my experience going back gosh a long time so i would just suggest to you that i know we have 24 7 news cycle to fill but clearly what maggie williams and david axelrod said yesterday about how were working together and how we intend to unify our party and elect senator obama is exactly whats going on
7591414 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention as well as it should be
7591415 come on this is new york are you ready to elect a president
7591416 we stayed with hillary right up there to the end
7591417 we are united in one thing we are going to elect barack obama president of the united states
7591418 and the person who will be leading the charge to do that
7591419 hillary clinton will lead all of us in new york and in this country to make sure that barack obama
7591420 struggle that broke so many glass ceilings but didnt quite break one more
7591421 despite the sexism and despite everything else nothing stops her
7591422 all of you here in new york played such an instrumental role in my campaign
7591423 and now i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack obama and joe biden as you worked for me
7591424 the mccain campaign is running ads that are trying to divide us
7591425 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7591426 everyone of us could stand up and recite all the reasons we must elect barack
7591427 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house
7591428 zache s kom vlug naar beneden want vandaag moet ik in jouw huis verblijven
7591429 hij is het huis van een zondig mens binnengegaan om onderdak te vinden voor de nacht
7591430 kijk heer de helft van mijn bezittingen geef ik aan de armen en als ik iemand heb afgeperst vergoed ik het viervoudig
7591431 vandaag is dit huis redding ten deel gevallen want ook hij is een zoon van abraham de mensenzoon is gekomen om te zoeken en te redden wat verloren was
7591432 of the newly renovated buildings on the south side of greenpoint ave b t manhattan and franklin
7591433 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
7591434 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7591435 this is a planning took where all things are going
7591436 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7591437 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7591438 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7591439 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7591440 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7591441 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7591442 jimmy bullard was in an offside position when he crossed for the huge norweigan to score
7591443 there is no need for the ball to be played forward
7591444 we are looking at some technical aspects of the case with the assistance of a british sports medicine and doping expert and we will then file appeal we have sent a formal request to the ipl for a hearing in which we have informed them that the tests had shown traces of different food in the sample as well
7591445 we are hoping to play a tri series in south africa with india the indian board president during the teleconference gave us 50 per cent assurance that this might be possible
7591446 we have also spoken to australia that if the south african plan does not materialise we can involve them but we first have to see how the indian board responds because their participation will help boost broadcasters and sponsors interest in such a series
7591447 the postponement of the champions trophy means that all the teams are free next month and i think they can help us out obviously the postponement has been a setback for us in many ways and we need to play cricket
7591448 we wouldnt like to blame anyone we are disappointed that despite our security assurances they didnt listen to us but the problem is that while we had made elaborate security plan for the tournament every team had their own areas of concerns and it was not possible to cater to all of them
7591449 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys

7591467 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7591468 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7591469 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7591470 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7591471 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7591472 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7591473 we know that parents have a tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat

7591484 im sure that not everything about the internet is bad
7591485 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps
7591486 al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
7591487 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps
7591488 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students
7591489 al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
7591490 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them many have spent time with osama bin laden
7591491 there are indications of a fairly close shabab al qaeda connection though its not clear to what extent theyve been operationalized
7591492 is shabab taking orders from al qaeda i would say no they are still running their own show
7591493 once we end the holy war in somalia we will take it to any government that participated in the fighting against somalia or gave assistance to those attacking us
7591494 and they cant afford to do that because the clans provide their foot soldiers
7591495 they are still a threat but clearly their network and operations have been degraded
7591496 eigentlich hatte ich kfz mechaniker in der autowerkstatt meiner eltern gelernt
7591497 mein mann kurt und ich hatten fr her eine kfz meisterwerkstatt aber unsere s hne wollten den betrieb nicht bernehmen dann hatte mein mann die idee mit dem swinger club wir hatten selbst fter mal solche clubs besucht und wollten etwas mit mehr exklusivit t aufmachen
7591498 ich habe meinen ausbilder gemacht wir haben eine vollkonzession und einen k chenmeister eingestellt da gab uns die ihk in koblenz die genehmigung auszubilden

7591512 jodi benson who voiced ariel in the little mermaid and also did the voice for tour guide barbie in toy story 2 confirmed that mr michael keaton himself will be joining the cast as a ken doll to her barbie
7591513 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7591520 vi la segunda parte y me encontr el equipo con nueve jugadores y la remontada fue espectacular porque hacerla con nueve sigue demostrando esp ritu

7591525 we serve cheese to guests as part of our welcome to the inn
7591526 and we buy small cheeses from small producers so that it is always in peak condition we dont print them on our menu because we prefer to tell the guests about them at the table we may have a triple cr me latour a roaring forties from australia or any number of new england cheddars
7591527 an old french saying goes a meal without cheese is like a beautiful girl with one eye only i feel it is part of a classic french meal and is very popular with our guests
7591528 when i was young and wandering around europe i always thought the cheese course was the best part of any meal
7591529 but when i started to manage restaurants in the u s all id find was some awful port salut and salty roquefort so when i took the job at the ritz carlton in san francisco i insisted on a years trial period for a serious cheese cart and by years end at least half of the guests opted for it now at cyrus 70 percent take cheese we have about 30 cheeses with 15 to 20 offered on any given night and theres nothing i love more than to describe the varieties to my guests

7591531 se hizo una segunda parte muy mala y todo lo bien que se hab a hecho en la ida se fue en la segunda parte de ayer y la verdad es que te quedas jodido
7591532 no puede volver a pasar por la forma en la que se perdi
7591533 no se supo jugar ni contra diez ni contra nueve y se cay merecidamente
7591534 si no se trabaja no se corre y se hace bien pueden pasar esas cosas como sta aunque sea contra nueve
7591535 no se puede empezar a poner malas caras y agachar la cabeza pero lo de ayer tiene que servir para todos para saber que hay que seguir una l nea de trabajo y de humildad
7591536 es un gran compa ero y un gran portero y aqu cuando perdemos perdemos todos y no se puede culpar a alguien en concreto
7591537 se perdi por culpa de todos porque se fall en todos los aspectos en la segunda parte
7591538 conf o en que villa siga en el equipo aunque es una decisi n que debe tomar el club de todas formas prefiero que se quede porque es un gran jugador y compa ero
7591539 el mejor fichaje es toda la plantilla porque para hacer algo grande tenemos que estar todos a un buen nivel con buen compa erismo y actitud
7591540 un grupo en el que todos tienen que correr y trabajar
7591541 si se quedan villa y silva mucho mejor pero los partidos los ganamos y los perdemos todos

7591562 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
7591563 he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7591564 that should be painless he isnt running against the clinton legacy anymore and it would probably be a good idea to remind voters that the last time democrats were in charge of the white house we had peace and prosperity
7591565 similarly he could thank president clinton for all of the work he did throughout his life to bridge the divides in our country this is a cause near and dear to the presidents heart

7591677 its something ive been preparing for my entire life basically its what ive been doing for 10 years

7591756 computerspiele mit gewaltinhalten f hren fter zu erh hten aggressivit tsleveln als beispielsweise das ansehen von horror oder gewaltfilmen
7591757 es handelt sich bei den ursachen f r aggressivit t vielmehr um ein quintett an faktoren in dem der medienkonsum aber eine schl sselrolle einnimmt
7591758 wer in einem elternhaus aufw chst in dem gewalt an der tagesordnung ist ist f r gewalt in medien anf lliger
7591759 umgekehrt werden die einfl sse von medialer gewalt in sehr harmonischen und liebevollen familien stark abgefedert
7591760 das ergebnis war eindeutig wer viele gewaltt tige computerspiele spielte wurde auch im realen leben aggressiver
7591761 die jugendlichen spielen sich in einen rausch und sind in ihrer welt helden
7591762 das ist im gegensatz zu gewalt und horrorfilmen genau das problem an derartigen spielen denn die jugendlichen schalten oftmals nicht nach 90 minuten ab und gehen danach ihrem sonstigen leben nach sondern die spiele sind teilweise ihr leben

7591769 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7591770 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7591771 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7591772 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7591773 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years

7591785 clients relying on publicly funded clinics received a broader scope of sexual and reproductive health care services than those relying on private doctors

7591788 all i could do is say church would you consider this
7591789 said harris now a deacon at st aloysius church in pewee valley where he will become associate pastor upon his ordination
7591790 if the church had said no i would have gone on and enjoyed my faith and done something else
7591791 he understands what its like to be married to have children to have that life besides being a very spiritual person

7591796 my brother has always had a fantastic heart for people
7591797 he was really big on spreading the word and telling us as catholics we need to make sure were spreading the word
7591798 thats something youll have to take up with the church
7591799 its just like my situation ultimately the church makes that discernment

7591838 as democrats are coming together this week in denver to bring the change americas working families need and deserve john mccain is bragging about his support for president bushs failed and flawed policies and his promise of more of the same
7591839 the last thing the american people can afford is another republican who voted with president bush more than 90 percent of the time and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong only someone who cant keep track of how many houses he owns would look back at the last eight years and say we need four more
7591840 are you proud of the work and the work and the leadership of the commander in chief in this war
7591841 yes i am i think the president has led with great clarity and i think hes done a great job leading the country dont you all
7591842 the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed i voted with the president over 90 percent of the time higher than a lot of my even republican colleagues
7591843 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day i have been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7591844 i didnt take the dog whose ashes im finally picking up to be put to be euthanized on the day that she ended up dying in her sleep because i was too busy having a giant party trying to keep you from being our fucking governor any more mofo

7591846 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7591847 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7591848 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7591849 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7591850 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
7591851 as always well continue to research all of our options
7591852 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7591853 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7591854 he has not been bouncing back and forth like brett favre

7591874 its been a while since i took geometry its been even longer since you took geometry
7591875 you know what else is strange looking at a total stranger who looks totally familiar then comparing life stories only to realize that you are the only common link it was six degrees of john letoto and it was hilariously awkward i think its fair to say we both blame your camera
7591876 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver

7591882 johns a little coffee press strong and brown here is his handle here is his frown
7591883 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler
7591884 were talking about logic and about the law of non contradiction in worldviews and im pretty sure theres a law that says if theres food being given away and letoto is present then letoto is eating

7592068 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7592069 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7592070 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7592071 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7592072 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7592073 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7592074 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7592075 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7592076 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7592077 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalized form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7592078 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7592079 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours
7592080 we are keeping up on your path fadel as you lay in rest
7592081 the blood of fadel shanaa will be the fuel for other cameramen and journalists to continue to convey the message to continue to report the truth to the outside world we wont be hindered or hampered by israeli actions we ask and seek the support of the united nations human rights groups and world news outlets so the killers of shanaa can be brought to justice
7592082 the killers of shanaa must be punished the blood of shanaa and that of the eight children must not be wasted
7592083 the israeli soldiers intentionally killed this journalist as he was not in a place of danger he was wearing a vest marked with the word press on it he was filming about 750 meters away from the israeli tank but the israeli tank shelled and killed him intentionally in an attempt to blackout an israeli invasion of the middle area of the gaza strip at that particular day
7592084 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

7592145 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind

7592147 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector were big believers in egs and were looking for more opportunities

7592204 i am surprised and disappointed that i am not being rewarded for having scored consistently in the first class season
7592205 i was really looking forward to playing against a testing opposition that australia a would surely be
7592206 i am in london but on holiday with my family till monday and also cant divulge information if an appointment has been sought for sachin
7592207 do you not know brothers for i am speaking to men who know the law that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives for example by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage so then if she marries another man while her husband is still alive she is called an adulteress but if her husband dies she is released from that law and is not an adulteress even though she marries another man
7592208 i john take thee jane to be my wedded wife to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death us do part according to gods holy ordinance and thereto i pledge thee my troth
7592209 do you not know brothers for i am speaking to men who know the law that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives for example by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage
7592210 havent you read that at the beginning the creator made them male and female and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
7592211 but for adam no suitable helper was found so the lord god caused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping he took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh then the lord god made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man and he brought her to the man the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and they will become one flesh the man and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame
7592212 so then if she marries another man while her husband is alive she is called an adulteress but if her husband dies she is released from that law and is not an adulteress even though she marries another man
7592213 what god hath brought together let not man put asunder
7592214 god didnt bring us together it was all our doing god wasnt in this marriage from the very beginning we are just understanding that now we brought the marriage together not god the bible says what god has brought together let no man separate
7592215 i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery
7592216 if a man commits adultery with another mans wife with the wife of his neighbor both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death
7592217 if a man is found sleeping with another mans wife both the man who slept with her and the woman must die you must purge the evil from israel
7592218 the law of moses requires this woman to be put to death what do you say jesus
7592219 im not going to enforce the strict death penalty for adultery so then ill allow divorce for adultery and remarriage after the divorce since if i had required the strict death penalty for adultery the innocent spouse would be able to remarry after the death of the executed spouse
7592220 jesus answered him it is written do not put the lord your god to the test
7592221 its a very terrifying thing to fall into the hands of an angry god
7592222 therefore marriage is not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently deliberately and in accordance with the purposes for which it was instituted by god
7592223 what god hath joined together let not man put asunder
7592224 i am surprised and disappointed that i am not being rewarded for having scored consistently in the first class season

7592239 russia should have recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia long ago and should have followed it up with defense cooperation and assistance treaties long ago too
7592240 currently it is important for us that south ossetia should gain independence legally from the point of view of the world community
7592241 after this we shall be able to seek accession into the russian federation but this issue will be postponed for the future
7592242 only the international recognition of independence and sovereignty will give reliable international guarantees of security and free development rights improve the situation and ensure stability in the caucasian region
7592243 the situation in the caucasus will get much worse against the background of a most serious crisis in relations between russia and the united states and western europe

7592561 ik zou het leven zonder lekker eten maar een saaie boel vinden afschaffen van alle luxe en bezit is geen optie maar tien keer per jaar op vakantie in een straaljager zonder je om het milieu te bekommeren dat kan ook niet de bedoeling zijn dan maar vier keer per jaar of twee balanceren is moeilijk je doet het altijd verkeerd je bent altijd bekritiseerbaar maar het leren omgaan met luxe is een van de grote taken die wij nu hebben we zouden in de leer kunnen gaan bij seneca een klassieke denker die zelf puissant rijk was tegelijk dacht hij na over de vraag hoe je op individueel niveau overdaad en hebzucht kunt bestrijden

7592563 bezwaren tegen luxe vind je vooral in de vroegste tijd
7592564 men geeft af op de cultuur waarvan men afstand wil nemen het fulmineren ebt evenwel geleidelijk weg en maakt plaats voor een voorzichtige omarming augustinus kan het zich niet veroorloven net zoals tertullianus te spreken zodra het christendom erkend wordt verrijzen er mooie kerken de christelijke keizers kunnen met een totaal afwijzende houding niet uit de voeten de kerk is een belangrijk instituut en dat wil je laten zien met pralende schijn en schoonheid ter ere van god rijkdom is een manier om te laten zien dat je aanwezig bent hoe kun je anders verdedigen dat een bisschop in purper loopt terwijl er zo veel armen zijn

7592581 when i put it to fifa i was almost put down they said that this is football it wouldnt work im of a different opinion i think it would work and take a lot of pressure off referees
7592582 you could have a policy like tennis where managers are allowed two challenges per game to the video referee

7592596 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over

7592615 sun paid 1 billion to acquire the open source database and the var guy initially praised the deal
7592616 one of the sad things we see at them moment is the decreasing amount of interest in investing in openoffice org so we see sun cutting sun we screwed up on open source

7592644 i was at the game and shaun was excellent so he certainly comes back into my thoughts it looks as if he has had a new lease of life
7592645 i am going to announce the squad on wednesday and he comes into consideration i didnt forgot about shaun the problem was he wasnt playing at aston villa
7592646 at the moment we havent decided the exact dates and i am waiting for a call from daniele prad
7592647 roma have more than one target and castillo could be one of those daniele was talking with luciano spalletti regarding the technical qualities of the player and then we will discuss the financial side of the deal
7592648 the spaniards are waiting but nery said he wants to play in italy
7592649 he wants the giallorossi because they are a prestigious side and because he thinks he would fit in well in spallettis formation
7592650 now he is waiting for roma there is not much time left one week before the end of the transfer window but in the next 24 48 hours we should have everything clear
7592651 it is a big priority we have played two league games and we have taken three points
7592652 we have got a massive game at home against west brom on the saturday after and then fulham the saturday after that away from home
7592653 but the priority now becomes beating northampton at home we want to do as well as we possibly can in that cup
7592654 i want to pick the strongest team i can to get through in that competition
7592655 what was happening to us last year was purely as a reaction to what our league form was doing but we are not in that position just at the moment and hopefully wont be
7592656 there may be one or two forced on us because of a couple of knocks that we got on saturday
7592657 but i would like to be in a position where we can give it everything we have possibly got to win the competitions that we are entering
7592658 last year we had issues purely and simply because of our league position and that had to be where we prioritised
7592659 but we will be putting out a strong team against northampton because we want to go through
7592660 we would like to bring somebody in we would like to bring a minimum of two people into the football club if we can
7592661 we are not a champions league team we have got some champions league qualities about us in terms of effort and desire and all that
7592662 but what we have got to try to do is bring in two players who we can put into that first team to make us better and not just two bodies

7592717 i dont expect that players will always play well but im not having that every single one of my players gave it everything when you go and turn in the performances we have done this weekend it is very hard to accept this will definitely be a blip because its up to me to do something about it
7592718 people on saturday were moaning about the formation but its not that because we went 4 4 2 and we were still all over the place i changed it because they were getting right on top of us and we didnt seem to be able to handle it we tried to get a few bodies behind it but it just wasnt working

7592785 its been discouraging how slow energy companies have been bringing hydrogen online
7592786 you do take account of the time it takes women to get in and out as opposed to men
7592787 legislation that says 2 to 1 is a very simplistic mindless way to do it
7592788 cooperation with nato is a complex issue and until russias political leaders have made a decision on what is involved the defence ministry suspended military cooperation with the alliance
7592789 yours was an unnatural birth you came from a human being
7592790 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7592791 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7592792 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7592793 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7592794 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7592795 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7592796 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together

7592800 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7592801 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7592802 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7592803 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7592804 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7592805 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7592806 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7592807 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7592808 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7592809 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump
7592810 he worked with the athletic department and the university administration to make sure that revenue from ticket sales would be committed over a period of time to add up to the 4 5 million
7592811 the way it looks right now its more of just a wet spell a bit of an annoyance
7592812 all of these things we have to take on a case by case basis
7592813 but its nothing that we havent experienced in the past

7592828 we will take any decision up to terminating relations entirely
7592829 cooperation is above all in the interests of nato not russia
7592830 we want our relations to be full fledged and those of partners but we do not want an illusion of partnership

7592844 you have to choose between maybe some of your favorite teams then homecoming along with the pajama game
7592845 a couple years ago we had it on sale for a few days and it took us a few days to get to that number
7592846 last year we had the same exact number and it took us about an hour
7592847 it will give us a shot to see what it is all about rather than wait for a lottery
7592848 it should be first come first served because even if you apply before somebody else they might end up with tickets
7592849 i surely wouldnt have had to wait anxiously by my computer for over an hour and try to get tickets
7592850 i wouldnt want to be anywhere on saturday night other than death valley
7592851 he wasnt in an offense that was highlighting the quarterback
7592852 he won in a manner that let me believe at that time that there was upside and potential for him to grow
7592853 he scrambled well he executed the offense well he took hits well
7592854 he directed traffic he did all those intangibles that quarterbacks do i watched that he didnt throw for a lot of yards he had decent completion percentage but he won
7592855 he always enjoyed being out there whether it was just being a ball boy on the sidelines or at practice running around and throwing the ball with the players or other coaches kids
7592856 this competitions going to do nothing but benefit all of us
7592857 were working hard and were doing our thing were out there grinding were working hard absorbing all the information we can
7592858 you like to give him all the snaps you can give him
7592859 what we have to do is make him comfortable in some of the situations that we know were going to be in with him if we do that well be fine
7592860 through the trials that happen in football hes got a father whos very grounded and helps him along the way and tells him thats just part of life
7592861 he is unflappable he has a sense not to let the rush that comes around him or the people trying to get to him bother him
7592862 he just stays focused on the receiver and what his objective is hes as good as ive ever seen at that
7592863 jarrett has a very quick release and throws above the rush and the pass
7592864 hes worked hard in his footwork and hes worked hard in recognizing things he throws a soft ball enabling the receivers to get yardage after the catch and he doesnt get rattled thats pretty impressive
7592865 i remember how he was going into that not bothered at all in fact he was the same guy he was when we were ahead earlier in the game he looked at me and said ok coach we got to catch up lets do it and we did
7592866 hes playing for a group of guys over there that are phenomenal
7592867 there are good men over there that hes being coached by who are teaching him life lessons too were really happy with where he is and what hes doing and his opportunity this early to play for the defending national champions
7592868 there was a lot of fanfare when he moved to brenham because he was well documented as a potentially great quarterback but he didnt know a soul
7592869 his personality was such that he was able to come in here and quickly make friends with everybody he doesnt really want a lot of attention on himself hes a guys guy
7592870 jarretts a great guy weve gotten along always gone golfing together a few times
7592871 hes a very talented quarterback he throws a really good ball we can learn from some of the things that we each do help each other out on a few things and really compete to be the best we can be to help the team in any way we can
7592872 hatch and i hang out a lot we play a lot of golf with each other
7592873 we have the same kind of personality we laugh at the same things and listen to the same music nothings different about either one of us its fun to hang around and be with him
7592874 we talk about how doing things everyday is whats going to make you better learning to practice learning to do those things and everything else will take care of itself
7592875 we talk about spiritual things as well hopefully ive taught him just to be a good person to be a good man
7592876 i did not know that and did i want to
7592877 when i was daydreaming about playing football i dont think i ever had on an lsu uniform in my thoughts
7592878 but thats just the way life is and how the journey turns out sometimes i have no regrets and i am happy the way it all turned out
7592879 he wasnt in an offense that was highlighting the quarterback
7592880 but at the same time he took over the game i watched he didnt throw for a lot of yards he had a decent completion percentage but he won and he won in a manner that let me believe at that time that there was upside and potential for him to grow
7592881 it was the best fit at the time for me and my family
7592882 harvard is a great school where i also got the opportunity to play football and for me that seemed like the place i needed to be
7592883 at the time as a freshman he was our no 4 quarterback behind some good players but we obviously thought he had the potential to be a very quality quarterback
7592884 we told him he would have to walk on and earn the scholarship and he did
7592885 and he came and was now 6 foot 4 and instead of 190 he was 220 pounds so immediately there was a kid that i liked with a bigger frame
7592886 andrew and i talked at length and since this was something he really wanted to do i didnt want to hold him back
7592887 ive always believed that you have to set your goals high
7592888 the odds were not in my favor and there were several talented players in front of me but i always believed if i worked hard enough and did the right things that i would be in a position to get on the field
7592889 he has a good arm and good mobility and will be a solid player when given his opportunity
7592890 i do not know his specific situation but i do know he worked very hard to get here
7592891 as a teammate i like that in a quarterback because i know he will do what it takes to win because of how hard he had to travel to get here
7592892 we felt andrew hatch had the potential to be a quality division i quarterback
7592893 but with limited experience lsu fans will have to cut him some slack because any quarterback in that situation will make his share of mistakes
7592894 its been a great year so many great things have happened to our kids because of them because of what they put into it
7592895 im sorry to see terry and cliff go but very thankful for the effort put in
7592896 they will always have made their mark on the program here at lsu but i am equally as excited about the future of the program
7592897 during those three years that he coached with me david and i forged a very close bond beyond a friendship really
7592898 his vision of the game and his knowledge of what it takes to win recruit players develop players and work in a cohesive way with the other staff members was something that to me was off the charts
7592899 ive been around for a lot of national championships but this one is special because its my first as a head coach
7592900 its great to see all of the athletes hard work pay off thats the most satisfying thing especially for our seniors who went out as national champions for the first time
7592901 a rope tied in a slip knot which binds closer the more it is drawn which historically has been used in execution by hanging and which symbolizes racism and intimidation
7592902 the flag is seen by some southerners simply as a symbol of southern pride but the flag is often used by racists to represent white domination of african americans
7592903 those ideas of the u s constitution were fundamentally wrong our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea its foundations laid its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition this our new government is the first in the history of the world based upon this great physical philosophical and moral truth
7592904 it is indeed in conformity with the ordinance of the creator
7592905 it is not for us to inquire into the wisdom of his ordinances or to question them for his own purposes he has made one race to differ from another
7592906 passage of the bill really shows the heart and mindset of the state has changed
7592907 i hope no one will be prosecuted under this law we should not fight but do whats right
7592908 we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children
7592909 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him

7592926 ben diverso dalle simulazioni dei tanti spettacoli che si ritrovano dalle sagre di paese agli stessi parchi divertimenti tipo gardaland
7592927 prima spiega messer torre erano giusto delle sagre coi paesani in calzamaglia pomosse dalle proloco negli ultimi 10 anni invece si st puntando anche allaspetto culturale tanto che alcune di queste feste sono dei veri e propri campi di archeologia ricostruttiva

7592932 anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it
7592933 it definitively caused the problem yet reported no detectable errors weve taken steps to fortify our shipping system with the acquisition of additional equipment and worked with our vendors to verify were in good shape elsewhere
7592934 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
7592935 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
7592936 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
7592937 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but were charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
7592938 depending on the benchmarks you choose you might see massive speed up minor speed up or maybe even some slowdown those latter cases are definitely bugs and reporting them through bugzilla will be a big help
7592939 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
7592940 as the performance keeps going up people will write and transport code that was too slow to run in the browser as javascript this means the web can accommodate workloads that right now require a proprietary plugin
7592941 we feel its a natural feature just like when you buy a cd you should be able to do what you want with your tracks

7592957 telah terbelah bulan pada zaman rasululluah menjadi 2 bagian sebagian di atas gunung dan sebagian lainnya di bawahnya maka rasulullah saw bersabda saksikanlah
7592958 ini merupakan periwayatan periwayatan dari para sahabat dan sedemikiab masyhurnya peristiwa ini dengan sanad banyak apalagi disertai dengan firman allah swt dalam
7592959 diantara tanda paling agung yang menunjukkan kebenaran yang datang dari rasulullah saw bahwasanya ketika orang orang yang mendustakannya meminta untuk diperlihatkan kepada mereka kejadian luar biasa untuk membuktikan kebenaran yang dibawanya lalu beliau mengisyaratkan ke bulan dengan izin allah swt maka terbelahlah bulan menjadi dua bagian satu bagian di gunung abu qubais dan bagian yang lain di gunung qaiquan orang orang musyrik mmenyaksikan peristiwa alam luar biasa dan agung di langit peristiwa itu tidak mampu dilakukan dicontoh serta direkayasa oleh manusia mereka menyaksikan perkara yang tidak pernah dilihat senelumnya bahkan tidak mendengar seorang nabipun sebelumnya yang melakukan peristiwa semisalnya
7592960 terbelahnya bulan merupakan bukti agung yang tidak dapat ditandingi oleh para nabi lainnya dan sesungguhnya yang demikian itu nampak di kerajaan langit di luar kebiasaan yang terjadi di alam semesta ini maka tidak akan mungkin seseorang pun yang mampu untuk berbuat seperti ini dengan tipuan hal ini menjadi petunjuk dan bukti yan lebih jelas lagi nyata
7592961 por qu si estaban corriendo hac a la derecha ahora cogen para el otro lado
7592962 cuando particip en mis primeros juegos en barcelona en 1992 me acost m s en esas dos semanas y media que en el resto de mi vida hasta ese punto
7592963 lo que es decir dos veces que puede que no suene mucho pero para un estudiante universitario de 21 a os con dientes torcidos fue un peque o milagro
7592964 barcelona fue para muchos de nosotros v rgenes ol mpicos tanto acerca del sexo como del deporte
7592965 no eran solo los hombres las mujeres tambi n parec an esclavas de su hormonas lanzando miradas provocadoras y sonrisas explosivas como confeti
7592966 era un esfuerzo de la voluntad mantener todo en orden hasta que la competencia hubiera terminado pero apenas ramos eliminados de nuestras respectivas competencias nos lanz bamos unos sobre otros como esgrimistas suicidas
7592967 habl con una competidora de tenis de mesa de australia esta semana para ver como estaba la vibra en la villa y se despach en un ahogado tartamudeo propio de todo debutante ol mpico es incre ble all dentro todo el mundo se enloquece una vez sale de la competencia
7592968 los hombres que gana medallas de oro son el objeto principal del deseo de las atletas femeninas hay algo que tiene el xito deportivo que hace que un cierto tipo de mujer se enloquezca
7592969 il nostro modo di fare opposizione osserva giuseppe fioroni ci chiede qualcosa in pi non vogliamo fare gli
7592970 aspetto il giorno ha detto in cui la gente dir io sono democratica io sono democratico vivendo il partito come appartenenza come condivisione di ideali non credo nel modello del partito leggero o liquido ma nellidentit e nella condivisione questo significa che le feste i circoli e tutti i momenti di partecipazione devono avere un valore eccezionale per il nostro partito
7592971 non faremo il congresso fin quando non avremo un circolo in ogni comune il contributo dei territori fondamentale nei circoli si fa politica ma anche presenza pre politica si intercettano i bisogni e le necessit della gente
7592972 adesso non abbiamo bisogno del congresso io guardo piuttosto alla conferenza programmatica del 7 e dell 8 novembre a firenze in cui il pd toscano dovr dire quale sono le sue idee per lo sviluppo della regione si avvicinano le lezioni in duecentoquindici comuni toscani su duecentottanta ricorda manciulli e noi non dobbiamo presentare duecentoquindici candidati con idee diverse ma ununica squadra con una chiara visione del profilo di crescita che vogliamo dare alla toscana
7592973 c tanto lavoro da fare e noi dobbiamo incalzare il governo su tutte le scelte da prendere nel documento di programmazione economica e finanziaria per la toscana non c niente di quanto concordato a partite dalle infrastrutture non abbiamo certezze sul completamento della due mari e dellautostrada tirrenica
7592974 oggi ha chiosato manciulli non possiamo perder tempo dobbiamo lavorare solo sulle cose concrete perch anche la toscana sia un laboratorio capace di esprima la ricetta del pd per risolvere i problemi del paese
7592975 sono per le primarie ha detto fioroni ma stiamo attenti a non farle diventare pi che uno strumento di costruzione una sottrazione di quella fetta di partito che appoggia i candidati che usciranno perdenti dai confronti non isoliamo chi perde non abdichiamo ma al dialogo interno e a chi la pensa diversamente il pensiero unico lasciamolo ai nostri antagonisti
7592976 nel nostro territorio in cui il legame con il partito ancora solido e reale le primarie hanno davvero unimportanza enorme perch ci permettono di eleggere la migliore espressione del territorio secondo i cittadini regaliamo un dibattito franco ed evitiamo le filiazioni con questo o quel leader a livello nazionale
7592977 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7592978 offers the potential for stroke patients to recover return to nearly normal functional status and stay out of nursing homes
7592979 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7592980 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7592981 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7592982 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7592983 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7592984 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7592985 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7592986 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs
7592987 despite great expectations and promising results of clinical trials we still lack sufficient evidence of an effective vaccine against cervical cancer with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious
7592988 at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7592989 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7592990 rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
7592991 successive decisions have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools
7592992 these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7592993 and when he had called his twelve disciples to him he gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease
7592994 he who receives you receives me and he who receives me receives him who sent me
7592995 and i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7592996 so jesus said to them assuredly i say to you that in the regeneration when the son of man sits on the throne of his glory you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
7592997 but you are those who have continued with me in my trials and i bestow upon you a kingdom just as my father bestowed one upon me
7592998 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone
7592999 now the wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
7593000 i am the true vine and my father is the vinedresser
7593001 you have brought a vine out of egypt you have cast out the nations and planted it
7593002 for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah are his pleasant plant he looked for justice but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry for help
7593003 every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away and every branch that bears fruit he prunes that it may bear more fruit
7593004 you are already clean because of the word which i have spoken to you
7593005 how can a young man cleanse his way by taking heed according to your word
7593006 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me
7593007 i am the vine you are the branches he who abides in me and i in him bears much fruit for without me you can do nothing
7593008 if anyone does not abide in me he is cast out as a branch and is withered and they gather them and throw them into the fire and they are burned
7593009 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you will ask what you desire and it shall be done for you
7593010 by this my father is glorified that you bear much fruit so you will be my disciples
7593011 as the father loved me i also have loved you abide in my love
7593012 if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
7593013 these things i have spoken to you that my joy may remain in you and that your joy may be full
7593014 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you
7593015 greater love has no one than this than to lay down ones life for his friends
7593016 you are my friends if you do whatever i command you
7593017 no longer do i call you servants for a servant does not know what his master is doing but i have called you friends for all things that i heard from my father i have made known to you
7593018 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7593019 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7593020 it has a soul it has a story to tell
7593021 were like a foster home we take an item in clean it and take care of it until someone else comes in buys it and loves it
7593022 at the mall its all the same styles in six different color schemes here no two pieces are alike
7593023 you dont have to fit this box that the store says is a size 4
7593024 a seamstress made your dress not a small child in cambodia
7593025 its obviously better to keep re using things than to throw them away
7593026 right now thrift stores are really having a resurgence of popularity
7593027 its a kind of an inexpensive way to decorate your room
7593028 you spend so much money during college that theres no reason to spend more than you have to on things you could get for a lot cheaper
7593029 i enjoy digging through the trash to find the treasure
7593030 no 1 dont be in a hurry take your time
7593031 no 2 if you see something that makes your heart pound buy it because it might not be there tomorrow
7593032 the ideology has become haircuts and white belts something has been lost in translation to hot topic
7593033 now it labels more of a pop punk movement i dont like people using it as such a broad term
7593034 the weird thing about emo becoming a popular music commodity is that a lot that was in there when it started has been annexed to make it more streamlined
7593035 i listened to neil young and hank williams and johnny cash and bob dylan more than panic at the disco and fall out boy
7593036 my music reflects that bands now and bands i grew up with thats what i hear
7593037 i can write a punk rock song and a folk song and a song thats just an indie rock song and have it all be kevin devine
7593038 its crazy to look back at it because i cant look back at the moment where it happened
7593039 i saw that there was enough of a response for me to travel and now there is no more office or restaurant this is what im doing professionally
7593040 it should be a quiet little evening of acoustic guitars and a no need for earplugs kind of show
7593041 one bus stopping every 20 minutes will not make a difference
7593042 the remote shuttle lot is part of the master parking plan but we may not need it
7593043 overall the parking departments changes really work and they are helpful for cutting down on traffic
7593044 however faculty with b parking tags still have difficulty finding spots
7593045 i would rather sleep in eat breakfast or drink coffee in that time
7593046 the next step is renovating existing lots and next summer the garage will start being built
7593047 we dont have any recorded explanation why he was denied tenure
7593048 such disregard for the collective judgment of the tenured faculty raises serious concerns about your relationship with the faculty
7593049 he called on kids just to pick on them and embarrass them
7593050 i really doubt this law school with its failure to care about the major problem it has in teaching when they have to bring professors from other nations to teach louisiana law
7593051 having taken you previously i noticed an improvement in your communications of the subject to students
7593052 when you are only given one chance to prove what you know but you are given an exam that is close ended there is a problem
7593053 in other classes we are given a chance to make up points
7593054 if were able to do it the way we would like to do it which is the complete building with large enough facilities for every part of our program it should be something that everybody here can be proud of
7593055 it was built for a band of 140 in 1959
7593056 the day it opened it was too small because there were 180 in the band
7593057 it does not reflect well right now on the university as far as recruiting goes
7593058 the big push came when john lombardi came on as president of the system
7593059 he got involved with this project because he was instrumental in the release of chancellor okeefe
7593060 the only issue was that the iphone at that time didnt have the settings that we were enforcing on our lsu network
7593061 i have gotten feedback from a few users that it is really easy to connect to lsusecure
7593062 we get more of a hit with laptops as students download big files or music files
7593063 the campus has enough capacity that we can handle a good number of devices
7593064 students are not choosing to buy the books they think they are way too expensive and they cant wait to get rid of them
7593065 in that case booksellers pay students based on the national wholesale value which is usually 10 to 30 percent of the selling price
7593066 usually the amount of books remaining when a new edition comes out is not sufficient in number to be adopted
7593067 most students like to go to class a few times before they buy their books anyway
7593068 if someone else is taking the same course as you why buy two books
7593069 if youve got one group thats right down the street doing the same thing that youre doing it kind of forces you to start thinking of some new things to do
7593070 many of us carry on more than one career outside of music
7593071 we met at the department of music and in the phi mu alpha music fraternity
7593072 i love the music of the michael foster project and the vibe of going to a show
7593073 you can relax to it and you can get absolutely silly with it
7593074 its understandable that a manufacturer might not reveal the existence of a kill switch but it was bound to come out
7593075 once someone discovered it theories were likely to pop up they obviously range from the benign to the malevolent
7593076 a manufacturer might want to be able to disable what it considered to be dangerous applications or applications that have gone out of control
7593077 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
7593078 this switch is a good thing because i definitely dont know which applications may be malicious or not
7593079 if i added an application that was harmful id want it to be gotten rid of pretty fast
7593080 when a customer buys a product like a cell phone she enters into a contract with the manufacturer or the service provider
7593081 she is signing up for that service and agreeing to certain terms regarding that service and expecting that the provider or the manufacturer will do the same
7593082 apple has a backup plan for if something bad does happen to me thats a good thing
7593083 or it might indicate that consumers dont understand what a kill switch might do we still need to examine those contracts we sign to see just what it is that we have agreed to receive
7593084 i am very proud to be representing the supreme court here today
7593085 i would be delighted to see my alma mater arguing a case before the louisiana supreme court
7593086 the centerpiece of our program is going to be the swearing in of our students because thats why we do what we do
7593087 the program will actually give me a glimpse of what being an attorney is like outside of the classroom
7593088 right now were just waiting on motions and trial dates
7593089 not just for my fans but for everyone else out there who hasnt heard of me but should be a fan
7593090 i would not put my name on a movie that was watered down
7593091 if its as good as the book itll be a badass movie
7593092 we all like to think we have great stories like that and thats what makes the book so cool
7593093 my current fans can expect this movie to be everything they want in a tucker max movie and more
7593094 our native louisiana crew base has increased by 400 percent since the program began in 2002
7593095 when guests reuse a paper bag they receive 05 off their bill for each bag and if they have reusable bags they receive 10 off their total for each bag
7593096 we used to have just a couple but now we have a lot more
7593097 and i figured it would be less useless garbage to pile up
7593098 ill tell you what makes me angry seeing my quarterback get off the ground
7593099 thats the thing thats hurting me right now to see carson getting hit
7593100 this was the type of game we kind of looked at as a unit
7593101 we wanted to have a good showing defensively they obviously didnt have their top guns
7593102 there wasnt much of a reason for students to leave campus
7593103 i used to eat there when i was in college in 1983
7593104 it was a tough personal decision but as a business decision it wasnt tough
7593105 its been there for a while a lot of people i know are sad about it
7593106 it was a cool place to hang out with a bunch of people especially on game day
7593107 i ate there only once and didnt like the food at all
7593108 i like how they always had their tvs on espn
7593109 weve had a good bit of people starting to come to the essen location
7593110 hopefully well be able to attract more students who like all you can eat pizza and the gattis product
7593111 lsu is the defending national champions so you are going to get everyones best shot
7593112 having a new quarterback will allow our running backs a fair share of carries but we are still going to throw the ball
7593113 he seems like an articulate guy and appears to have his head on his shoulders
7593114 quarterback is a tough position and hatch can be a good game manager
7593115 he has a lot to learn but hes been learning since last season
7593116 everybody wants tickets this year because we are defending national champions
7593117 with more than 10 billion per year in u s sales and an expected growth rate of nearly 10 percent per year for the foreseeable future the video game development industry is likely to be one of the most exciting growth sectors for many years to come
7593118 we hope that three or four years down the road we will get the development part of the game true developers
7593119 thats where the real high paying jobs are thats where the real research is thats when they sit around and dream up games that havent even been thought of
7593120 with our center for computation and technology we have some of the worlds most powerful computational power on campus and throughout the state
7593121 well develop this curriculum thatll be training the workforce that the industry needs
7593122 its going to attract the industry to come to town in this area and provide that opportunity for employment so students will have real life internships in the companies
7593123 ea would not have come to lsu if it wasnt for all of the work that had been done on campus
7593124 it really gave ea the confidence that they were going to be able to find qualified quality students who would do well in their qa program
7593125 people get the idea that youre getting hired to test games and that means youre just going to play games thats not what it is
7593126 the goal of the fair trade movement is to try to improve the lives of the farmers
7593127 we want them to make more money for the coffee they produce in order to send their kids to decent schools keep clothes on their backs and feed their kids if they can have decent lives it makes us feel better
7593128 i would be more inclined to shop at places that use fair trade programs because it is a good program
7593129 a partnership between producers and workers that seeks greater equity in international trade
7593130 i cant see how anyone would argue with the program so we dont label our products
7593131 we speak with the manufacturers and really try to do our homework so we can say the products we sell are actually fair trade
7593132 there were actually a few lines we really loved but after researching further the companies couldnt prove they were fair trade
7593133 we really feel like its important to know what were selling so we can assure anyone who comes in that what were selling is good
7593134 a lot of people dont understand why its important to buy from a fair trade or socially responsible company
7593135 by providing our business here in baton rouge we hope not only that we can make these products available to customers but also educate them on why its important
7593136 lsu students are forward thinking progressive and are a lot more knowledgeable about why this is all important
7593137 weve had a lot of students come in over the summer but were hoping that since the semester is approaching more students will come and take a look
7593138 deactivation of facebook is not a panhellenic council rule it is an individual chapter decision
7593139 basically the sororities say you better not converse not even on facebook
7593140 having these conversations may lead potential members to believe they have better connections and we want to protect that potential member from having additional contacts from other chapters
7593141 facebook was at the peak of its popularity and it was so easy to prove contact because all we had to do was print the page
7593142 our panhellenic president and our vice president of recruiting sit with the organization that has the violation filed against them and it depends on what those two entities decide
7593143 that is why it is called a mediation and not a hearing
7593144 we are aware of that and we just have to tell them this is not there to keep you from getting on facebook for social reasons it is there to help benefit our process
7593145 chapter members can assign someone in their chapter to check if everyone deactivated facebook
7593146 sometimes i do feel tempted to just log on very quickly but then get off again before anyone notices
7593147 i have to remember it is just for a short period of time that can seem like forever
7593148 there would literally be no time for a facebook sneak
7593149 its a good thing because we have so much to get done in so little time and facebook would be a distraction everyone i know on sorority row deactivated their facebook accounts
7593150 our outside midfielders are amazing and you know the ball is going to get to you
7593151 we just have to be ready for it the ball was bouncing around and i was ready for it to go past the defender so i could slot it in
7593152 we gave the ball away at the back a lot
7593153 south alabama worked really hard but we gave them a lot of chances on goal that were self inflicted it made us have to work a lot harder than we needed to
7593154 last year we had a solid back and thats what we build on
7593155 thats one of the top things we need to improve our pass and move needs to get better and we need to get in on every tackle every time but this is something we can build on
7593156 they beat florida state and florida state kicked our butts last year were going to have to move the ball around a lot faster
7593157 theres a lot of work to do these next couple days
7593158 the first time you play outside competition you learn a lot about yourself what you need to improve about yourself and what youre already good at well be back at practice for a couple of days to sharpen up and then weve got a big challenge monday night
7593159 we know our jobs and understand that we have to be here working out getting better and preparing for the season
7593160 you have to put your commitment to the team very high because summer is the time you get ready for the season
7593161 we did a great job this summer i think strength and conditioning coach tommy moffitt ran a great program and we were all able to benefit and prepare for the season
7593162 we had a program called speed city where wed run and do agility drills
7593163 i went up there played some golf and did some fishing
7593164 being here working out just getting all those mental reps that you can do during the summer benefit you so much
7593165 being here for the summer does nothing but positive things for us
7593166 this is definitely my first summer as far as i can remember when i didnt play baseball
7593167 baseball for summertime has probably been canceled out for the rest of my life because of football
7593168 it was weird not playing but it gave me extra free time that im not used to
7593169 i wanted to be on the field i wanted to be playing but my body got a good rest so it goes both ways
7593170 i wanted to spend a little bit more time with my family before the season starts
7593171 now it looks like i might not be home any time soon
7593172 i would have preferred to visit one of my former teammates who plays for the university of miami i had planned on going down there with him to spend a weekend or two but it was out of the plans
7593173 youve got summer school then you have workouts and conditioning and then you run right into two a days its tough but its something i love to do
7593174 still working at pamida married to todd with five kids
7593175 he humiliated his colleague by criticising him in front of the boss
7593176 lapertura della festa un atto ufficiale solenne che questanno assume un valore simbolico ancora pi alto dato che la prima festa del nuovo partito sar la prima volta sottolinea bettini che i militanti che vengono da diversi partiti e diverse culture potranno mescolarsi e misurarsi per limpresa comune rappresentata dal partito e dalla festa
7593177 solo una citt come firenze con la sua storia e la sua cultura ci poteva fare
7593178 sar una festa di intrattenimento di dialogo di confronto ma sar soprattutto una

7593186 im here endorsing senator mccain because i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation you know
7593187 but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do he had to be able to run the bases even though the crowd was jeering the first african american on the field
7593188 we are united we are united for change we are after all democrats so it might take awhile were not the fall in line party were diverse many voices but make no mistake we are united we are united on behalf of the democratic party the values we hold dear the reason we work so hard in politics to make the changes that we know will matter in the lives of hard working americans and for the future of our children and we are united behind barack obama and joe biden and we are gong to make sure that we win on november 4th
7593189 i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads
7593190 im hillary clinton and i do not approve of that message
7593191 we are gathered here in denver for a very clear and simple purpose and that is to come out of this convention energized excited and ready to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
7593192 the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate
7593193 abandoned their post will one soon day rot in hell
7593194 give me a second i gotta go kill these guys first
7593195 when i saw phillips die i looked down and was bleeding pretty good thats probably the most scared i was at any point
7593196 then i kinda had to calm myself down and be like all right i gotta go try to do my job
7593197 when you ask for volunteers to run across an open field to a reinforced op that almost everybody is injured at and everybody volunteers it feels good there were a lot of guys that made me proud putting themselves and their lives on the line so their buddies could have a chance
7593198 its usually three rpgs some sporadic fire and then theyre gone i dont where they got all those rpgs that was crazy
7593199 it was some of the bravest stuff ive ever seen in my life and i will never see it again because those guys
7593200 normal humans wouldnt do that youre not supposed to do that getting up and firing back when everything around you is popping and whizzing and trees branches coming down and sandbags exploding and rpgs coming in over your head it was a fistfight then and those guys held em off
7593201 just guys kicking ass basically just making sure that we look scary enough that you dont want to come in and try to get us
7593202 perhaps the most important takeaway from that encounter though is the one that the mainstream media couldnt be bothered to pay attention long enough to learn that not for the first time a contingent of american soldiers that was outnumbered by up to a twenty to one ratio soundly and completely repulsed a complex pre planned assault by those dedicated enough to their cause to kill themselves in its pursuit that kind of heroism and against all odds success is and has been a hallmark of americas fighting men and women and it is one that is worthy of all attention we can possibly give it
7593203 i just hope these guys wives and their children understand how courageous their husbands and dads were they fought like warriors
7593204 the first one died after he married my mother he took another wife he brought both to israel when he came to live here so i have a brother only three months older than i he is the cantor at our synagogue he taught me the cantillation

7593208 teacher i implore you look on my son for he is my only child
7593209 and behold a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth and it departs from him with great difficulty bruising him
7593210 so i implored your disciples to cast it out but they could not
7593211 o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and bear with you bring your son here
7593212 now these people had seen a work that the son did and it caused them to understand the majesty of god
7593213 let these words sink down into your ears for the son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men
7593214 whoever receives this little child in my name receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me for he who is least among you all will be great
7593215 master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we forbade him because he does not follow with us
7593216 do not forbid him for he who is not against us is on our side
7593217 lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them just as elijah did
7593218 you do not know what manner of spirit you are of
7593219 for the son of man did not come to destroy mens lives but to save them
7593220 foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
7593221 let the dead bury their own dead but you go and preach the kingdom of god
7593222 lord i will follow you but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house
7593223 no one having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
7593224 please let me kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow you
7593225 go back again for what have i done to you

7593242 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7593243 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7593244 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7593245 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7593246 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes

7593252 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasm the great devotion who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
7593253 definitively deprived the georgian leadership of the right to push for the south ossetian and abkhazian dependence on their adventurist polices which have led to a humanitarian catastrophe

7593263 the reader of this book who earnestly strives to follow its teachings so far as possible will be as near correct as it is possible to be in this imperfect wolrd we consider it a great pleasure and our special privilege to respectfully dedicate this volume to the colored race
7593264 oh i dont care nobody has anything to do with me
7593265 i have written nearly one hundred stories for this book and i have not said one word about the so called race problem
7593266 i know of course that the sufferings which are inflicted upon the colored people in this country are many and grievous lynchings are on the increase not only our men but our women are being burned at the stake what shall we do in spite of prejudice in spite of proscription in spite of nameless insults and injuries we cannot as a race afford to do wrong we can afford to be patient
7593267 the coalition against organized retail crime commends senator durbin for introducing this important piece of legislation
7593268 this legislation represents a long term effort to address the growth of this criminal activity and find real solutions to combat it
7593269 organized retail crime is a serious and growing national problem and the criminals associated with it pose real danger to communities
7593270 orc gangs are sophisticated and often use the profits of this crime to fund other criminal activities
7593271 the impact of orc is widespread and the current patchwork of state laws doesnt sufficiently address the problem
7593272 state and local law enforcement cannot always chase criminals across state lines and onto the internet and criminals know it this bill will update our laws to deal with orc as well as the growing problem of e fencing
7593273 this new legislation is a long overdue effort to bring u s criminal law into the 21 st century
7593274 e fencing is a major component of growth national problem of organized retail crime we commend chairman scott for his commitment to reducing instances of this crime and protecting consumers
7593275 organized retail crime and the online fences that support it pose a serious risk to consumers
7593276 it is unfortunate that the internet has become the most lucrative marketplace for reselling stolen goods and consumers have no way to check if the products they buy there are safe
7593277 without the a strong federal law addressing this crime and basic proactive steps taken by the online community organized retail crime will continue to rise

7593283 the acquiring of retail merchandise by illegal means for the purpose of reselling the items

7593285 without a secure supply chain and the anonymity of sellers consumers could easily be exposed to harmful products that have been potentially tampered with
7593286 a significant portion of this bill deals with on line fencing of stolen goods

7593320 i spent a career in law enforcement and saw firsthand the growing problem of organized retail crime in local communities the internet allows these criminals to expand their operations from the dark streets and pawn shops we all think about to millions of unsuspecting consumers living rooms in indiana and across the country
7593321 the bill will provide law enforcement officers and retailers with the tools they need to reveal the cloak of anonymity and bring these criminals to justice while at the same time preserving the online marketplace for law abiding citizens i am glad to work across party lines with congressman jordan to introduce it
7593322 organized retail crime is a growing problem that costs ohio retailers and consumers millions of dollars each year
7593323 i am proud to join my colleague mr ellsworth in this well balanced bill and applaud him for his leadership in combating this serious issue
7593324 this is a serious crime issue with real health and safety implications
7593325 rila strongly supports the introduction of the organized retail crime act of 2008
7593326 this bi partisan bill will provide law enforcement officials the tools they need to curtail orc and protect consumers from unknowingly purchasing fraudulent or unsafe consumer goods
7593327 this is a serious crime issue with real health and safety implications
7593328 without a secure supply chain and the anonymity of sellers consumers could easily be exposed to harmful products that have been potentially tampered with
7593329 rila applauds representatives ellsworth and jordon for their leadership on this important issue and their commitment to protecting the health and safety of consumers we encourage congress to act quickly to give law enforcement the tools it needs to aggressively prosecute these criminals and protect innocent consumers from unsafe or damaged goods

7593365 jika salah seorang di antara kalian berkeinginan keras untuk melakukan sesuatu maka hendaklah dia mengerjakan shalat dua rakaat di luar shalat wajib dan hendaklah dia mengucapkan ya allah sesungguhnya aku memohon petunjuk kepada mu dengan ilmu mu memohon ketetapan dengan kekuasan mu dan aku memohon karunia mu yang sangat agung kerana sesungguhnya engkau berkuasa sedang aku tidak kuasa sama sekali engkau mengetahui sedang aku tidak dan engkau maha mengetahui segala yang ghaib ya allah jika engkau mengetahui bahawa urusan ini kemudian menyebutkan langsung urusan yang dimaksud lebih baik bagi diriku dalam agama kehidupan dan akhir urusanku
7593366 baik dalam waktu dekat maupun yang akan datang maka tetapkanlah ia bagiku dan mudahkanlah ia untukku kemudian berikan berkah kepadaku dalam menjalankannya dan jika engkau mengetahui bahawa urusan ini buruk bagiku dalam agama kehidupan dan akhir urusanku
7593367 baik dalam waktu dekat maupun yang akan datang maka jauhkanlah urusan itu dariku dan jauhkan aku darinya serta tetapkanlah yang baik itu bagiku di mana pun kebaikan itu berada kemudian jadikanlah aku orang yang ridha dengan ketetapan tersebut beliau bersabda

7593377 mr elk would you like to purchase a t shirt
7593378 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatever you ask the father in my name he may give you
7593379 these things i command you that you love one another
7593380 if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you
7593381 if you were of the world the world would love its own yet because you are not of the world but i chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you
7593382 remember the word that i said to you a servant is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will keep yours also
7593383 but all these things they will do to you for my names sake because they do not know him who sent me
7593384 if i had not come and spoken to them they would have no sin but now they have no excuse for their sin
7593385 but in every nation whoever fears him and works righteousness is accepted by him
7593386 if i had not done among them the works which no one else did they would have no sin but now they have seen and also hated both me and my father
7593387 but this happened that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law they hated me without a cause
7593388 but when the helper comes whom i shall send to you from the father the spirit of truth who proceeds from the father he will testify of me
7593389 and you also will bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning

7593519 tomamos dois gols mas o s o paulo uma grande equipe e estamos mostrando para o que viemos no campeonato
7593520 estamos firmes e fortes na luta para terminar esse campeonato brasileiro entre os primeiros colocados garantindo a vaga na copa libertadores da am rica e quem sabe sendo campe es n o existe nenhum abatimento isso deve servir de li o para avan armos no que erramos
7593521 o botafogo abriu o marcador e acabou se acomodando com a vantagem foi um erro que vamos corrigir nos pr ximos jogos pois o ney sempre pede para que a gente continue jogando para frente mesmo com o placar a nosso favor por m trope amos num momento em que o nico preju zo foi termos deixado de ganhar algumas posi es n o deixamos a zona de classifica o para a copa libertadores e continuamos com a mesma vantagem para o l der gr mio
7593522 o botafogo n o soube furar a retranca do advers rio e se mostrou ansioso com isso mas n o podemos usar isso como uma desculpa para o trope o pois vamos enfrentar v rios advers rios assim pelo caminho mas agora damos uma parada no campeonato brasileiro e estamos focados na partida contra o atl tico mg que ser muito complicada apesar de termos uma boa vantagem
7593523 mais uma oportunidade de subirmos na tabela e quem sabe terminarmos a rodada na segunda coloca o encurtando a dist ncia para o gr mio mas o nosso pensamento est focado no jogo contra o atl tico mg e s depois de quarta feira que vamos pensar na melhor maneira de enfrentarmos o n utico
7593524 estou de volta ao werder bremen ap s conquistar a medalha de bronze ol mpica estou em condi es f sicas ideais para jogar em bom ritmo tamb m por isso fico disposi o do nosso treinador j para o duelo contra o borussia moenchengladbach
7593525 para n s ele continua sendo um jogador importante que demonstrou sua qualidade cada vez a cada partida da pr temporada n o sei o que ocorrer mas espero que ele solucione a situa o o mais r pido poss vel
7593526 acho que o elenco que temos atualmente muito bom al m disso h pessoas no clube que t m que decidir se vendem robinho ou n o e se contratam outros
7593527 o que decidirem no fim ser bom e estaremos todos para levar isso adiante e tentar conquistar o maior n mero de t tulos poss vel
7593528 estaria mentindo se falasse que n o penso em sele o o desejo de qualquer jogador j vesti a camisa amarelinha e sei o quanto isso significa para um jogador mas estou tranq ilo quanto a isso pois sei que fazendo o meu papel aqui no palmeiras serei lembrado de alguma forma o reconhecimento dos torcedores e at mesmo de voc s jornalistas j me deixa feliz
7593529 temos grandes jogadores para a posi o como o kl ber o marcelo que fez uma excelente olimp ada e o pr prio juan flamengo s o todos de timo n vel
7593530 o time cresceu muito esse ano e eu acompanhei essa evolu o al m disso a chegada do luxemburgo e da comiss o t cnica me ajudaram muito pois eles j me conheciam tudo colaborou para eu render acima do esperado
7593531 foi um ano espetacular n o apenas pelos t tulos conquistados mas pelas minhas atua es foi nesse ano 2003 que cheguei sele o brasileira

7593536 foi algo inadequado e direcionado pois hoje domingo vi uma torcida que veio at o pacaembu para apoiar e incentivar quem fez aquilo agiu de forma desnecess ria n o se pode caracterizar quem fez isso como a torcida do palmeiras
7593537 a expectativa de vencer como visitante com a minha chegada n o se confirmou e se criticarem o palmeiras deve ser feito em cima de mim n o do time pois nenhum clube com exce o do gr mio est vencendo fora de casa existe um equil brio e n o a realidade dizer que s o palmeiras n o vence fora
7593538 o daniel deu a cara para bater e foi criticado por n o estar nas melhores condi es f sicas n o vou exp lo uma segunda vez quando ele voltar ser por estar bem preparado

7593589 d j is extremely talented and catches the ball as well as any tight end ive ever been around
7593590 hes very hard to tackle and runs real well after the catch the thing i like most about him is that hes the guy who wants the ball in the critical situations on third down and in the red zone hes wanting his number to be called and wanting the opportunity to make the plays
7593591 were all on the same page when it comes to reading the defense before a snap count so we know we need to get our head around quick because the balls coming

7593620 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men
7593621 as more content is created for the female market women become dominant and drive most of the ad dollars

7593625 im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed

7593627 deanthony curtis the first day out there showed a great burst and really made things happen same thing with dennis johnson and i think those guys are going to have to carry the load and make things happen
7593628 we got a playbook here a foot thick in high school it was dennis johnson to the right dennis johnson to the left and dennis johnson up the middle
7593629 i thought dennis johnson with the young guys was real natural
7593630 deanthony curtis i mean weve got some talent back there its just a matter of continuing to work with them
7593631 adjusting to the speed here has been the challenge but it is still just catching the ball and running with it

7593643 the seemingly irresistible urge to espouse my views on sexual ethics
7593644 if i inherited this from my parents well who can blame me for that
7593645 i have been ridiculed called intolerant and fired from an academic post for my beliefs on this subject since no rational person in the united states in 2008 would choose to be anti gay if he didnt have to be it must not be a choice
7593646 i know this column might frustrate some people who will resist seeing how their arguments if true have helped me embrace my own unfashionable alternative beliefstyle

7593696 mccain has opposed every farm bill that has come before congress for more than a decade
7593697 we have closely studied the on line agricultural and rural policy statements of the two candidates and their voting records following a meeting with the obama campaign at our board conference in omaha last week the decision was clear to us acga endorses and supports the election of senator obama for president of the united states
7593698 at this time of great opportunity to rebuild not only rural america but all america through an aggressive national commitment to renewable energy of all kinds the voting record and policy statements of senator obama and senator mccain indicate very contrasting differences
7593699 while john mccain is a great man and a true hero he has built a very pronounced and consistent record on agriculture and ethanol during his twenty two years as a u s senator and it is perhaps the single most negative record of any senator
7593700 when compared to senator obama who supports the expansion of renewable energy such as advanced ethanol biodiesel and wind generated electricity our decision was obvious
7593701 acga has a long public record of supporting not only corn ethanol but also advanced ethanol from biomass and other non food and feed crops we see corn ethanol as the necessary initial building block for a vast expansion of renewable energy production of all kinds benefiting america as a whole by moving towards energy independence acga is also the leading national farm organization for the promotion and development of wind energy therefore we take this years election and our endorsement of senator obama very seriously
7593702 senator obama also supported the recently passed food conservation and energy act of 2008 or as it is commonly called the farm bill
7593703 farmers and rural voters understand the importance of farm bills these packages not only address agriculture and farms but cover the full dynamic scope of issues vital to rural america conservation trade rural development research nutrition rural credit and more in fact the new farm bill spends over 80 percent of its resources on non farm programs and rightfully does not even have farm in its title
7593704 so it is not lost on rural americans that senator mccain has opposed every farm bill that has come before congress for more than a decade it did not matter if the farm bills were written under republicans or democrats it did not matter if the farm bill came at a time when crop prices were high or low reflected policies that were liberal or conservative or stressed conservation rural development trade or research senator mccain opposed them all and publically demanded that president bush veto this years farm bill
7593705 i can say unequivocally as an illinois farmer that senator obama has exactly the same amount of experience in terms of time served in the illinois legislature and in the u s congress as another illinois lawyer who was elected president just as the nation was coming apart at the seams abraham lincoln senator obama is ready to lead america and the american corn growers wholeheartedly endorse him for president of the united states of america

7593711 there was a lot of expectation something would happen there on the night television channels were stalking around along with other media
7593712 it ended up a self fulfilling prophesy i question the effect of what they were doing

7593714 i dont accept that at all we cannot ignore a big news event like this
7593715 so far today ive heard it was the fault of the retailers selling alcohol the fault of the media and the fault of the police what ive not heard is that it was the fault of those involved
7593716 at this stage i dont know really how to deal with it
7593717 this gives us the breathing space to continue to lobby government for reasonable and sustainable funding for this essential specialist health care service while not impacting on our patients

7593719 i have been telling everybody we cant lose this service
7593720 we are screening all patients coming in for the rest of this week and are ringing everybody so that is quite time consuming
7593721 we have to build corporate and political structures that reflect the dream of intergenerational wealth because it is wealth that funds identity

7593725 we need to make sure we are making decisions based on the law not on what we think should happen
7593726 the councils district licensing agency and the police would come down hard on us we are always getting the message about cheap promotions

7593823 you can have a marginal well that makes significantly more than the 10 barrels or 60 mcf but because it produces a lot of saltwater or its very deep in nature it can be much more expensive income off that well becomes marginal even though the amount is larger
7593824 you can have a well thats real marginal but if you can get a tax break on the well it allows you to keep it pumping oil and gas
7593825 that is the objective of the legislation to make sure that even when prices are high you dont have to plug these wells that only produce a couple barrels per day
7593826 and we only have two that are not stripper wells even at the high prices for oil when you only produce a barrel every other day and you have saltwater to get rid of you get to the point where youre just not making any money on the well and eventually you end up plugging it
7593827 taken all together they still make a significant amount of oil and gas for our state and country
7593828 you get to the point where it doesnt do the government any good to tax you to a point where you have to plug that well even though the government always gets 7 percent gross production tax the income tax would be small or even nonexistent the government doesnt get any more money in forcing it to be plugged

7593847 recordings of supposedly confidential conversations involving a lawyer and a private investigator are being played in federal court in los angeles this month where attrorney terry christensen and private detective anthony pellicano are on trial for allegedly conspiring to wiretap the former wife of billionaire kirk kerkorian reports the los angeles times the trial is being closely followed in the legal community because it illustrates a type of relationship the public rarely sees that of a lawyer and his private investigator prosecutors say christensen paid pellicano to illegally wiretap lisa bonder kerkorian who was engaged in a bitter child support battle with his billionaire client kirk kerkorian christensen used information from the wiretap to gain a legal advantage in the case prosecutors allege
7593848 christensens defense team contends the attorney knew of no illegal wiretap arguing that pellicano could have been getting his information from sources other than a wiretap some attorneys say the case has made them more cautious about whom they hire and how they obtain their information no case is worth your career said ron litz who often deals with vicious divorce or child custody battles in which vengeful clients want to go after their spouses by any possible means now that we know that lawyers are going to be prosecuted for it like terry christensen we know that we have to keep that in mind and be more careful than in the past the national law journal called christensens case a wake up call for lawyers on how they use private investigators a lawyer can be held criminally liable for his investigators conduct only if he had knowledge of the illegal acts and acted with the intent of committing a crime said steven gruel a former federal prosecutor

7593873 i am not a member of an organized political party i am a democrat
7593874 the conclusions i came to were that most republicans and conservatives simply do not care about issues such as race gender and sexual orientation it is irrelevant
7593875 most republicans and conservatives simply do not care about issues such as race gender and sexual orientation
7593876 but it is not the democrats putting up anti this and anti that social bills on the state and local ballots every year
7593877 it is easier to address all questions before leaving the medical center than to try to find the answers at home
7593878 the prescribed post surgical care outlined by a childs surgeon usually includes bed rest to minimize the likelihood of bleeding pain or disruption of the surgical site
7593879 bed rest is also essential to preclude injuries due to falling or other accidents related to the effects of anesthesia
7593880 nausea and vomiting are common and can occur after general anesthesia it is also normal for children to experience some degree of pain and discomfort after surgery
7593881 cftc commissioner bart chiltons remarks were timely and crucial at a time when high crop prices and out of sync futures contracts on commodities are putting grain elevators and producers at risk
7593882 we greatly appreciate commissioner chiltons support for more transparency and information to help the ag industry deal with some of the credit and margin burdens they face because of high commodity prices
7593883 the grain industrys exposure to risk is tremendous and its ultimately going to be passed down the agriculture chain to farmers in the future unless we do something
7593884 closing loopholes and increasing transparency will ease a lot of concerns and help reduce that risk

7593888 if surgery is advised researching the best possible doctor and hospital for the child is essential
7593889 parents have many questions about the surgical procedure and almost always they first ask me where can i find a child surgeon
7593890 the more knowledgeable parents are about their childs condition the better they will be able to manage his or her care
7593891 regardless of the surgeons opinion if parents feel uncertain they should not hesitate to ask questions for further clarification
7593892 once the parents have developed confidence with the medical team and facility their child will sense their level of comfort
7593893 the parents will be able to express their support and love much more comfortably because their minds will not be preoccupied with as much uncertainty
7593894 parents are the vital link throughout the entire process of their childs surgery
7593895 physicians rely on these parents to familiarize themselves with all hospital policies especially those regarding visitation hours and accommodations
7593896 parents need to check with the staff before the surgery to be sure of any items that are not allowed in the patients room
7593897 preparing a child before and after a surgical procedure may sound like lot of work and a lot of responsibility
7593898 and it absolutely is parents are the ones who oversee all of the elements that are essential for the optimal care of their child
7593899 parents ask me all the time how do i prepare my child for surgery
7593900 once they have identified the surgeon and the medical facility where the surgery will take place preparations for the procedure will begin
7593901 what do you think is the hardest part about having an operation
7593902 which t shirt would you like to wear to the hospital
7593903 parents can greatly help their children anticipate what to expect and allay any anxiety by being loving and supportive

7593988 the conditions were great on the high tide and good on the low tide
7593989 it was a high tide sort of barrel sort of a huntington beachbreak set up and at low tide it was a softer right hand sand point on the mid tide was when things got crazy confusing and lots of top guys werent able to cope with the change and lost luckily i was surfing usually either at high or low tide

7593994 now that the bridge is open people can cross the bridge and get to the other side in five minutes

7593997 this has been an effort purely initiated by the ias and will help stimulate the local economy and increase the quality of life for people living in the area
7593998 these guys are doing an amazing job keeping the area secure
7593999 its a good place for families to go to and just relax and enjoy family time
7594000 the waves were really too small but still contestable and it made the final very hard as all four of us wanted to get the better rides i secured first place right at the beginning but it was very close all heat and it was not an easy one
7594001 i am focused on the top 2 finish to make it to the asp world junior championships wjc in narabeen
7594002 the asp europea title would be great off course but it is not really my main goal so i will stay focused on my surfing and training and see what happens
7594003 it was a long final and i felt under pressure
7594004 the 35 minutes were really long after i took my two best waves in the first five minutes and i was just sitting there watching the others surf and trying to stick to them for the priorities i am stoked to get that title
7594005 i have been on a good roll so far with a final in lacanau a 17th in the wqs now this win
7594006 things are going my way and it is so good to make it through that many heats i cannot wait to paddle back out next week and try and get another good result
7594007 the conditions were really difficult and it was all about tactics
7594008 i tried to battle as hard as i could but the waves just went to alizee arnaud it was a good event with a great day yesterday and the level was high so i am happy with the result it is my best result this year so i am pretty satisfied
7594009 i did not catch the better waves during the final and i was not able to show my best surfing
7594010 i even had an interference penality so i am pretty stoked to still get a second place it is excellent for my top 5 goal and i will be waiting patiently for the final event in portugal in october

7594094 externalities in the classroom how children exposed to domestic violence affect everyones kids
7594095 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
7594096 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict
7594097 there are many reasons for disruptive classroom behavior domestic violence is one particularly good indicator of a troubled child

7594104 weve been preparing for 15 months and we feel very confident
7594105 we need to have the highest level of security at these venues but we try very hard and go to great length to make sure that these venues are as successful as possible
7594106 we dont plan on shutting down the city we want the city to do business and thrive throughout the event
7594107 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7594108 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7594109 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7594110 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7594111 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7594112 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
7594113 part of the reason im deploying people like that is so people feel comfortable
7594114 because i think there is some anxiety about the size of the event the fact that the federal government is involved people have read a lot of things theyve seen things in other countries i want them to feel comfortable
7594115 it doesnt make people feel safer it makes them more tense people feel like something is definitely going to happen

7594122 ever since i was little my parents knew there was something a bit different about me and growing up in the states they didnt exactly know where to put me because i wasnt autistic i didnt have cerebral palsy i was failing every subject and teachers were bullying me other students
7594123 something as simplistic as getting dressed in the morning was quite difficult so id show up to class late
7594124 and i remember when i was seven i put my jeans on in the wrong direction inside out
7594125 imagine having problems with depth perception and trying to do geometry or lining up numbers
7594126 i cant judge which way the arrows should go and which way it should go in
7594127 these are not children who are just low in athletic ability
7594128 they are children who are having difficulty with everyday activities like buttering bread turning a key in the lock printing cutting combing their hair just doing everyday activities
7594129 its helpful to families when they recognize that their children are struggling to know that the children are not going to get worse that its not a degenerative condition
7594130 in fact the children are going to develop some skills over time and therefore they will seem better
7594131 if people realize how hard it is for them to do the motor aspect of tasks and they understand it theres lots of ways around many tasks

7594229 im disappointed for our football team but im also disappointed for him
7594230 hes a guy that was on our practice squad last year worked his tail off all off season and was really having a good camp and had a strong possibility of making our football team hes a guy that my heart goes out to because i know thats tough but if he works like that he will be back next year

7594243 it is clean no smut but there is a really great kiss it is a romance after all
7594244 it is religious but not preachy it shows the simplicity of living the faith one believes as a straight forward part of life without trying to explain why or convice anyone i personally loved that
7594245 the characters are real stubborn faulty and true to life
7594246 brenda coulter has given us a wonderful love story of two people who are considered heroes in the eyes of others but both have doubts about that this is a great read
7594247 along with a top notch story brenda gives the reader interesting peeks into the life of an army nurse and a helicopter pilot having a strong army background myself i can vouch for brendas authenticity brendas characters live breathe and overcome real situations the topic is serious but the writing is funny and keeps the reader glued to the story to the very last word
7594248 i enjoyed getting to know maddie and jake and watch as their relationship moved forward tied together by an orphaned boy with a heart problem caused by a bomb that killed his mom ali is a sweetheart and both maddie and jake are instrumental in getting ali the care he needs dont miss at his command it is a winner
7594249 brenda coulter has written an entertaining read she starts off her book with a great hook and continues her witty phrasing of words throughout the book a truly enjoyable read
7594250 what a sweet romance the characters were immediately likeable and sympathetic and though there are some painful moments in the book brenda balances them with a nice dose of humor this is the first book of hers ive read and i really liked it not only was the characterization great i could practically hear the texas twangs but she used lovely metaphors and her writing style is active and smooth plus the first kiss actually i think it was the second but lets just say the first real kiss was great i loved that scene
7594251 the way his resistance to the heroine came across was harsh personally i felt he was too callous with maddie several times in the story so much so that when the two leads finally reconciled the potential romance wasnt believable because he didnt seem repentant enough i think if hed given in to at least one instance where he felt compassion after pushing maddie away that would have helped

7594603 i remember being very dizzy and i couldnt stop vomiting
7594604 i had to wait in the hospital for my eye pressure to go down and for all the blood to drain out of my eye

7594614 we are excited about the release of psilo which was developed to address an important need in the life science industry to centralize organize and share macromolecular structure data often research scientists do not have timely and easy access to crystallographic nmr and computational structure data from their colleagues with psilo all structural data whether proprietary or public is centralized and searchable using a web browser scientists can be automatically notified of new structures related to their research as soon as they become available
7594615 macromolecular structure data is important intellectual property for a research organization and it makes sense to safeguard it in a central repository managed in accordance with it best practices psilo provides the means to do this using standard database and intra net infrastructure
7594616 whether experimental or theoretical macromolecular structure is highly complex and it is difficult for depositors to resolve all uncertainties psilo allows users to store comments or report perceived problems with deposited structures the authors of the structures are automatically notified and can respond or deposit a new corrected version of a structure this collaborative community improvement mechanism is standard in the software industry and we believe that it will be of great value in the structural scientific community to improve the quality of macromolecular structure data

7594676 black keys and jay reatard at first avenue in minneapolis
7594677 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face

7594679 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7594680 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7594681 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7594682 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7594683 potensi korupsi pada kebijakan strategis jauh lebih besar daripada potensi korupsi yang muncul dari pembukuan keuangan lembaga negara
7594684 dpr tidak mungkin mengawasi bi karena kemampuan dpr terbatas hanya bpk yang bisa mengawasi bi secara intensif

7594690 kebetulan saya lahir dan melewatkan masa kecil di cilacap tahun 1990 1994 saya juga terlibat dalam pengorganisasian buruh perkebunan dan petani daerah itu sehingga saya relatif tidak kesulitan masuk ke cilacap dan banyumas dan memperjuangkan aspirasi warga kedua daerah itu jika kelak akhirnya dapat duduk di dpr
7594691 saya masuk politik praktis dalam hal ini parpol karena untuk menciptakan perubahan yang nyata dibutuhkan kekuatan politik jika dahulu saya berjuang lewat demonstrasi sekarang semoga dapat melalui dpr
7594692 salah satu rekomendasi pertemuan nasional pena 98 pada juni 2007 adalah berusaha masuk ke ruang politik legal untuk memastikan ada perubahan seperti yang diharapkan sebab setelah direfleksikan gerakan kami selama ini punya satu kekurangan yaitu kami tidak punya kemampuan untuk melaksanakan kebijakan kami mencoba mengatasi masalah itu dengan masuk ke parlemen
7594693 dalam politik tidak ada kawan atau lawan abadi selain itu keterlibatan mereka dalam kasus itu sudah selesai secara hukum
7594694 mereka yang mengaku reformis sekarang sikapnya juga banyak yang sama dengan orde baru keras kepala dan otoriter jadi akhirnya semua tergantung orangnya dengan komitmennya
7594695 selain ingin belajar kebetulan ada peluang kuota 30 persen perempuan sehingga saya memanfaatkannya
7594696 para hakim konstitusi akan diberikan kebebasan sepenuhnya untuk bekerja berdasarkan konstitusi dan bebas dari tekanan pihak mana pun
7594697 saya percaya jika para hakim diberikan kebebasan dalam bekerja putusan putusannya akan dapat sesuai dengan konstitusi
7594698 mahkamah konstitusi juga mesti meneguhkan prinsip imparsialitas di bawah kepemimpinan yang baru ini
7594699 para hakim harus menjauhkan diri dari preferensi preferensi politik yang dapat memengaruhi produk produk putusan mereka

7594703 ada permintaan dari yppi untuk menggunakan lahan bi lalu saya berpikir untuk mengompensasikan dengan pinjaman rp 100 miliar itu saya lalu minta ketemu ketua bpk saat itu ketua bpk mengiyakan untuk kompensasi bagi rp 31 5 miliar uang dari yppi dengan tanah bi di kemang
7594704 saya katakan kembalikan uang yppi ini saya memberikan waktu dari juli 2005 saya baru lapor ke kpk november 2006
7594705 saya panggil paskah karena dia punya pengaruh besar di dpr saya katakan ada masalah ini kembalikanlah uang itu malu kalau seperti ini apa jawab paskah dia mengatakan burhanuddin yang harusnya menyelesaikan saya katakan ya bicarakanlah dengan dia saya juga mengatakan ke paskah setelah kalian bayar saya sebagai ketua bpk punya hak untuk menyebutkan uang itu sudah dikembalikan sehingga tak ada kerugian negara
7594706 saya sempat menyampaikan keberatan jika harus meminjam uang dari yppi tetapi dalam hidup kita harus bertoleransi kepada teman jadi itu alasan saya kenapa saya ikut tanda tangan
7594707 untuk dana resmi bi ada kontraknya kalau dana dari yppi tak ada kontraknya

7594709 proses pembelajaran ini seharusnya dilakukan sebelum tahapan pemilu bukan pada saat prosesnya berjalan
7594710 kader partai tidak perlu marah jika ditempatkan di nomor urut bawah bila sudah ada sistem skor yang sama
7594711 mau menerima hasil proses demokrasi juga merupakan kedewasaan karena mengenal ambang batas dirinya itu sebabnya partai perlu juga menghargai kader partai yang tetap di partai meski tidak masuk daftar caleg
7594712 namun dalam proses penyusunan caleg memang harus ada keseimbangan antara kader partai yang berkembang dalam institusi partai dan mereka yang diambil dari tokoh di luar partai
7594713 alangkah lebih baik jika dalam undang undang ada klausul yang memberikan kebebasan kepada partai untuk menentukan sendiri sistem yang akan dipakai dalam proses pemilihan anggota legislatif
7594714 tni seharusnya langsung diberi mainan baru salah satunya dengan memenuhi kebutuhan persenjataan mereka namun hal itu sulit terwujud jika kemampuan anggaran pertahanan negara masih seperti sekarang

7594811 we kept them to a few chances they had a lot of the ball but not loads of chances
7594812 they only needed one chance and they had the right man to get it it was the wrong man for us though

7594817 people do miss penalties but since i have been manager of bolton we have missed the three penalties we have had all with different takers
7594818 we have got to start scoring from those opportunities a fair result is neither here nor there
7594819 we had an opportunity to get something from the game and i feel win the game but we didnt take that
7594820 we are internally unable to estimate the effect on sales going forward
7594821 our primary responsibility and need at this stage has been to remove the recalled products from the market weve provided the list of products and weve been in direct contact and have talked with every single one of the customers and distributors that have received and distributed that product
7594822 we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility

7594835 went to law school on a full academic scholarship the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship
7594836 i did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school and my recollection of this was inacurate
7594837 i graduated from the university of delaware with a double major in history and political science
7594838 mr biden received a single b a in history and political science
7594839 with regard to my being the outstanding student in the political science department
7594840 my name was put up for that award by david ingersoll who is still at the university of delaware

7594843 it is not important whether inflation touches the 13 per cent mark but the fact that it will start moderating within three to four months

7594856 ultimately this is up to the filmmakers to decide if theres a legitimate demand someone will serve it conversely organizations that are failing are doing so because they offer services that are no longer valued supported or they cannot find funding to cover to cost of the costly slate of services on the menu
7594857 rather than attempting to serve a filmmakers every need an information age non profit organization needs to be able to direct a filmmaker to the source of services they seek the organization and its constituents are better served if you identify quality strategic partners who can provide the services better than you can its a win win win
7594858 filmmakers should speak up more about what they really need and what they are willing to pay for
7594859 as it stands now the bulk of our services are paid for by private donors via celebrity events and government grants i would feel more secure if we had a wider base of smaller donors how do you convert people who value independent film into valuing their local media arts organization and paying their dues

7594872 no youre just fat and a writer theres not much more to be said is there
7594873 having a national ticket that is unapologetically pro life is essential to motivating republican voters
7594874 john mccain can pick a pro life running mate and win
7594875 all polling shows what has been the key has not been just the fact of over performing among independents as important as that has been its been the republican grass roots coming home
7594876 when you look at the poll numbers the numbers of middle moderate republicans and even disenfranchised hillary clinton voters far outnumber the few votes at the very very right
7594877 we have the numbers to prove it now and the mccain campaign knows this
7594878 im a strong advocate for joseph lieberman as a republican vice presidential nominee
7594879 he was a bad vp candidate for us and he might as well be a bad vp candidate for them
7594880 the real question is not whether hell win more moderate votes than he will lose but will he win enough moderate votes in states like michigan ohio colorado virginia and florida
7594881 those are the big ones if he loses you conservative votes in wyoming it doesnt matter
7594882 conservatives in the republican party have done everything they can to tell john mccain they dont want a pro choice candidate but lieberman has very good numbers nationally and hes well known the issue isnt whether it disrupts the convention but where john mccain is on sept 15
7594883 once this is over i hope we can come together again and find common ground
7594884 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7594885 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7594886 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7594887 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7594888 he is our brother and we must struggle to free all prisoners

7594891 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
7594892 it was there in what the greeks called mesopotamia that life as we know it today began there people first began to speculate on philosophy and religion developed concepts of international trade made ideas of beauty into tangible forms and above all developed the skill of writing
7594893 the heirs of a great civilization that contributes to all humanity
7594894 the larger goals of u s strategy depend on separating the vast majority of non violent muslims from the radical militant islamist jihadists but american efforts have not only failed in this respect they may also have achieved the opposite of what they intended
7594895 youd have to go back centuries to the mongol invasion of baghdad in 1258 to find looting on this scale

7594897 i thought i was given assurances that sites and museums would be protected

7594899 merit securing as soon as possible to prevent further damage destruction and or pilferage of records and assets
7594900 coalition forces must secure these facilities in order to prevent looting and the resulting irreparable loss of cultural treasures
7594901 our troops who have been proudly guarding the oil ministry where no window is broken deliberately condoned these horrendous events
7594902 opened its second burger king at tallil the new facility co located with a pizza hut provides another burger king restaurant so that more service men and women serving in iraq can if only for a moment forget about the task at hand in the desert and get a whiff of that familiar scent that takes them back home
7594903 there was danger in disturbing ancient monuments it was both wise and historically important to reverence the legacies of ancient times ur was a city infested with ghosts of the past and it was prudent to appease them

7594917 must be very close to their lowest level in the 1992 shortage
7594918 whether to stand him down or sack him were always considerations for the club and the board and the coaching staff
7594919 at this point in time we dont have all the facts and obviously its important that we do have all the facts before any further action is determined
7594920 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and i would say its highly unlikely hed play again this year
7594921 certainly if these allegations are proven then we are certainly into the territory of looking at not only his future at that club but his future in the game
7594922 obviously these are very serious allegations its now a matter for the courts but i certainly support the action of the sharks in standing the player down
7594923 it is a bit of a kick in the teeth luckily ive still got my teeth
7594924 from what i understand it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7594925 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said that he would be strongly denying the allegations
7594926 without greg birds qualities as a footballer it makes it a lot tougher for us its another obstacle we have to face
7594927 i jumped up and went to say you stupid bloody and was going to say a swear word but i never got to say it because somebody stepped out with a gun

7594934 ich sage euch als jemand der den widerstand die hisbollah und seine m glichkeiten und seine quantitative und qualitative entwicklung nach dem krieg im juli 2006 kennt die zionisten da werden viel zeit brauchen und nicht tausendmal sondern zig tausendmal nachdenken bevor sie den libanon angreifen
7594935 im zweiten libanonkrieg hatten wir sehr viel massivere mittel und f higkeiten deren einsatz wir vermieden haben da wir gegen eine terrororganisation und nicht gegen einen staat gek mpft haben wenn der libanon zum hisbollah staat wird werden wir uns in dieser hinsicht keinerlei beschr nkungen mehr auferlegen
7594936 die heutige bewilligung des haushalts wird die konomische stabilit t st rken die die israelische wirtschaft braucht insbesondere zu einer zeit wirtschaftlicher abk hlung und politsicher unsicherheit dies ist eine wichtige errungenschaft f r die regierung die damit verantwortung bewiesen und sich f r die fortsetzung einer wirtschaftspolitik entschieden hat die konsistent und klar ist und das gleichgewicht zwischen den unterschiedlichen konomischen bed rfnissen wahrt
7594937 die regierung israels hat entschieden einen wandel im konomischen schwerpunkt herbeizuf hren um die zukunft der entlegenen regionen des landes zu sichern der plan wird das wachstum f rdern die sozialen gr ben verkleinern und er bietet eine umfassende sozio konomische vision die entscheidend ist f r die zukunft israels und seiner wirtschaft

7594939 senator kennedy is in denver and plans to attend tonights tribute to him hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7594940 this is the most inclusive convention in our partys history
7594941 every single diversity number has gone up across every single group that were proud to have as members of our democratic family
7594942 this survey shows that rank and file democrats understand the importance of trade and free markets to our economic future
7594943 congress appears out of touch with the american voter when congress returns to washington after the conventions lawmakers should immediately pass the colombian trade agreement and demonstrate to the world that as a great nation the united states does not fear overseas competition

7594945 in 2004 81 6 percent of registered 18 29 yr olds turned out to vote
7594946 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
7594947 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
7594948 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
7594949 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
7594950 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
7594951 thats probably still one of my proudest accomplishments the result of those suits led to growth management practices countywide
7594952 keep in mind this is what we are working on now
7594953 weve landed cal state san marcos here and got them open
7594954 weve also had concordia and mt san jacinto come to temecula as well as redlands college come to murrieta the goal is not that temecula land every college campus but that we have higher education in the region its an extremely important economic development tool
7594955 the hospital was approved in 2006 the legal hurdles were overcome and now we have to hold their hand through the end of the process
7594956 the hospital is not only vitally important to the health care needs of the region but it will also bring jobs here
7594957 in the past nine years weve accomplished a great deal of victories but there is a lot left to do temecula is one of the premier cities in the state of california and in order to stay that way we can never rest on our laurels
7594958 ive always enjoyed politics and i have thousands of people who have asked me to run again
7594959 my main issue is that money can be spent without voter approval i dont have a problem with free enterprise but i would rather see individually initiated development rather than city sponsored development
7594960 were running out of land if we dont do it soon were going to paint ourselves into a corner
7594961 if we had more local jobs wed have less traffic
7594962 why not spend the same amount of time and money to help provide stable incomes for our residents as the city did to pay for a new garage at the mall
7594963 in all those areas we should promote entice woo whatever it is going to take to get those jobs to the city
7594964 i think that would be money well spent by the city
7594965 those races featured some of the biggest boneheads and voting for any of them was a complete waste of time
7594966 it doesnt take a dollar to get a vote it takes people voting for you
7594967 passing my campaign around by word of mouth is the greatest endorsement i could get
7594968 in the early 1990s we had people directing traffic on rancho california road
7594969 that was a time when there were fewer cars on the road but traffic congestion was worse in the intervening years there have been improvements to managing the traffic
7594970 the larger picture is to position ourselves to secure resources to get those things done
7594971 with the issue of higher education comes the question of how do we create a nurturing environment for our youth as they grow so they have the best opportunity to reach their fullest potential
7594972 being a city leader is not all bricks and mortar projects its being out in the community
7594973 the job is so in depth it just fills your life i just want to keep going while i have the energy and passion it fills me with that good sense that ive done something right
7594974 im running again because the job is fun and rewarding to do and there are things that still have yet to be done
7594975 er is niet de manier om een project met xp en scrum aan te pakken en zoals wij de schrijver en zijn teams het doen is niet per definitie de juiste manier zelf zegt hij misschien vind je onze werkwijze wel waardeloos maar we kunnen in ieder geval leren van zijn ervaringen

7594981 si no hay normas ocurren estas irregularidades hay que prohibir que el jefe del estado participe en actos proselitistas

7594985 why would they use you instead of these other agents
7594986 i need to do more research before i make this call

7595145 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
7595146 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7595147 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
7595148 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
7595149 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
7595150 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7595151 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7595152 it also says since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable looks like pelosi didnt study the subject long enough but not to worry we are sending her a copy of catholicism for dummies today
7595153 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not
7595154 my republican colleagues do not support contraception if you want to reduce the number of abortions and we all do we must it would behoove you to support family planning and and contraception you would think
7595155 i love bill clinton but can you imagine being vice president

7595157 at the end of the day the convention will go smoothly

7595172 it definitively caused the problem yet reported no detectable errors
7595173 over the course of the day we began experiencing similar problems in peripheral databases until our shipping system went down
7595174 one of the surgeons said to me you would have to demonstrate that you would be prepared to be sterilized if you are serious about doing surgery
7595175 when i was at school i wanted to be a marine biologist
7595176 im the sort of person who if they want to make it
7595177 while i was there i decided i didnt want to go back to research i wanted to become a practicing doctor at first people were supportive and thought heres this really intelligent woman whos got an oxford degree and we could really use her as a general practitioner
7595178 and they started to treat me as if i had a psychiatric condition i was unable to get a job in the uk training as a basic intern so i had to travel to hong kong that was easier than doing battle with the men who were trying to discourage me from doing surgery
7595179 one of the surgeons in london said to me you would have to demonstrate that you would be prepared to be sterilized if you are serious about doing surgery its an all encompassing life you dont have time to go and do ridiculous things like taking care of babies
7595180 i got up and walked out of the room and said i didnt want to have to work for anyone who hadnt had to prove himself by having a vasectomy of course i got to the door and thought to myself what do i do if he says he has
7595181 he hadnt and i ended up working in hong kong
7595182 during the time i was there i met my husband he was developing his career as a urologist and he needed to be back in the uk for further training so he left and eventually i followed him back and very soon after that we got married and i had my first child
7595183 after returning from practicing in hong kong i still knew wanted to do surgery
7595184 im sure and i dont see any reason why i cant do it
7595185 people were saying are you sure you know youve got the baby as if its the sort of thing youd forget
7595186 my answer was yes im sure and i dont see any reason why i cant do it
7595187 up until that point everything had been very successful for me i had been a consultant for seven years and that was probably the most satisfying career point in my life things were going well
7595188 although i had experienced sexist behavior before the men i worked with there had never exhibited any sexist behavior to me whatsoever they were incredibly supportive and the whole of our department was more like a even look after our colleagues kids
7595189 right at that time the bbc were chasing after me for a documentary on women who had been successful in the nhs of four women i was chosen to represent hospital surgery and in hospital medicine
7595190 it was a pretty huge thing for the bbc but i was actually very naive i thought this documentary would be a one day wonder and that everybody would have forgotten about it by the time i got back to work i took a short break over the summer
7595191 that wasnt the case it was an amazingly successful documentary the people who did it won awards for it it was just incredible
7595192 i still get patients who will say to me i wrote your name down when i saw the documentary and ive kept it since then youre the only person i would have operating on me
7595193 during the time that i was away over the summer a new surgeon came in he was a good technical surgeon but he had a big problem with women
7595194 he made the whole of the rest of the department feel threatened by me which had never happened before we dont want to be in a unit that is only famous because it has women in it he would say
7595195 the whole unit which had been so friendly just disintegrated into an us and them there were people being pushed into one team or another
7595196 i just didnt see this huge change coming and i didnt take defensive action
7595197 suddenly one day i was called in and they started telling me that i was incompetent
7595198 they were so clever about it one of the junior doctors said i think it would be a good idea if all the consultants gave us a lecture on the things that they had learned from their own mistakes a very clever way to get me to be completely open about every one of my mistakes as a surgeon
7595199 over fourteen years every surgeon whos busy operating on a thousand cases per year has mistakes and i opened up about mine so that people could learn from them
7595200 instead they actually took detailed notes of these patients and put them together into a horrendous dossier which they then presented to the management
7595201 right at that time a nigerian trainee came to me since i was her women in surgery rep to tell me that one of the consultants had been blatantly racist against her she asked me what she should do
7595202 i told her that if she made an official racist complaint it would be very hard for her but i told her that if thats what she wanted to do i would stand fully behind her
7595203 the next day she came back with a written complaint and said lets go for it so i backed her
7595204 within ten days of that event i was suspended and accused of incompetence
7595205 it was very obvious to everybody who had been open minded and reasonable for the previous years that this was a way for the new regime to get rid of me because at that time i was very popular and quite famous from the bbc documentary and i was threatening their ability to have a private practice they hadnt yet actually established a loyal patient following
7595206 i spent nearly two years not working for the nhs they even messed up the way they suspended me the private hospital said unless youre suspended were quite happy for you to continue working for us
7595207 so i was actually in quite a bizarre situation all these inquiries were going on and people were trying to figure out if i was actually incompetent or not while all the private patients were still coming to see me
7595208 which of course made these men even more determined to get rid of me
7595209 eventually i got a lawyer and i took the case to a tribunal
7595210 there were people who had not been to see him in nine years suddenly turning up on the doorstep and saying oh its so lovely to have tea with you gerald
7595211 he told them that they obviously didnt know his wife
7595212 finally we went to the tribunal and after a long process we settled
7595213 what ive lost by having to leave at 50 was the opportunity to become a professor ive always had this idea that the pinnacle of my career would have been to be the first woman professor of plastic surgery in the uk but that wont happen now
7595214 at least ive had a much less stressful life by being in private practice rather than in the nhs for the last few years
7595215 i see them every day but i was just absolutely determined that no matter what was going on in my soul they would see me going down the corridor smiling at them and being polite and all those sorts of things it hurt them a lot that they havent managed to get rid of me
7595216 i still get junior doctors coming to me and saying weve been around for three or four years and youre the first person whos ever spoken to us in a positive way about continuing a career in surgery
7595217 ive done projects with my colleagues where weve gone into schools for example and we meet up with the girls who are applying to medical school
7595218 they seem to be put off at different stages they start off really determined to be surgeons but it seems the more and more men they talk to the less and less they want to be surgeons
7595219 youre the first person whos ever spoken to us in a positive way about continuing a career in surgery
7595220 it left me in some ways lacking confidence in some ways looking over my shoulder waiting for the next stab wound but i made an absolute decision at the beginning that i would not tolerate myself becoming bitter
7595221 so every time i caught myself being bitter i just made a decision to stop
7595222 i have tried to look at the positives that have come out of my rather unplanned career path and i tried to make it feel like a small part of life and the big issues like my husband and children were still the most important things in life
7595223 when i turned up for my surgeons exam seven months pregnant the first question i was asked was what makes you think you have the right to present yourself looking like that
7595224 i actually let the examiner upset me he was very aggressive and i became flustered i failed an exam which i shouldnt have failed
7595225 now i tell women that when they go for the exam the exam will be fair there wont be any bias against them theyve just got to be as good as everybody else theres no longer any prejudice against women in the exams partly because im an examiner and i simply wont tolerate it
7595226 what makes you think you have the right to present yourself looking like that
7595227 what we need is for those women to then go on to committees to help in planning the future of medicine to be able to prevent even more discrimination of women
7595228 we have to make surgical training something that is desirable and friendly towards women and theres a lot of work that needs to be done before it can just be regarded as the norm for women to be surgeons
7595229 in terms of something you can start doing today one of the reasons that i was able to take on the claims against me with confidence is that somewhere along the line somebody told me that the path would be hard for a woman especially a successful woman
7595230 so when people were accusing me of something like not being at work i could show that the reason i wasnt at work on monday was because i was representing the hospital interviewing junior doctors in the regional headquarters
7595231 so i would also give that advice to trainees just have a big diary and keep it forever write down that on tuesday morning you came into work at 8 oclock you did this this and this and you left at 9 oclock in the evening
7595232 it sounds a terrible thing to have to do but if youre in the habit of writing a little diary every day and just filing it away at the end of each year it can be very useful in non confrontational settings as well as settings in which it can be career saving
7595233 the amount of earnings a worker must give up for gaining health insurance is roughly equal to the amount an employer must pay for such coverage
7595234 people generally like to equate better health with awesomer technology but developing a slightly better drug for late stage cancer a good profitable innovation will do much less for health than getting the flu vaccine to everyone who needs it or creating systems so everyone with elevated cardiac risk is on statins these interventions are low innovation but actually extremely effective saving some level of money on innovation in order to rechannel it to access and basic interventions would probably make the country a whole lot healthier but i dont think youre allowed to say that

7595248 its a place for sellers and brokers to post real estate listings and for buyers to browse and search them but unlike some other systems weve designed the marketplace to feature big beautiful photographs and a blog style layout of properties perfect for perusing were hoping this makes discovering a property and selling one a pleasure
7595249 the idea behind the marketplace isnt to aggregate every listing from every random brokerage in the city were not crawling other sites for our data its input by brokers or sellers themselves rather were aiming to create an exchange in which a lack of sheer volume is made up for in quality of the listings and the pleasure of the browsing experience

7595260 but there are ups and downs the little doubts get bigger and then you wonder if youll make another one
7595261 there are so many ups and downs and its so different competitive golf and just playing around
7595262 it helped me get the putter going again being home for a month was so nice
7595263 i played in dauphin a few times and broke the course record twice
7595264 i had a lot riding on it i was 100th on the list and putting a lot of pressure on myself trying to get into that top 80
7595265 it was a learning experience i was in the fourth last group my name was on the leader board i waited all year to see my name on that board so of course i was watching that
7595266 all of that helped me coming into mississauga you just never give up and learn from your mistakes
7595267 i was pretty pumped on the weekend because i had thought id missed the cut
7595268 i just told myself on saturday there was no longer any point to being scared
7595269 in montreal for ryan thats just part of the learning curve and now the one thing hes probably learned is that everybody gets nervous
7595270 in the first half we were out of the game inter were doing well theyre a different team compared to last season
7595271 we didnt understand their style of play in the first half but the second half went better
7595272 there are small problems to resolve but the new arrivals will help us with that
7595273 when the league starts on sunday we must play like we did in the second half
7595274 if he took it then he must have felt like he would convert it he played thirty minutes and showed that he has recovered
7595275 there is a contract there ive spoken to the chairman and when we get around to doing it it is available to do
7595276 given the circumstances of conceding an early goal and having a man sent off it was never going to be easy for us so the way we played in the second half never giving up until wed secured an equaliser was totally praiseworthy
7595277 we can be very satisfied with a 1 1 draw after going a goal and a man behind
7595278 weve played more than an hour with ten men so it rates as a very good display especially in the second half
7595279 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7595280 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7595281 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7595282 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7595283 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men mark noble was sent off so early i felt we were in control
7595284 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7595285 ipswich have made us a written offer that was not bad but we will not sell novakovic

7595301 you got me goin again baby you got me goin again you make me sick
7595302 it was amazing the team worked very hard but it was difficult because valencia are a great team we knew how to overcome adversity because we are a quality side we are very happy and we want to enjoy this title i am delighted
7595303 i had never experienced such a comeback in my entire career it shows the great sprit the team has we knew we had to thrill our fans tonight they were spectacular
7595304 our unity is obvious on the pitch we had to give a good image after the defeat in valencia we had to satisfy our fans
7595305 its great to start the season like this many of us including the coach were new last year and we didnt have a great start its important to begin the year with a title especially when you win like this
7595306 this has been a beautiful way to start the season and we just think about improving to do better in the league it was important to put pressure on valencia from the start and we managed to do that in the second half the groups dynamic is very good and the new players on the team have added much to our game we made it in the end
7595307 the fans support is very important to us i hope they support us this way throughout the season history is there to be rewritten and we hope to do that in riazor we are working on it and well do even better with this hype
7595308 these comebacks are only possible at the bernab u we played too far back in the first half and were too hasty in attack we made too many long passes
7595309 ironically both red cards played in our favour because they made us react we must nevertheless avoid these things from happening and try to play well from the start of each game
7595310 lately it seems like we grow more confident when we see we are one man down
7595311 we knew that the crowd would go wild if we scored after half time this is a very complicated venue for our opponents when that happens and we knew that
7595312 the first half was very comfortable for valencia we hardly played and found room to manouver nevertheless valencia didnt try any of the fast counterattacks they usually do their mistake was to believe they could win without running around much we knew the game would be harder for them if we scored one goal
7595313 i am very happy the spirit and unity on the squad gives us all a good feeling the bernab u always manages to help us win these games
7595314 the best of all things is that the team still has the great spirit it had two years ago nothing can spoil this
7595315 a proper team must have a winning mentality and we have that we overcame all adversity and always believed in our chances the second half was beautiful and exciting the final score was fair to the effort made by my players
7595316 this rarely happens i had never lived such an experience before neither as a player nor as a coach it was very surprising i relied on the opinion that some teams sometimes find it harder to play with one man more than their opponent the team unites more and works even harder when its one man down concentration also improves our opponent tonight didnt know how to play with their advantage and we benefitted from it
7595317 robinhos situation naturally isnt comfortable it was my decision not to use him tonight he is still on the team because we are waiting to see what happens and we hope he will finally stay with us this year
7595318 i had enough with thinking about what i was goiung to do than to think about what my opponent may have done we had to change the match but i guess losing like that must hurt valencia have a young and talented coach and i think they proved they will be an important team this year
7595319 this team has a very solid base that was hard to get we will keep an eye open in case some new signing can be made but it will be hard to improve on the quality of this squad
7595320 robinho is the same player he has always been he is important and should be a part of this project i think he knows he can make it big here we must resolve the situation as best as possible but we are all selfish and the best solution would really be for him to stay with us for many years
7595321 it definitively caused the problem yet reported no detectable errors weve taken steps to fortify our shipping system with the acquisition of additional equipment and worked with our vendors to verify were in good shape elsewhere
7595322 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
7595323 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
7595324 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
7595325 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but were charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
7595326 depending on the benchmarks you choose you might see massive speed up minor speed up or maybe even some slowdown those latter cases are definitely bugs and reporting them through bugzilla will be a big help
7595327 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
7595328 as the performance keeps going up people will write and transport code that was too slow to run in the browser as javascript this means the web can accommodate workloads that right now require a proprietary plugin

7595337 some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
7595338 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers
7595339 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what hhs secretary mike leavitt will do about it
7595340 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
7595341 if this is true this is an outrageous and unforgivable stunt cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
7595342 i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
7595343 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
7595344 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2007 goal of 5
7595345 exceeded only by a staggering lack of oversight by congress and by medicares own failure to protect the program against open thievery
7595346 cooking the books proves true heads should roll at cms
7595347 adequately fund investigations and after medical industry lobbyists complained about a new law requiring competitive bidding congress reneged on the deal
7595348 politicos lingering around washington can barely keep a straight face as they claim to be shocked
7595349 his ilk consistently claim that medicare is a model for government run universal health care because it spends less on overhead than the private sector
7595350 insurance companies spend money to screen their claims for fraud
7595351 medicare automatically pays more than 95 of the bills it receives
7595352 this lack of scrutiny reduces overhead but it makes the program highly vulnerable to abuse
7595353 the real reason liberals like mr stark are outraged is because they want to claim one of medicares vices as a virtue to help along their health care ambitions
7595354 shows that taxpayers will be literally poorer if stark gets his way
7595355 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status
7595356 such a program will cater for the very basic needs in form of information and education for seafarers when it comes to hiv aids
7595357 these people are very vulnerable as most information does not reach them due to their extended length of stay at sea
7595358 we have very high expectations for this program and will do everything possible to make sure that it succeeds if successful namibia could be used as a model for other countries facing the same scenario worldwide
7595359 it appears that significant comprehensive reform would not begin until september 2010

7595452 la tolleranza zero ha aggiunto il ministro va applicata fino in fondo
7595453 hanno detto che la loro intenzione era quella di violentare la donna non di rapinarli quasi come se lo stupro fosse una giustificazione
7595454 la cosa che pi mi ha colpito ha detto a cortina incontra che mi ha lasciato esterrefatto nelle dichiarazioni dei due che hanno confessato la violenza sessuale come se fosse una giustificazione una esimente rispetto alla rapina quasi come se nel loro modo di pensare fosse una cosa normale stuprare una persona agghiacciante
7595455 probabilmente ha proseguito pensano che in italia oggi chi commette un reato come la violenza carnale sia punito meno gravemente di chi fa una rapina
7595456 questo ha sottolineato un problema serio e grave non solo di ordine pubblico
7595457 abbiamo lavorato molto in questi tre mesi per garantire meglio la sicurezza anche a roma
7595458 alla faccia di chi ci accusa di essere razzisti o xenofobi
7595459 anche nei luoghi che sono stati teatro di aggressioni e violenza
7595460 sistemi di videosorveglianza per garantire la sicurezza nei luoghi pericolosi
7595461 al suo termine chi non ha il diritto di stare qua venga rispedito a casa
7595462 noi dobbiamo verificare chi ci sta e ha detto poi chi ha osservato la legge e ha il diritto di stare in italia deve poterlo fare con dignit e non nelle baracche in mezzo ai topi chi non ha il diritto di starci sar rispedito a casa

7595464 se i militari fossero stati impiegati dal governo prodi forse la signora reggiani a roma non sarebbe morta
7595465 dico che i militari servono ha spiegato maroni perch danno percezione di maggiore sicurezza e liberano forze dellordine che possono operare sul territorio
7595466 questa sia la strada giusta e non centra nulla la militarizzazione
7595467 il problema dei nostri critici ha osservato che non vogliono vedere n sentire nel decreto sicurezza vi sono norme efficaci come quella ideata da giovanni falcone sulla mafia che voleva distinguere la misura personale dal patrimonio se questultimo arriva da azioni criminali lo sequestro anche se intestato a un bambino
7595468 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7595469 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7595470 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7595471 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7595472 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7595473 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7595474 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7595475 you look at in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible

7595484 i dont think marc would be in the press the way he is if he didnt want to be
7595485 first of all last week we did not pressure well enough when i look at mario and im not trying to just say everything positive about mario but hes played hard and hes done everything weve asked him to do i have no problem with his performance but we need some production and pressure from other people and it just doesnt come up front its a combination of things up front we have to get better we have to put more pressure on the quarterback we have to win the one on ones because thats not fair to the back end in return if we bring a linebacker where we did last week we have to be able to slip a block and make a play on the quarterback not make the sack its not the sacks that concerns you its making the quarterbacks throw off rhythm go back and look at our offense against dallas last week how many sacks did dallas get zero but you know what they made that quarterback throw off rhythm and thats what we need to generate and along with that on the back end weve got to play some tighter coverage and make that quarterback have to hold that ball and trust me as coaches were not pleased with that performance last week and what did i do we went back and looked at every single play that we had in preseason with our starting unit to evaluate it is it something you called is it the way youre teaching it what area are we getting hurt in you know what i mean thats our job as coaches to fix it and its the players job also

7595535 some people claim that providing complete credit information encourages people to leave their job before a game is complete
7595536 these reasons are simple window dressing for policies that are arbitrary unfair and in some cases even vindictive and they simply dont hold up
7595537 all inclusive credits do a bit of a disservice as well to the people who are still part of the team who are still working on the game ill worry more about the people who are with me right now then those who decided that they didnt like the company or they wanted to take a better job

7595670 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7595671 you dont live in that neighborhood that is not your home
7595672 my colleagues in the national media are absolutely biased in the tank supporting the obama candidacy while claiming the mantle of objectivity
7595673 but it is actually making fun of people who believe the negative things about obama that are being circulated if you read the comments on reddit many of which are racist and stupid you realize that these people just dont get it
7595674 justin timberlake arrived in a separate car and met her inside he was saying how excited he was to be back in palm springs to see jessicas film
7595675 los estados avalamos estos acuerdos entre miembros de latinoam rica no son empresarios el alba que est n tratando de hacer negocios entre s sino que entre estados estamos tratando de satisfacer algunas demandas asoci ndolas a los dem s pa ses
7595676 uno de los beneficios m s importantes del alba son educaci n alfabetizaci n salud energ a y un proyecto social
7595677 levanten la mano quienes se oponen a que se alfabetice y eduque a los hondure os con apoyo de cuba y de venezuela

7595679 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7595680 basically we have set a standard in digital gaming the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative
7595681 bionic commando rearmed sells 130 000 units in a week
7595682 though i would love another mgs where would it even go
7595683 you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7595684 when i left the assembly assemblyman john burzichelli who i had gotten to know said dont feel bad because there are only two people that citizens know and remember the president of the united states and the mayor of their town
7595685 i dont have any relationship with her if theres still one loose end from all the things weve been able to accomplish after a difficult primary a year ago thats it shes made no attempt to approach me as the mayor
7595686 thats the responsibility of a legislator whether youre a freeholder assemblyman or legislator to stay in touch with the mayors of the municipalities of your district i talk to senator stack at least once a week here i am with a sitting assemblyperson in my own town and theres no communication
7595687 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7595688 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7595689 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7595690 a major factor has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
7595691 gelet op de populariteit van mijn boeken maak ik me geen zorgen
7595692 automation alone doesnt cut it with money as tight as it is it is extremely difficult to work in an environment that has no standards or where people dont adhere to standards its important to understand what is in place right now to build standard processes and related technology that are meaningful
7595693 im not aware of any incidents in which a concealed carry permit holder used a handgun in the commission of a crime
7595694 based on a quick review of reports submitted to us by the kansas department of health and environment it doesnt appear there has been an increase with regard to accidental shootings of children
7595695 i havent seen anything to suggest theres been any increase in the number of firearms deaths involving children
7595696 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7595697 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
7595698 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
7595699 rural america is really hurting so this is a real opportunity in washington and christine gregoires re election depends on this weve asked you to knock on twenty five doors three times
7595700 oregon is doing forty doors four times you can do forty doors in one weekend that is just four weekends
7595701 i doubt whether the world holds for anyone a more soul stirring surprise than the first adventure with ice cream
7595702 does not desire to pursue litigation against a defendant who in turn has professed such litigation has caused him mental trauma resulting in institutionalization and in assorted physical aliments
7595703 im extremely disappointed that they have dropped this suit i dont know what other solutions are available to me but this certainly does not settle who found it
7595704 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7595705 well i want to talk to you about my brother
7595706 hes really really sick and i want to buy a miracle
7595707 his name is andrew and he has something bad growing inside his head and my daddy says only a miracle can save him now so how much does a miracle cost
7595708 we dont sell miracles here little girl im sorry but i cant help you
7595709 listen i have the money to pay for it if it isnt enough i will get the rest just tell me how much it costs
7595710 and its all the money i have but i can get some more if i need to
7595711 a dollar and eleven cents the exact price of a miracle for little brothers
7595712 take me to where you live i want to see your brother and meet your parents lets see if i have the miracle you need
7595713 was a real miracle i wonder how much it would have cost
7595714 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7595715 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7595716 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7595717 its effortless to drive fast the brakes are really good for a stock car but im not sure about that transmission it was a little unpredictable
7595718 i brought my spec miata today you should take that out next
7595719 but there were three that were in really good shape and one was arizona thanks to pederson
7595720 in rural areas where folks havent voted for democrats in a while its because they havent seen democrats
7595721 its not im from the democratic party and i want you to vote for barack obama and delaware senator
7595722 i think the area where we spent the most attention was how to actually write the health care plank because clinton had proposed that it be an actual mandate to purchase health care and obama had not were all in agreement that there needs to be healthcare coverage for every man woman and child in the united states
7595723 there is no connection its as though whenever there is a by election the government cannot do anything everything must stop reduce fuel prices is also not permissible
7595724 just because the permatang pauh by election is taking place must we wait until it is over to announce a fuel price reduction must the people wait a few days a week to enjoy the lower prices
7595725 these stories are meant to attract the peoples attention true or not is another matter i also find this worrying
7595726 it is true in life we will come across all kinds of matters which can influence our thinking and feelings but we should not get carried away with issues like these as it can confuse us
7595727 we should not short change the future of our children
7595728 we are facing a real achievement gap in california and we must do something about
7595729 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7595730 the university of alabama which got great reviews from its students came in no 7 on our national public university ranking
7595731 although current penetration of the higher education market is only 2 3 that still represents a good rate of uptake for such a new pre standard technology
7595732 as video becomes an essential part of the academic experience bandwidth video requirements and newer laptops which increasingly will have 802 11n built in mean that a marriage of convenience will occur between students needs to view video anywhere on campus and the ability of 802 11n enabled laptops to handle the bandwidth requirements
7595733 in the indian context the most essential thing is to make such services affordable to a wider section of the public at a reasonable cost the next phase of expansion of mobile services was in the rural areas telecom policies should encourage service providers to push more and more into the interior of the country and develop business models for the rural service
7595734 it is placing the world on the threshold of a total transformation in communications
7595735 today accessing internet in india is as high as us 10 5 which has checked the internet penetration level to just 5 3 per cent inhabitants more internet users are being added every year on mobile than the cumulative wired base
7595736 already pc is aviliable in the range of rs15 20 000 and in the near future it is expected to come down further
7595737 i would like to be responsible for adding to his experience but this boy is self motivating
7595738 really the choice of joe biden in my opinion is tantamount to an admission barack obama himself lacks the necessary experience to be president
7595739 often patients think psoriasis is just a rash but it is a systemic inflammatory disease with far reaching affects
7595740 patients should be aware of that and understand that controlling that systemic inflammation can help with other diseases
7595741 it really has made life much more tolerable for patients
7595742 theyre similar to chemicals or compounds we already have in our system they help lessen immune responses they help soak up or diminish the extra inflammatory compounds
7595743 it is better to burn out then to fade away
7595744 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7595745 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
7595746 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
7595747 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
7595748 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
7595749 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
7595750 the voter list is questionable there are a lot unaccounted for
7595751 this is impossible this is a lie we dont have powers to remove the names under the constitution we dont have such powers it is impossible to have phantom voters
7595752 its particularly revealing that the obama campaign feels forced to cast flimsy attack ads during his own convention barack obamas politics of hope is waning
7595753 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7595754 i am not an expert on wall street i am not an expert on some of this stuff
7595755 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7595756 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7595757 big decisions of 2007 08 term addressed sentencing death penalty money laundering
7595758 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

7595768 there are many people in sa who are rich and who can share their riches with those who have not been able to conquer poverty
7595769 capitalism has been proved a false god because it leads inevitably to class war among rigidly defined classes socialism has been proved false because it has shown it cannot abolish these classes
7595770 the task is not to make the poor wealthy but productive
7595771 the wonder of modern institutions is not that they work so badly but that anything works at all
7595772 how can we be sure they have the capacity to manage funds in a responsible way

7595775 most people use newspaper but it has a layer that makes it non absorbent so our last instruction was to rub it to make it soft and absorbent that way it flushes through the system
7595776 when a bit of creative thought is applied it is simple to find a variety of ways to help but we have to bypass the inertia the solution is simply to start start with what can be done push the boundaries by doing what we can do well no matter how small it may be
7595777 there is an urgent need to mobilise people who can help and work out simple solutions for those who need them
7595778 the only way to achieve this is to get real commitment from government a commitment that is above politics and above party lines
7595779 the most necessary message of all and one that needs to go out to every single settlement every municipality and every person rich and poor is that certain things in life are beyond politics environmental and health rights are common to all of humanity
7595780 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7595781 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7595782 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7595783 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7595784 there is now a wealth of evidence that climate change has had and will have further impact on a variety of allergenic plants

7596115 etrip is the only company that offers the option of actually buying the tag outright if you buy a tag from us you will only pay 50c a month thereafter whereas if you decide not to buy it you will pay 1 per month whether you use it or not
7596116 an awful lot of people have no access to the internet so we decide that it would be easier to give the option of buying it outright from say tesco
7596117 people are afraid that they are being forced to top up by a huge amount we give guidelines recommending that you would put in something that would equate to an average monthly usage so if you are not a frequent user do not over pay
7596118 este um cargo de confian a e a pergunta sobre o meu futuro tem que ser feita ao presidente da confedera o brasileira de futebol ricardo teixeira falo com ele diariamente e vou seguir o trabalho como me foi pedido estou tranquilo n o h mudan a de planos
7596119 evitar que os clubes sads participantes nas competi es profissionais sejam prejudicados em virtude de tal facto
7596120 o nosso nico objectivo que ele continue a recuperar depois quando todas as fases da reabilita o estejam cumpridas veremos
7596121 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7596122 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7596123 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7596124 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7596125 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7596126 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7596127 parents usually dont understand their role in the course of their childs career development and cross the line between involvement and intervention
7596128 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7596129 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7596130 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7596131 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught
7596132 our studies have predicted a specific 3 dimensional shape displayed by a key protein that interacts with telomeres
7596133 this prediction has now provided us with a crucial tool that has propelled forward our studies of this protein
7596134 without est1 telomerase cannot get to the ends of chromosomes and thus telomeres shorten
7596135 the recent increase in the ability to predict protein structure is now permitting detailed analysis of many proteins including proteins like est3 whose function had been mysterious
7596136 this is surprising because tpp1 is not a subunit of the telomerase complex
7596137 what we now propose that this particular protein fold which both est3 and tpp1 exhibit is uniquely suited to the telomere
7596138 this is a line that i probably shouldnt use in washington but i will when i came to the dnc we fired all the washington consultants because we paid all of them a lot of money to tell us how to lose every four years
7596139 i dont know what the f cks going on im sorry
7596140 no veo posible la salida porque nadie ha preguntado por l
7596141 nosotros no vamos a negociar por l y a d a de hoy no veo a nadie en posici n de pagar la cl usula
7596142 theres a 20 percent gender gap already even before the convention she said
7596143 lets face it weve had different candidates in this race its disappointing win your candidate doesnt win
7596144 remember its not just about us and what our feelings are about the campaigns saying the goal has to be a november win for democrats
7596145 the wrestlers themselves had somehow decided to have a food fight in the dressing room
7596146 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7596147 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7596148 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7596149 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7596150 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7596151 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7596152 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7596153 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7596154 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7596155 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7596156 look at whats standing before you bill you think youre bigger than me you think youre smarter than me you think youre better than me
7596157 if you havent listened my friend im goldberg and dont you ever forget it
7596158 im not talking about you lose and go work for some second rate promotion like smackdown and walk through their wrestlers and become some kind of paper champion i mean you lose and you never step foot in the ring again
7596159 ill think hard on it but im not going to think long youre on
7596160 theres something between her ears that doesnt quite connect the dots
7596161 im not talking about just an ordinary man so i want you people to stand up and show your love for the worlds strongest man mark henry
7596162 the truth is eric bischoff is a very creative liar
7596163 you might be surprised at that but no more surprised than i am at you portraying yourself as a victim
7596164 there is only one victim in this world and youre looking at him its me its true i vincent kennedy mcmahon i am a victim
7596165 what came out of your demon infested womb im talking about our children shane and stephanie because of you they dont respect me youve turned my kids against me
7596166 i know how that feels now my family has all turned their backs on me because of you
7596167 because deep down in those sick twisted minds of yours youre both monsters
7596168 it may be wrong for a son to say to a father but you two can rot in hell
7596169 he is a genius and a billionaire and he commends respect and deserves respect
7596170 i did such a good job nobody noticed he was gone
7596171 at least you were on summerslam i am the intercontinental champion the peoples choice and stone cold steve austin kept me off that show
7596172 jesus christ you couldnt carry j r s jock strap
7596173 no i dont think im going to apologize to you
7596174 youre got a cowboy and a king what is this the village people
7596175 for the love of god tell me this isnt about to happen
7596176 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7596177 besides striker who was money again my ecw hat goes off to mark henry again this week
7596178 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
7596179 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
7596180 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7596181 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7596182 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7596183 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7596184 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
7596185 londen hoeft straks niet te doen wat peking moest doen
7596186 ha sido una buena despedida estoy muy orgulloso de estos a os y ahora es el momento de que entre gente nueva
7596187 hace dos a os los ve a por la tele y era un sue o ahora sigue siendo un sue o pero si les tengo que hacer una falta se la hago a partir de ahora igual que yo ve a por televisi n los m ticos partidos de jordan y dem s ahora ser este partido el que se vea

7596190 finally people are interested in what ive been trying to explain to them for the past 27 years
7596191 ever since i was little my parents knew there was something a bit different about me and growing up in the states they didnt exactly know where to put me because i wasnt autistic i didnt have cerebral palsy i was failing every subject and teachers were bullying me other students
7596192 something as simplistic as getting dressed in the morning was quite difficult so id show up to class late
7596193 and i remember when i was seven i put my jeans on in the wrong direction inside out
7596194 imagine having problems with depth perception and trying to do geometry or lining up numbers
7596195 i cant judge which way the arrows should go and which way it should go in
7596196 these are not children who are just low in athletic ability
7596197 they are children who are having difficulty with everyday activities like buttering bread turning a key in the lock printing cutting combing their hair just doing everyday activities
7596198 its helpful to families when they recognize that their children are struggling to know that the children are not going to get worse that its not a degenerative condition
7596199 in fact the children are going to develop some skills over time and therefore they will seem better
7596200 if people realize how hard it is for them to do the motor aspect of tasks and they understand it theres lots of ways around many tasks
7596201 nothings missing with us we have talents things are just a bit off
7596202 acabamos de comenzar y la imagen del equipo y las sensaciones son buenas y hay que mantenerlas hay que buscar un buen resultado no s lo para asegurar la clasificaci n sino para continuar con el buen nivel demostrado hasta ahora
7596203 si fichamos a alguien ser un jugador de banda izquierda y del que tendremos que estar totalmente convencidos
7596204 ju nikt nigdy przez tego pana ycia pozbawiony nie b dzie
7596205 we schudden alle last uit het verleden van onze schouders bij een club radiodieren dat trots mag zijn op wat ze tot op heden heeft bereikt en dat ons met open armen heeft willen begroeten

7596207 were working together early in the morning so thats kind of sad im going to be there right when shes turning 21
7596208 i think barack needed some of that scar tissue some of that toughening up that senator clinton gave him
7596209 i hope whoever you supported in the primary you will unite behind our candidate and know that you have my thanks and baracks thanks
7596210 we love her we think shes terrific but it is time for all of us to come together and unite and get behind barack obama
7596211 the democratic party is going to come out of this convention extremely united
7596212 it doesnt take much to spark the enthusiasm of the people on both sides
7596213 people are through with that argument and want to move on
7596214 i believe that we are united for a common purpose

7596221 i believe that we are united for a common purpose
7596222 no matter how paranoid or conspiracy minded you are what the government is actually doing is worse than you imagine
7596223 this is a very real tragedy and our condolences go the family of claire we are continuing to find out how claire came to be in the water that night and would repeat my appeal for anyone who may have seen claire near to the sea wall near to the metropole to come forward

7596225 she hasnt cried once except for a second when they pulled her out
7596226 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7596227 un conjunto de fallos que est n por determinar por parte de la comisi n de investigaci n
7596228 no se le han hecho m s inspecciones que a otra compa a a rea espa ola y no se han detectado en ning n caso alg n tipo de problema que afecte a la seguridad

7596237 never admitted the full extent to which he cooperated with his captors
7596238 he took away the only leverage we had for getting those soldiers back why he was paying back the vietnamese for keeping quiet about him
7596239 one of the most despicable people i have ever had the misfortune to encounter
7596240 allows the media to make him out to be the hero pow which he knows is absolutely not true
7596241 blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his 15 minutes of fame
7596242 hoy debemos consumar lo que creo es nuestra misi n hist rica defender a los pa ses peque os de los agresores

7596245 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7596246 lost airspeed and entered a wooded area west of the lake
7596247 if china wants to further its interactions with the west its going to have to embrace some degree of political liberalization

7596253 from top to bottom proposition 4 is the most deceptive measure on the california ballot this fall it might look like yet another well meaning but misguided effort the third in four years to force minors to notify their parents before seeking an abortion but this years version is more insidious voters should run to the polls in november to reject it
7596254 should i sit here and reply by mentioning to you about a european christian who raped her own daughter i do not think that you are not aware on what has happened few months ago in austria these things are common in the west
7596255 if any of your women are guilty of lewdness take the evidence of four reliable witness from amongst you against them if they testify confine them to houses until death do claim them or god ordain for them some other way
7596256 its not as important for people to fall in love with the product as it is for them to know that browser security is becoming increasingly important with more than a third of attacks coming via the internet
7596257 i think what separates us though is that were a lot more paranoid if you will at the security level and i think this product will reflect that
7596258 ie is a trusted application and therefore a very common vector but because parts of its code are built into the os once you hack into ie you can do anything you want

7596273 ya ampiiiuunnnn darimana saja kamu kawan baru tiga bulan kita berpisah koq kamu udah lusuh banget kumal kotor lecet dan bau padahal waktu kita sama sama keluar dari peruri kita sama sama keren kan ada dapa denganmu
7596274 ya beginilah nasibku kawan sejak kita keluar dari peruri hanya tiga hari saya berada di dompet yang bersih dan bagus
7596275 wah sedih sekali perjalananmu kawan berbeda sekali dengan pengalamanku kalau aku ya sejak kita keluar dari peruri itu aku disimpan di dompet kulit yang bagus dan harum setelah itu aku pindah ke dompet seorang wanita cantik hmmm dompetnya harum sekali setelah dari sana aku lalu berpindah pindah kadang kadang aku ada di hotel berbintang 5 masuk ke restoran mewah ke showroom mobil mewah di tempat arisan ibu ibu pejabat dan di tas selebritis pokoknya aku selalu berada di tempat yang bagus jarang deh aku di tempat yang kamu ceritakan itu dan aku jarang lho ketemu sama teman temanmu
7596276 ya nasib kita memang berbeda kamu selalu berada di tempat yang nyaman tapi ada satu hal yang selalu membuat saya senang dan bangga daripada kamu
7596277 aku sering bertemu teman temanku di kantong kantong kolekte di gereja dan di kotak kotak amal di mesjid atau di tempat tempat lain hampir setiap minggu aku mampir di tempat tempat itu jarang banget tuh aku melihat kamu disana
7596278 my wife is pregnant and i dont let my wife drink the water
7596279 there is the potential for an increased risk for those people who are prone to estrogenic cancer
7596280 the timing makes the poison as much as the dose
7596281 and the dose itself is not the dose from just any one thing
7596282 they miss some of the big issues our research shows mixtures are so prevalent
7596283 if there are any cumulative or additive issues you cant just dismiss things so quickly
7596284 we recognize it is a growing concern and were taking it very seriously
7596285 new york citys drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system
7596286 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7596287 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7596288 based on what we now know i would say we find theres little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health
7596289 theres no doubt about it pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds in the small concentrations that theyre at could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms
7596290 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7596291 it could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something we havent gotten far enough along
7596292 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7596293 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7596294 we realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations
7596295 were going to be able to learn a lot more
7596296 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7596297 we know we are being exposed to other peoples drugs through our drinking water and that cant be good
7596298 considerando que en la actualidad bolivia se encuentra virtualmente dividida en dos visiones de pa s completamente opuestas una de car cter socialista katarista y otra democr tica y de libre mercado sin posibilidades de convivir y que se pelean todos los d as desde hace mucho tiempo que este clima de conflicto da a a toda la naci n haciendo temer una guerra civil de funestas consecuencias para toda la poblaci n boliviana y en especial para los m s despose dos que hay pa ses en el mundo que al encontrarse con dos proyectos fatalmente enfrentados con soluciones pol ticas que no pod an ser armonizadas optaron por crear dos estados como por ejemplo corea del norte y corea del sur con reg menes distintos e ideolog as diferentes subrayando que corea no desapareci sino que existen dos coreas que la llamada media luna es un territorio riqu simo no s lo por el gas y el petr leo que tiene sino tambi n por otros recursos naturales que permitir an a esa inmensa regi n lograr un desarrollo mayor que redundar a en beneficio de sus pobladores mientras que el occidente tambi n es muy rico no s lo en minerales pues cuenta con inmensas zonas aptas para la agricultura y la ganader a que no vale la pena hacernos matar por algunos dirigentes de una u otra regi n pues cada una de stas tendr a su l der propio y sus propias leyes decreta a partir del 14 de septiembre fiesta de cochabamba se crean dos bolivias en vez de una la bolivia occidental y la bolivia oriental la east bolivia y la west bolivia quedando cochabamba como la capital de ambas o el distrito federal donde residir el supergobierno que controlar a los gobiernos de las dos bolivias es dado en el bar comercio de la ciudad de cochabamba y promulgado en el palacio del sillpanchu firmas ilegibles y sellos etc

7596300 the man was armed with a gun and holding a woman against her will
7596301 as the officers were attempting to calm the man shots were fired
7596302 hes been a highly regarded employee of our police department for about four years
7596303 the end of the republican party as they know it
7596304 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7596305 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7596306 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7596307 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7596308 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7596309 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7596310 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7596311 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7596312 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7596313 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7596314 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7596315 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7596316 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7596317 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7596318 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7596319 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7596320 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7596321 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7596322 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7596323 r i p maurice foxx mashpee wampanoag first nations activist
7596324 time for a pay revolt leaflet and poster to print out to build the workshop
7596325 wow your daughter is gorgeous she looks just like you
7596326 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7596327 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7596328 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7596329 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7596330 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7596331 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7596332 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7596333 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7596334 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7596335 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7596336 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7596337 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7596338 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7596339 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7596340 and big ant has in his backyard three guinea pigs a couple of rabbits birds cats and fish everywhere but just because a person has tattoos they wouldnt come running with us
7596341 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7596342 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7596343 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7596344 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7596345 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7596346 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7596347 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7596348 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7596349 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7596350 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7596351 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7596352 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7596353 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7596354 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7596355 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7596356 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7596357 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7596358 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7596359 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7596360 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7596361 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7596362 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7596363 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7596364 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7596365 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7596366 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7596367 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7596368 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7596369 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7596370 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7596371 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7596372 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7596373 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7596374 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7596375 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7596376 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7596377 its so easy to find information about the book and so easy to find other people who are talking about the book
7596378 kids may not be spending as much time reading a novel but theyre spending a lot more time reading things online
7596379 the chapters come out at a certain time and so everyone is reading at the same pace and knows whats going on at the same time
7596380 you get sort of like the suspense of a movie

7596384 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

7596388 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7596389 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7596390 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7596391 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7596392 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7596393 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7596394 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7596395 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7596396 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7596397 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7596398 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7596399 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7596400 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7596401 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
7596402 some people do not appreciate that the very ethos of being indian is to accept different streams of thought faith caste and language
7596403 we should collectively ensure that any effort to create disharmony in society is not permitted let us collectively protect our social and communal harmony and isolate those who threaten it
7596404 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
7596405 what weve found is the customer behavior patterns have changed and customer tastes and preferences are much more aligned with the justice concept now
7596406 i think theyre refining another niche because people are spending a lot less money on clothes

7596417 i have had some e mails from christians who perhaps have not grasped the evangelizing spirit of the initiative or the potential of the internet which is a marvelous tool for spreading the christian message
7596418 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7596419 i cant believe in a god who would allow suffering

7596443 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7596444 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7596445 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7596446 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7596447 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7596448 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7596449 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7596450 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7596451 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun

7596453 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7596454 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7596455 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7596456 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7596457 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7596458 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7596459 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7596460 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7596461 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7596462 tsmc sat on the sidelines for several years but now appears convinced that mems is ready for prime time with consumer electronics and mobile applications
7596463 following iphones lead which put motion sensing to the core of the stunning display we expect to see mems mobile phones rapidly expand as manufacturers scramble to differentiate with similar functions
7596464 sensing and controlling technologies are the backbone of our businesses
7596465 we expect mems can further fortify those strengths of ours

7596470 i think people enjoy seeing if it the mod can be done
7596471 and when it is done it reminds them of their favourite old consoles from back in the day and has a nostalgia factor
7596472 several years ago i wanted to get into a new hobby since the old one independent filmmaking was tiring me i decided to see what i could hack up using an old atari 2600 gaming system i managed to make a portable version of it and did a web page describing the process requests came pouring in and ive been doing mods ever since
7596473 most people want their technology to look like technology but there are always those who are drawn to a more nostalgic sense of style
7596474 people want to have things worth keeping there isnt much manufactured today that will stand the test of time
7596475 theres the problem of last weeks technology looking embarrassingly out of date and the pointless expense of upgrading things that dont need upgrading
7596476 on the other hand make a keyboard look a century out of date at the get go and in 10 years that steampunk keyboard is just going to look better for some authentic wear

7596480 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7596481 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis

7596490 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7596491 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients
7596492 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
7596493 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission

7596496 se trata de hablar de la memoria desde un espacio que tiene memoria propia
7596497 elegir un espacio en ruinas o deteriorado es un reflejo de la mutaci n que sufre la memoria
7596498 el recuerdo se simplifica hasta lo m nimo y a veces lo unes a la fantas a con lo que recuerdas a veces algo mutado que no es real deteriorado se convierte en eso en deterioro decadencia en mutaci n de lo que pudo ser y en lo que ha llegado a convertirse

7596501 la verdad es que hace tres a os que no voy al partido en el 2005 me aleje de la actividad partidaria
7596502 no es un tema que me est preocupando en este momento
7596503 no veo mucho movimiento no s qu suceder esta noche en la reuni n del partido pero yo no voy a concurrir
7596504 no veo mucho entusiasmo por lo partidario los partidos pol ticos est n tan desacreditados que no despiertan entusiasmo la gente no quiere saber nada de lo partidario
7596505 lo que hay que hacer es trabajar para el 2009 para las elecciones legislativas
7596506 either she says it that way or she shouldnt speak at all
7596507 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7596508 i will be telling my delegates that i will vote for barack obama
7596509 how they vote is a more personal decision they want to have their chance to vote for me that is what traditionally happens some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling them both ways
7596510 er zijn nog altijd grote afschrijvingen en terwijl de markten opdrogen zullen de banken nog grotere problemen ervaren om activiteiten te verkopen

7596515 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7596516 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7596517 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7596518 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7596519 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7596520 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7596521 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7596522 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7596523 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7596524 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7596525 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7596526 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7596527 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7596528 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7596529 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7596530 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7596531 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7596532 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7596533 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7596534 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7596535 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7596536 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7596537 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7596538 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7596539 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7596540 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7596541 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7596542 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7596543 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7596544 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7596545 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7596546 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7596547 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so

7596575 we cannot get away from empowering people because they have to make so many decisions
7596576 finding that the current programs dont work does not mean we shouldnt do it

7596589 vitamin d and health in the 21st century an update
7596590 given recent findings its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making broad public health recommendations
7596591 this is a very complex set of issues and there is still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations
7596592 its tempting to think that an essential nutrient is safe at any level that if some is good more is better

7596641 on the other hand short stories and dramas never took me anywhere in that direction
7596642 i dont think i ever became a writer i do not see it as something that i accomplished in my life but more as something i wasnt able and never wanted to escape from i hope ill never stop writing because i would be incomplete without it but i also think that i will never regard my self a writer by trade and destiny

7597028 evolution will continue to be relevant to numerous domains of human endeavor and well worth celebrating as one of the most influential ideas in the history of human efforts to understand the world and our place in it
7597029 is that he provided an explanation for the fossil record one that is elegant in its simplicity
7597030 ive always felt an academic closeness with darwin darwins exploration of south america on the beagle was critical for his idea of evolution through natural selection he too collected fossil mammals there
7597031 some of the strange animals found in south america in fact helped him realize that entire groups of animals once lived in south america but had gone extinct an observation that pushed him toward evolution through natural selection and away from the world of immutable species
7597032 the extensive press coverage of the controversies relating to the teaching of evolution tended to obscure the fact that there is effectively no controversy within biology or biomedical science as to whether evolution occurs
7597033 in fact evolution via natural selection at a minimum relies on a two step process generation of genetic differences that cause variation in traits that can be inherited and differential reproductive success as a function of that diversity in traits while the production of variation in genes and in the traits influenced by those genes involves a random element selection is distinctly non random in fact non randomness is the very essence of natural selection

7597050 the psychological pressures of the security situation that we used to have in diyala the systematic killing especially in some parts of baquba where the governments forces presence was weak allowed the insurgents to use religion to exploit women

7597066 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7597067 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7597068 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7597069 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7597070 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7597071 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7597072 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7597073 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7597074 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7597075 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

7597083 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7597084 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
7597085 so its kind of like it wraps as it rotates
7597086 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
7597087 its kind of like a very very bad day for earth
7597088 scientists say if it did impact the earth it would carry the force of 110 000 hiroshima bombs
7597089 at that time well probably be able to refine its orbit and determine how likely it is to hit the earth
7597090 if this one were to hit the earth you could say that most of life would be extinguished
7597091 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7597092 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7597093 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7597094 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7597095 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7597096 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7597097 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7597098 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7597099 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7597100 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7597101 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7597102 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7597103 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7597104 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7597105 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7597106 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7597107 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7597108 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7597109 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7597110 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7597111 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7597112 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7597113 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7597114 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7597115 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7597116 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7597117 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7597118 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7597119 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7597120 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7597121 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7597122 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7597123 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7597124 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7597125 who are open to doing something on the production side
7597126 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7597127 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7597128 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7597129 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7597130 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7597131 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7597132 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7597133 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7597134 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7597135 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7597136 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7597137 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7597138 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7597139 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7597140 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7597141 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7597142 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7597143 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7597144 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7597145 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7597146 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7597147 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7597148 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7597149 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7597150 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7597151 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7597152 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7597153 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7597154 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7597155 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7597156 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7597157 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7597158 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7597159 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7597160 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7597161 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7597162 still holding out and undecided about voting for barack obama
7597163 anyone whos thinking about voting for mccain because youre upset your candidate didnt get the nomination shame on you
7597164 youre thinking about not voting at all because your candidate didnt get the nomination shame on you again

7597176 until now solar power has been a daytime only energy source because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient with todays announcement mit researchers have hit upon a simple inexpensive highly efficient process for storing solar energy
7597177 an ingenious device inspired by growing plant root tips is opening up a new type of hydraulic fluid power hydraulic actuators which are powered by osmosis and inspired by growing plant root tips are able to deliver very large forces at low power because they act very slowly they could never replace conventional hydraulic applications such as earth moving equipment but potential applications include an alternative way to break up rocks or concrete offering potential in the mining or construction industries and as a way of keeping steel ropes in tension such as on a suspension bridge

7597181 they will protect us against the kind of earthquake that would leave no skyscraper in frankfurt standing
7597182 the people and the politicians have been asking us what we would do with the additional profits
7597183 what we are now saying is we are going to give you some of it back
7597184 the idea is so clever because the only thing the producers are missing right now is overwhelming public support
7597185 if they can persuade the people that they will get a tangible by which i mean monetary benefit from letting the plants run longer they have won
7597186 the factors that conditioned the 2002 decision have changed radically in the past few years whether we are talking about capacity estimates for conventional power oil prices power prices or the governments new co 2 emission goals
7597187 save co 2 emissions equivalent to the emissions produced by road transport in the whole of germany and they do so at a very low cost from an energy policy point of view and given the need to keep power prices in check a reversal of the phase out is necessary
7597188 in theory you can pull out of nuclear and achieve your emissions goals
7597189 but this will require massive efforts in other areas such as mobility which will be very costly
7597190 we do not have a fully workable alternative wind power is great but it fluctuates too much to replace the stable supply of nuclear there are interesting ideas about how to store wind power but we need time to develop them time we do not have if we switch off our nuclear plants
7597191 the phase out provides a powerful incentive for the deployment of renewable energy and the improvement of efficiency that would otherwise not be there
7597192 the construction speed of conventional power plants and transmission lines is much slower than expected
7597193 one crucial reason is the increasing resistance in local communities to coal fired power plants we just had a plan for a twin 800mw coal plant in saarland falling through because of political opposition
7597194 i see the lack of acceptance for new plants whether nuclear or not as the single biggest argument in favour of letting nuclear plants run longer
7597195 if we do not i fear the dena scenario is precisely what will happen
7597196 perhaps it is because we have lived with the plant for the past 30 years but here it is not such a big deal
7597197 everyone knows someone who works there many people have visited the plant and seen for themselves how much is being invested in its safety i would not trade it for a coal powered plant for anything in the world
7597198 my worry is that at some point people will say enough
7597199 we had to try it because it was the only approach we had but were in virgin territory
7597200 now all bets are off and we have to put aside all historical lessons based on classical vaccinology
7597201 vaccines are about science but microbicides are about engin eering its about getting the right drug to the right place at the right time
7597202 we have to plan more with greater preparation going into pharmacology toxicology and trial design

7597204 we have to prepare the public for what the pharma industry already knows most of these trials fail but we have to stay the course

7597223 the suspicion is that banks are still hiding losses the banking system relies on trust and at the minute there quite simply isnt any
7597224 the trade to do in december will be to get back into the most liquid thing you can find
7597225 we are having a period now of a second round of pressures on banks its weak economic growth which is now piling the pain onto the banks
7597226 the credit crunch remains the centerpiece of our bond strategy
7597227 the problem is much more systemic than was widely anticipated a year ago
7597228 not only bank balance sheets but home balance sheets are under pressure due to falling house prices
7597229 libor markets arent reflective of the entire banking system but of three or four major banks that continue to have pressure on liquidity
7597230 that spreads to the entire system because you are not really sure who you are going to end up lending to through the libor market
7597231 not over and im not exactly sure when its going to end
7597232 it was clear from what was said that most people here dont believe the financial crisis is necessarily over or close to being over
7597233 there were continuing concerns about housing and how much further those prices have to fall
7597234 there is some fear that something else may happen in the system
7597235 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7597236 to listen better and filter warnings better in the future
7597237 nouriel was only off actually by a year and a half or so
7597238 were not even looking at anything very serious relative to recessions of the past
7597239 after listening to you i feel like a need a drink or a hug or something i joked to him afterward roubini gets a lot of such quips and as his direst predictions about a once in a lifetime bust in the us economy come ever closer to reality i find myself hoping hell be proven wrong
7597240 one year later in the us the lack of improvement in the money markets is still taking center stage
7597241 the global credit crisis has exacerbated home grown liquidity squeezes in countries like south korea
7597242 youve had the popular names and free shares falling which has added up to a torrid year for private shareholders
7597243 private shareholders tend to be buy and hold investors whereas the big institutions have been dumping shares and short selling which has driven share prices down further
7597244 far too often private investors are derided for simply following market trends time and again our research shows this isnt true
7597245 within a few weeks as opposed to a few months
7597246 at the margins there can still be cases where you see dangers of gaming the system
7597247 we are satisfied with our framework but since there are always on the margins evolutions we have to adjust our framework regularly to market practices
7597248 the lender of last resort should be just that a last resort and not a permanent provider of funds to the private sector
7597249 it has been suspected for some time that banks could be taking advantage of the broad collateral framework since they no longer publicly place asset backed securities and these securities now only serve as collateral in central bank funding
7597250 this means that a necessary market correction in the abs segment is being put off
7597251 our framework is complex and if we can warn people that this is not acceptable beforehand and they adjust in due time we would be satisfied
7597252 would not necessarily be a question to be discussed publicly
7597253 the question is whether the slowdown will last a little bit longer
7597254 you shouldnt be getting too hung up about the volatility in quarter to quarter gdp readings
7597255 substantial risk that price pressures will persist the ecb will publish revised projections next month
7597256 its simply not clear at least not clear to me what will stop this self reinforcing process
7597257 the primary focus to date has been on the provision of liquidity
7597258 the measures that affect capital either by supporting asset values injecting public funds or strengthening economic performance are increasingly important for the future
7597259 theyve already gone too far to the edge of the cliff
7597260 some form of intervention is going to be very difficult to avoid
7597261 there arent easy options from here but the one that supports the mortgage market is going to override
7597262 the crisis has now spread to the real economy and who knows what will happen as a result
7597263 we are just at an early stage of privatisation and we are weak at investment banking by international standards in the long term we should strengthen that weakness
7597264 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers
7597265 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7597266 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals
7597267 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates
7597268 i think this may well be the defining event in mr paulsons tenure
7597269 if youve got a squirt gun in your pocket you probably will have to take it out if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know it you probably wont have to take it out
7597270 on the other hand if the companies scrape by and no government money is needed the operation will likely be viewed as a success in the short run but a crucial missed opportunity in the long run
7597271 he recommended i invest the money in student loan auction rate securities
7597272 like everybody else on february 14 the day the auction rate securities market froze i was caught and could not liquidate it made me feel like the whole world was coming to an end
7597273 im 100pc certain that if andrew cuomo didnt straighten them out id still be waiting for my money
7597274 since the breakdown in the ars market ubs clients have been offered multiple liquidity options including the ability to borrow 100pc against the par value of their ars holdings
7597275 i will never let any investment bankers handle my money again
7597276 i am lucky this time i am not sure i will be again
7597277 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7597278 any real improvement is still a long way off price to keep falling
7597279 this acquisition will contribute to limiting the negative effect on denmarks financial system
7597280 potential buyers have expressed severe uncertainty as to the general credit culture of the bank
7597281 we had preferred that a private buyer had been found but in the current serious situation this solution is necessary
7597282 fewer people are willing to buy property which contributes to a decline in housing prices and that leads to more foreclosures and higher losses which hurts fannie mae and freddie mac which pull back by tightening their mortgage terms thus continuing the cycle
7597283 many of us had already described as the worst in a generation took a turn for the worse after the quarter ended
7597284 the motivation for the bailout was to prevent that type of spiral
7597285 their ability to lend is constrained by their insufficient capital higher spreads and investor doubts about whether they will be allowed to continue to operate in a business as usual mode
7597286 at the top of a bull market everything is always limited
7597287 they cant find out the stuff they want to find out and theyve got so much to do because there have been so many cuts
7597288 you no longer have that favored guy who gets the wink and the nod before everyone else
7597289 unless youve got an analyst with a really good handle on an industry it just gets tougher and tougher in an environment like this
7597290 often an individual analyst knows the company better than we do because they follow it on a daily basis
7597291 good analysts will bring a company to our attention thats not getting a lot of attention on wall street
7597292 its not the high profit high dollar profession that it used to be
7597293 in the wake of all the regulation to separate investment banking from analysis the job of the analyst became just that often just watching the stocks and checking the estimates
7597294 youve got to do lots of other things beside read an analyst report and take an earnings estimate at face value
7597295 releasing even a portion of this carbon into the atmosphere in the form of methane or carbon dioxide would have an significant impact on earths climate

7597312 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7597321 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7597322 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7597351 por lo que le pas a lafita desgraciadamente se abri una oportunidad para m y la estoy afrontando con la ilusi n de ganarme la titularidad poco a poco todos somos conscientes de que la competencia est m s fuerte este a o que el pasado y nadie se quiere quedar fuera
7597352 desde m punto de vista aqu no hay once mejores todos tenemos calidad es una plantilla muy buena y no se puede hablar de un s lo once
7597353 nos jugamos mucho en estos dos partidos igual no tanto en el de liga porque es el inicio y todav a faltar a mucho pero s por el rival al que nos enfrentamos de todas formas estamos pensando en el jueves en el pase a la uefa todos estamos muy ilusionados y queremos seguir con ese sue o europeo del que tanto hablamos
7597354 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o de mayor importancia es el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos porque estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejarlo escapar despu s de lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto
7597355 todos los que venimos de otro equipo de otro pa s al f tbol europeo so amos con jugar un d a la uefa la liga de campeones y poco a poco vamos cumpliendo objetivos en mi segundo a o aqu estoy a un pasito de jugar en europa y todos sabemos la importancia de este tipo de torneos te dan madurez y te proyectan
7597356 escuchaba que hab a mucho pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera muy diferente sabemos que el gol visitante cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general fuera de casa hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar
7597357 ellos van a estar m s presionados ahora que juegan en casa y nosotros no tenemos nada que perder ojal pueda darse un partido bueno para nosotros con m s espacios habr que aprovecharlos
7597358 no es nada nuevo ni sorprendente que un equipo como el real madrid haya sacado adelante un partido como el de la supercopa porque tiene grandes figuras somos conscientes del equipo al que nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor
7597359 jugaremos con mucha motivaci n porque queremos seguir manteniendo la racha de invictos ante el real madrid que es de muchos a os se habla ya de una tradici n

7597365 cell phones prada us weekly and have a mindless herd mentality then by all means this is the place for you
7597366 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7597367 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7597368 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7597369 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7597370 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7597375 it is an abuse for ministers to wait until the dail is on holidays and the country is on holidays to introduce huge increases without notice it is an attempt by ministers to hide the increases
7597376 there are too many regulations and revenue increases being brought forward by ministers in this way that by pass the dail
7597377 johhny johhny johhny you lost the dating argument fair and square on the science alone
7597378 we as a whole cannot date anything accurately you know it i know it other scientist know it they refuse to admit it because lord forbid if any of them are ever wrong
7597379 you lost you cant even date an eruption that we can prove in history happened
7597380 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7597381 ill let mary schweitzer speak for herself and allow the people to decide flesh and blood from a 65 million year old dinosaur dragon thats still funny but you have to ask yourself why this isnt paraded around like their mighty date testing crap could be the people would see the man behind the curtain
7597382 if you cant trust the first words of the bible gen 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
7597383 oh come on you guys believe all life sprang up from a rock a rock that is faith for ya what a maroon
7597384 they recently dated the new dome on top the volcano want to know how old the tests say 340 000 to 2 8 million years not only is that wrong but look at that margin not only is the error off by a multiple of 100 000 28 years 2 800 000 years but the gap between the readings is nearly 2 5 million years but that is a small camel to swallow for the camel swallowing long earth agers it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that the radiometric indicators used by evolutionists to get their great ages of the earth can be off by as much as a factor of 1 billion due to a billion fold acceleration of beta decay add to that the known errors in radiocarbon dating and you have an earth age that is dead center on the 6000 year age indicated by the genealogies in genesis and subsequent recorded histories in the tanakh so a 100 000 fold error is a small pill to swallow for these religious evolutionist nuts who have already swallowed a camel they have always gone on blind faith without any genuine bona fide evidence to support it
7597385 johnny has been as lost as a frog in a hailstorm from the very beginning of this discussion
7597386 and who made you the creator of the english language
7597387 dude that whole argument smells fishy or at least squiddy they would have found them earlier if the would have gotten over their over blown egos see example above the reason no real effort to find one was scientists evos probably a few emoss as well said they couldnt possibly exist oh the high and mighty have spoken wow on there first real expedition having finally securing funds lo and behold what do they find a real live monster giant squid johnny come down off your highchair your flinging food all over and well since you think your part monkey your bound to start flinging something else whoops to late japanese fishing boats keep hauling up dinosaur carcasses
7597388 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7597389 ahh johhny so full of arogance heres what god says about people like you rom 1 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
7597390 theres no such thing as a giant squid they cant possibly exist theres no dinosaurs dragons they all died out millions of years ago everybody knows theres global warming why because we say so
7597391 ignore aks arguments havent ignored any theres just no challenge to them he apparently ran out of evo proof and had to attack the bible i think his head burst after the massive amount of replys that came in god will always call some one to defend his word i wont respond to the last comment i dont swing that way johhny
7597392 case in point coelacanth fish the great and mighty transitional fossil
7597393 heres a prediction for ya romans 1 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse 21 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen 26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 30 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 31 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful 32 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
7597394 what a maroon that has already been done except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment the testing lab was not told in advance where the rock came from so they could not fake the results to agree with how old they thought the rock was choke on it
7597395 except in this case it was a truly scientific experiment
7597396 johnny johnny johnny the fossils for the coelacanth are 140 million years old whenfisrt discovered it was proclaimed a missing link that is until they were found alive 140 million years and 0 change thats a big0 nothing no evolutionary advancement what so ever you cant get over that you cant explain that away the only way you can is if the fossils werent found in 140 million year old dirt give it a rest already you failed
7597397 thats industry wide your mad your millions of years have sunk to the bottom there was no deceite in the test like i said call the company and complain a test is a test is a test why what would have happened if they told them where it was from shouldnt the results be the same are you saying theres 2 standards of testing johnny is there improbriaty in the lab
7597398 samples less than 5 m y old or containing less than 0 1 k will incur a 50 surcharge reflecting the special care and additional analysis required we cannot analyze samples expected to be younger than 2 m y
7597399 john they were told the sample should have low argon they tested it and came back with an answer apparently their was argon in the rock this invalidates the whole k ar testing as a whole probaly why they dont mention this on their website this testing was there bread and butter its what they started out doing again all of your tests only work if you dont know the date again you fail maybe well look at other dating tests again
7597400 that is just too funny but i guess the humor in it is entirely lost on you
7597401 police are investigating the woman most probably was not a nun
7597402 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7597403 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7597404 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7597405 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7597406 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7597407 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7597408 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7597409 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7597410 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7597411 uncle as democrats gather in denver mccain works to undermine their unity
7597412 by ignoring the tragedy in maille for so long by remaining indifferent to the pain of the survivors by letting the memory of the victims be erased france committed a moral mistake
7597413 michelle wrote her own stump speech and you know shes refining it now i think as were going into the general election
7597414 we have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver so shes really working on it as we speak
7597415 some people will see confidence and others might see cockiness i think some people will see strength others might see arrogance
7597416 she comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with
7597417 one comment made off hand might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition
7597418 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country

7597613 our customers are telling us i want volvo to give me the most fuel efficient truck possible we need every bit of help we can get to survive the escalation in diesel prices
7597614 but we realized we can give them far more than the truck fuelwatch is our way to bring volvos deep knowledge of fuel economy to customers in a way that delivers these benefits throughout the entire life and operation of their trucks using less fuel is good for customers and its also good for the environment
7597615 fuelwatch allows customers to take the best specifications and use them most efficiently and most productively to drive success
7597616 we know from our experience however that even the best and maintained truck can deliver poor fuel economy if the driver lacks the knowledge and training to use it efficiently the driver has the biggest impact good or bad on fuel economy
7597617 we think the days of inexpensive fuel are over and the trucking industry must adapt to this new reality
7597618 fuelwatch is not a switch that fleets can throw or a part they can bolt on a truck this is a partnership between volvo our customers and our dealers involving a comprehensive approach to improving fuel economy tailored to the individual customer were confident the fuelwatch process will play an important role in their success

7597637 we can not hope for happier results either for religion or for the civil government from the wishes of those who desire that the church be separated from the state and the concord between the secular and ecclesiastical authority be dissolved it is clear that these men who years for a shameless liberty live in dread of an agreement which has always been fraught with good and advantageous alike to sacred and civil interests
7597638 human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of god and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the creator who is its sole end god alone is the lord of life from its beginning until its end no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being
7597639 i call on leaders in illinois and president bush in washington to stop playing politics on this critical issue and expand the current policy on embryonic stem cell research so that we can begin finding the cures of tomorrow today
7597640 i believe that we need to fund this this is a tough issue for those of us in the pro life community i would remind you that these stem cells are either going to be discarded or perpetually frozen we need to do what we can to relieve human suffering its a tough issue i support federal funding
7597641 whoever takes the life of any human being shall be put to death
7597642 i renew the appeal for a consensus to end the death penalty
7597643 the catechism of the catholic church invokes principles which do not exclude absolutely capital punishment but give very severe criteria for its moral use it seems to me it would be very difficult to meet the conditions today
7597644 so heinous so beyond the pale that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment
7597645 thus the judiciary committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the united states for a woman to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy
7597646 before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you
7597647 one who commits homicide or who fraudulently or forcibly kidnaps detains mutilates or seriously wounds a person is to be punished with the deprivations and prohibitions mentioned in can 1336 in accord with the seriousness of the offense however homicide against the persons mentioned in can 1370 is punished by the penalties specified there
7597648 a person who procures a successful abortion incurs an automatic excommunication
7597649 persons who procure abortion mothers not excepted automatically incur excommunication reserved to the ordinary at the moment the crime takes effect if they are clerics they shall also be deposed
7597650 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception from the first moment of his existences a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life
7597651 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7597652 a person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae
7597653 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
7597654 what is your view on the decision on partial birth abortion and your reaction to most of the public agreeing with the courts holding sen obama responded
7597655 i think that most americans recognize that this is a profoundly difficult issue for the women and families who make these decisions they dont make them casually and i trust women to make these decisions in conjunction with their doctors and their families and their clergy and i think thats where most americans are now when you describe a specific procedure that accounts for less than 1 of the abortions that take place then naturally people get concerned and i think legitimately so but the broader issue here is do women have the right to make these profoundly difficult decisions and i trust them to do it there is a broader issue can we move past some of the debates around which we disagree and can we start talking about the things we do agree on reducing teen pregnancy making it less likely for women to find themselves in these circumstances
7597656 this is something that i have not come to a firm resolution on i dont presume to know the answer to that question
7597657 i am pro life and an advocate for the rights of man everywhere in the world because to be denied liberty is an offense to nature and natures creator
7597658 i think the respect and commitment to the rights of the unborn is something ive fought for and it has a lot to do with national security because it says very much what kind of a country we are and our respect for human life whether it be here in the u s or anyplace else in the world so i think it is connected
7597659 i dont believe they should advocate abortion with my tax dollars
7597660 i think that i would give the benefit of the doubt to the person who alleges that
7597661 a person who commits a homicide or who kidnaps detains mutilates or gravely wounds a person by force or fraud is to be punished with the privations and prohibitions mentioned in can 1336 according to the gravity of the delict homicide against the persons mentioned in can 1370 however is to be punished by the penalties established there
7597662 whatever its motives and means direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of handicapped sick or dying persons it is morally unacceptable thus an act or omission which of itself or by intention causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living god his creator the error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not change the nature of this murderous act which must always be forbidden and excluded
7597663 the directly intended termination of any patients life even at his own request is always morally wrong
7597664 i should like particularly to underline how the administration of water and food even when provided by artificial means always represents a natural means of preserving life not a medical act its use furthermore should be considered in principle ordinary and proportionate and as such morally obligatory insofar as and until it is seen to have attained its proper finality which in the present case consists in providing nourishment to the patient and alleviation of his suffering
7597665 scripture in fact clearly excludes every form of the kind of self determination of human existence that is presupposed in the theory and practice of euthanasia
7597666 while the church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace not war and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
7597667 whatever its motives and means direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of handicapped sick or dying persons it is morally unacceptable
7597668 everyone is responsible for his life before god who has given it to him it is god who remains the sovereign master of life we are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor and the salvation of our souls we are stewards not owners of the life god has entrusted to us it is not ours to dispose of
7597669 if suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example especially to the young it also takes on the gravity of scandal voluntary co operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law
7597670 i am in favor of palliative medicine in circumstances where someone is terminally ill im mindful of the legitimate interests of states to prevent a slide from palliative treatments into euthanasia on the other hand i think that the people of oregon did a service for the country in recognizing that as the population gets older weve got to think about issues of end of life care
7597671 that allowed congress to interject itself in the schiavo case into the decision making process of the families
7597672 i think we have to be very careful in making end of life decisions
7597673 and by relieve that pain you mean hasten the end of life if they choose too
7597674 well yeah and i think there are there have to be very strict guidelines to insure that somebody whos making a decision to relieve their pain that might take a week away from their life just because they are slipping into a coma quicker for example that that is distinguished from or there is a possibility they slip into a coma that thats distinguished from euthanasia in which someone else is making a decision for them
7597675 i think its easy in hindsight to make a judgment
7597676 everyone is responsible for his life before god who has given it to him it is god who remains the sovereign master of life we are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor and the salvation of our souls we are stewards not owners of the life god has entrusted to us it is not ours to dispose of
7597677 not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia for example if a catholic were to be at odds with the holy father on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage way he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive holy communion while the church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace not war and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
7597678 a catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil and so unworthy to present himself for holy communion if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidates permissive stand on abortion and or euthanasia
7597679 when a catholic does not share a candidates stand in favour of abortion and or euthanasia but votes for that candidate for other reasons it is considered remote material cooperation which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons 73
7597680 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise therof
7597681 has any american city ever benefited from african american leadership
7597682 to leverage the resources and reach all these platforms we had to come up with an additional platform in the form of junction k which will act as a cross media platform for brands
7597683 implies the integration of the communication message by placing it effectively on different media such as tv print radio online outdoor etc with a common identifiable theme
7597684 our team of marketers researchers and media specialists analyse the feedback provided by our local marketing people and sit down to design a specialised advertising marketing strategy for the brand our footprint across kerala allows us to come up with an integrated plan that places the brand or service on different platforms at different touchpoints
7597685 the dsm monitors are a logical next step as we expand our position as a leader in the studio monitor market
7597686 were really pleased with the result of this collaboration between m audio and digidesign the quality of the dsm series speaks for itself
7597687 was how one pakistani source recently described the situation in his country to me the country has been plunged into further turmoil
7597688 id respond that thats nonsense look at the payroll if you split the big city markets with two teams new york los angeles chicago seattle is the 18 th biggest market in the league the payroll as of the all star break was sixth or seventh thats commitment of ownership
7597689 i keep scratching my head what more could ownership do if wed made the right decisions along the way wed be right there if what we were worried about was making a profit wed lower payroll not raise it
7597690 im greatly heartened by our fan base and how theyve stuck with us through thick and thin they are very savvy baseball fans and i think that were sixth in the american league in attendance and its a reflection on the fans and their knowledge base
7597691 i just wanted to let the players know that ownership absolutely believes that were in this we absolutely believe were in this fight and that well be in it until the end winning takes determination courage and heart and its time to bring that into the open in a big way i just told derek its got to start with you youre the captain and he knows that it was a good meeting very positive
7597692 i can only speak for myself i know weve got a good team i know weve got a good team and i wanted to convey that to derek so he could convey that to his teammates he knows hes the captain he knows it has to start with him its like that in any sport in anything in life
7597693 he realizes that he realizes his responsibilities theres no more class act than derek jeter derek jeters not the kind to not give 110 percent and thats in anything
7597694 i think if you say you need to do more now it implies that youre not doing your job at different times i dont think you just say things when people are struggling or things are going bad you try to do the same things all the time
7597695 i think the expectation level remains the same the steinbrenners still give us every opportunity to win just like they always have just because hal and hank are more upfront now doesnt change the expectations
7597696 thats why i have to point out the injuries because the media sweep that under the rug and say were playing poorly but next year in a new stadium well be much better well add players were gonna be very tough next season
7597697 all the guys on the bench theyre all talking to each other
7597698 i see the ball in the dirt the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base hes called out according to the rule i didnt see him because im watching pudge with the ball so thats why i had to ask for help what did mora do and they all agreed that he abandoned his effort to go to first and thats why he was called out
7597699 im walking to the dugout im looking in the stands and then i go to put my glove down and i turn around and everyones still on the field
7597700 im behind in the count almost every guy they hit the ball they made good swings but a lot of their hits were finding holes and thats what happens when youre behind in the count and youre using soft stuff
7597701 kind of grown out of it got a little bored its time for me to do something more productive with my mind and body and i feel like chess is a little better for problem solving and to just sharpen your mind
7597702 in pences case its more about the mental side of the game a couple of instances on the bases that are a little frustrating i think to us and him
7597703 its something i want to pick up and start playing just reading about it it seems like a fun game and anything to sharpen your mind
7597704 it was the only way to get both guys in the lineup were committed to chris as a big part of our club going forward if he shows he can play at third base that gives us an option its hard to imagine a 2009 team without him in it
7597705 for them to say go ahead and play first so you can stay on the field is real exciting for me i hate to be healthy as a hitter and not be able to play i hate that
7597706 coming off the all star break i thought i would be able to play third base for the rest of the year but that didnt happen now i want to finish the season strong im excited to be back in the big leagues and playing with the guys my body feels great now i just want to go out and have some fun
7597707 i know if they throw one in the wrong spot hank will take a hack at it if they hit a ground ball at him hell catch it if they throw a ball at him hell catch it and step on first thats all he needs to do hanks a pro
7597708 we need hanks bat in the lineup however we have to get it in there im more than capable of going over there and playing
7597709 if i do well at third and thats where they need me then thats where ill play they havent told me as far as next year they said for right now thats the move that needs to be made well see what happens down the road
7597710 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
7597711 ill comment after i hear what he says i know they were doing some tests on things that the commissioner and jimmie lee solomon were working on it ive been talking to solomon about other things thats been the furthest thing from my mind
7597712 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
7597713 i thought it was going to be in the dugout i thought it was going to be in a camera well but it sounds like its just going to be away from the field
7597714 its one play a week maybe where its a borderline home run call its not something thats going to slow down that many games there wont be any argument from either side you cant really argue with videotape
7597715 listen the performance lately has been a little rougher than anyone would like to go through but we didnt make any bones about what we were going to do when we said we were going to go through a rebuilding
7597716 ive seen all of their minor league guys and believe me when i say this billy did a good thing of all the organizations ive seen they have the best talent ive seen this year he has a plan
7597717 i have five different reports on gallagher over the years from the midwest league to the majors before we make a trade we have three four five different points of view we had billy owens see him pittaro and oakland based pro scout will schock from a scouting point of view thats critical to us
7597718 part of it is that we played so well before the break it seems like rebuilding happens overnight and it doesnt last year we were in third place our payroll was growing beyond our means and we had no farm system now were in third place but have the system we wanted and our payroll has been reduced to the point that we have more flexibility to do some other things
7597719 one of the things that billy owens does is sit behind the pitchers and talk to them constantly billy said greg was an intellectual guy who understands the game he understands his own ability and what he has to do to succeed hes not going to blow you away with his ability but he was very impressed with what he does with his ability whats interesting is the perception of oakland because of the book is that scouting is not a big part of what we do nothing could be further from the truth
7597720 everything weve done since the haren trade has been billys vision he recognized early on even last season that we were neglecting player development and scouting to the detriment of the organization this has all been by his design
7597721 were taking our licks right now but were going to come back next year and be unbelievable when everyone here figures out what were doing we can pull off something like tampa bay has this year no one here should have their heads down
7597722 thats just the way it is right now with two teams out of it its all about pace of game so they call a lot of first pitch strikes so everyone starts swinging the bat its a frustrating way to hit
7597723 enough is enough if im not patient im not doing my job if they continue to do that purposely i dont have time for that but thats the way its going to be the rest of the season ive seen it happen before
7597724 i was trying to finish the year strong and instead im basically spinning my wheels its tough i want to make things happen im not here just to be here if i didnt care id just drag the bat up there and then drag it back to the dugout
7597725 i was kedar hunter all the way up until my senior year in high school
7597726 im sitting there watching him and im thinking this is a major league pitcher i know i can do this not to downgrade him but once i saw him live and in person doing what he was doing i knew that i could do it
7597727 its always a pleasure to watch a player who has those unique abilities that eric has as a scout you fill out the box with power with fielding with the ability to hit ability to throw with eric it was very easy you filled out every box
7597728 when i was 12 i think thats like the first year they started doing it when kids were 12 and austin jackson was in there as the number one kid at 12 i told my dad when i was 13 thats what i want to do thats my goal this year so i went out and every national tournament i went to i played awesome i pitched well i hit well at that time it was like a big deal now when you look at it it really doesnt matter at all what do you really care how good you are when youre 13 but back then it was a huge deal it was awesome
7597729 well be fine bro we go through this shit every year at the end of the day well take another ring with us
7597730 were trying to reward a guy who came through our system and has turned himself into a suspect at least for a while dirk was a guy who we thought only had organizational value but hes continued to impress he has three major league pitches throws strikes
7597731 these are very very very tough decisions this is a difficult situation even for luis castillo weve played extremely well without him weve put ourselves in the pennant race he wouldnt want to mess that up for the team its kind of touchy but luis is a one time world champion who is accustomed to winning so you cant dismiss that as well
7597732 i would say it was the best one i have had this year it was a special
7597733 they are a very special group of well trained and friendly people many of whom i have been fortunate enough to work with for many years
7597734 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7597735 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7597736 of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7597737 it was in very poor taste and brought about by those who have no regard for people in my constituency who have suffered
7597738 i do find it utterly extraordinary that if were trying to promote britain we should do so with an image of an mass child murder
7597739 somebody somewhere has taken an extraordinary decision that i dont think brings any credit on the country at all
7597740 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7597741 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7597742 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect

7597746 we wanted to play much better to open up the stadium but it didnt happen they outplayed us tonight
7597747 offensively we didnt have a lot of rhythm but we didnt have the ball a lot
7597748 in the second half we had a chance to get back in it but the turnovers really took the wind out of our sails
7597749 he handled the information we got in and out it was a noisy game and it could have been noisier but we got off to that good start
7597750 the touchdown was a plus but it could have been a whole lot better
7597751 weve got to get back to protecting the ball like the colts normally do
7597752 i told the team after the game that this was kind of a normal nfl game
7597753 if you could keep from turning the ball over and can win the turnover battle youll have a real good chance of winning the game thats what happened
7597754 we can move in next door to any starbucks and compete with them

7597772 going with biden highlights the horns of the dilemma for senator obama he wanted someone who could reinforce his message of change but he needed someone with experience so he was forced into sacrificing one at the expense of the other

7598062 it would be an offence against the principles of elemental justice if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right to return to their homes while jewish immigrants flow into palestine
7598063 the palestinian refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which under principles of international law or in equity should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible

7598065 the catastrophic expulsion of the palestinian people from their homeland in 1948 is a historic injustice that demands the attention of the entire world americans israelis and jews in every nation must especially give heed to this astonishing collection of masterful essays far from being a melancholy assemblage of anger and self pity this book is a major political and scholarly achievement reflecting deeply on the traumatic roots of national identity the role of memory and amnesia history and mythical narrative legal doctrine and eyewitness testimony womens experience mens business and lost places found again in song story and film this is essential reading for anyone who longs for a just settlement to the question of palestine the question of the middle east or indeed the establishment of a world order of peace and justice

7598076 our sense is that the potential impact from parity pay in the u k market likely wouldnt be very dramatic as compensation for robert half internationals temp employees is probably not too far away from an equivalent permanent employee

7598090 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7598091 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7598092 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7598093 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7598094 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7598095 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7598096 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce while we must look after the children who have been abused we must do much more to stop it happening to others

7598150 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7598151 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7598152 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7598153 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7598154 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster

7598172 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7598173 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7598174 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here

7598181 he needs a big win in a major getting to the quarters is not going to do it
7598182 he needs a victory over nadal or federer or djokovic to spark him he is a like a shooter in a basketball who can get hot his big serve can serve him well and andy knows better than most than any time he walks through the gates at flushing meadows something special can happen
7598183 our volunteers and supporters are the backbone of what we do so it just seemed right that we all be together for this great occasion
7598184 we have a great venue with plenty of big screen tvs so everybody will have the best seat in the house
7598185 i am pleased to promote two hard working public servants to their new positions as the directors of these very important agencies both maureen odonnell and james sledge have proven themselves and their leadership capabilities have grown during their years of service in this administration
7598186 i am confident that james sledge will help lead cms into a new era of excellence and i look forward to all the great things that will come from his appointment in this difficult national economy we need someone like maureen odonnell to help illinoisans searching for work to get back on their feet and find new employment or possibly a new career
7598187 i have worked very hard throughout my career to serve the citizens of cook county and our great state
7598188 this is an exciting move for me and i am honored to be placed in a position where i can positively affect the lives of millions of people and help to make state government better

7598193 if you read blogs you know that there is this conversation and that some articles are the talk of the day and other posts have important things to say about those
7598194 if you built graphs in your mind of what the talk looks like i think it looks like what ive done i get the sense memeorandum is just a natural representation of what is already going on
7598195 the best way for someone to get into the blogs thing is to find a blog that is tracking an issue important to you because someone new to it can understand the headline and then go read the blog i think my site works pretty well that way
7598196 my dad started using my site a couple weeks later he spotted something he was interested in and now he knows all these bloggers
7598197 the main items can be a journalism piece a blog post or a press release but the discussion is so cool since its like instant editorials which is what most blog posts are memeorandum is much easier than doing a search on the link and for myself and others like robert scoble it has disrupted how we use the web
7598198 i have 400 feeds and reading those takes me four hours and i was doing that every morning
7598199 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7598200 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7598201 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7598202 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7598203 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7598204 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up

7598206 they deserve to know if their school of choice ignores fundamental rights schools on fires red alert list must understand that we will not stop exposing their illiberal behavior until they honor their obligations under the first amendment and their own promises of freedom of expression
7598207 readers need to understand that these five red alert schools represent only a handful of the hundreds of serious abuses of free speech and basic liberties that fire has seen over the years what sets red alert schools apart is their refusal to reverse their intrusions on the rights of students and faculty members
7598208 fire hopes that by the time we publicize our red alert list next year all of these schools will have redeemed themselves and their commitment to campus rights given their stubborn refusal to do so thus far however we are not holding our breath

7598215 a report from the russian front in the global fight against drug scientific american
7598216 el poder destructivo de las drogas es una amarga realidad que enfrenta el mundo
7598217 la drogadicci n es una enfermedad que afecta el cerebro es cr nica
7598218 contrariamente a lo que se cree culturalmente la adicci n es una enfermedad que reside en el cerebro por muchos a os hemos tratado de entender en qu reas de este rgano est la patolog a
7598219 permiten sentir placer que nos motivan en las actividades diarias los de memoria y aprendizaje al final de cuentas la drogadicci n es una memoria poderosa que cambia el valor de los diferentes est mulos que motivan a un individuo a actuar
7598220 es un problema de desajuste de los sistemas del placer de memoria y afecta los centros cognitivos que permiten ejercer un juicio adecuado hacer un an lisis de una situaci n y tomar una decisi n
7598221 desajustan varios circuitos cerebrales y la persona pierde la capacidad de control al mismo tiempo que la habilidad de percibir placer por los eventos o est mulos naturales y en la b squeda del que ya no encuentran caen en una carrera de tomar drogas para compensarlo
7598222 se puede tratar existen tratamientos efectivos para este problema algunos de los cambios en el cerebro se recuperan pero debe darse un tratamiento sostenido desgraciadamente no hay uno que cure totalmente pero se puede controlar y la persona puede llevar una vida normal
7598223 otro aspecto es el sistema educativo escolar a trav s de la educaci n de los maestros pero tambi n a trav s de la organizaci n de la escuela que mantenga un control sobre el uso de drogas
7598224 un tercer factor tiene que ver con las actividades sociales de un adolescente la mayor parte de la experimentaci n de drogas ocurre en esta etapa porque es de b squeda en la cual se toman riesgos
7598225 un cuarto componente muy importante es el acceso a las drogas si stas son muy accesibles hay m s probabilidad de que las tome es por eso que el mayor impacto desde el punto de vista de salud actualmente no son las drogas il citas sino que son las legales el alcohol y el cigarro
7598226 fourth year in a row of double digit increases for illinois farm real estate values
7598227 the 5 000 per acre figure includes the value of all land and buildings
7598228 the figure is 15 5 percent higher than the 2007 average of 4 330 per acre this increase marks the fourth year in a row of double digit increases
7598229 the 2005 value increased 27 6 percent the 2006 value increased 14 1 percent and the 2007 value increased 13 9 percent the 2008 percent increase was the second highest since 1977

7598231 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7598232 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7598233 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7598234 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

7598580 when ukraine prioritizes its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
7598581 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
7598582 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
7598583 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
7598584 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
7598585 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
7598586 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario

7598593 by susan saulny the southeastern louisiana coast is sinking fast into the gulf of mexico still its lifeblood but now also its nemesis
7598594 coastal erosion is eating away at the culture the livelihood and quite tangibly the land itself at the ravenous rate of 12 square miles to more than 20 square miles a year
7598595 the louisiana coast depended for thousands of years on the routine overflow of the mississippi river to deposit its sediment load and build land but beginning around the 1930s in order to save lives and cities the federal government built massive levees to constrain and control the river effectively stopping it from doing what nature wants it to do as a result for the past 70 years or so the sinking of the delta coast has continued unabated as salt water pushes inland from the gulf it kills wetlands and marshes habitat for wildlife and fish and is increasingly threatening homes for many thousands of people

7598608 sweat is very corrosive sweat and blood will rust many stainless steels i hate to handle my guns or drip on them when i sweat it really helps to just wipe them good with a wet rag dry and wipe on a light coating of gun oil i think most stainless barrels are made from type 416 stainless and it is generally pretty corrosion resistant but not when exposed to sweat blood or chlorates corrosive priming and some other electrolytes
7598609 the basic resistance of stainless steel occurs because of its ability to form a protective coating on the metal surface this coating is a passive film which resists further oxidation or rusting the formation of this film is instantaneous in an oxidizing atmosphere such as air water or other fluids that contain oxygen once the layer has formed we say that the metal has become passivated and the oxidation or rusting rate will slow down to less than 0 002 per year 0 05 mm per year unlike aluminum or silver this passive film is invisible in stainless steel its created when oxygen combines with the chrome in the stainless to form chrome oxide which is more commonly called ceramic this protective oxide or ceramic coating is common to most corrosion resistant materials halogen salts especially chlorides easily penetrate this passive film and will allow corrosive attack to occur the halogens are easy to recognize because they end in the letters ine listed in order of their activity they are fluorine chlorine bromine iodine astatine these are the same chemicals that will penetrate teflon and cause trouble with teflon coated or encapsulated o rings and or similar coated materials chlorides are one of the most common elements in nature and if that isnt bad enough theyre also soluble active ions these provide the basis for electrolytes the presence of electrolytic solutions can accelerate corrosion or chemical attack

7598614 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded

7598762 we want to work with you to identify active catholic voters throughout the country in this respect we need your help in requesting parish directory and membership lists of catholic groups and associations
7598763 access to these directories is critical as it allows us to identify and contact those catholics who are likely to be supportive of president bushs compassionate conservative agenda please forward any directories you are able to collect to my attention
7598764 at the march for life and the adjoining conservative political action conference we enlisted an estimated one thousand new catholic team leaders
7598765 each catholic field coordinator will be responsible for implementing our plan of organizing a vibrant and efficient network of catholics in each target state
7598766 dear fellow catholic president bush had significant success in winning catholic support in 2000 and republicans across america were able to build on that success in 2002 the republican trend among catholics was reflected even more strongly among church going catholics catholics across america have responded to president bushs leadership and his efforts to build a more compassionate america and ensure that human life is protected the republican national committees catholic team leader outreach aims to build on these historic successes and is working with the catholic community to ensure that priorities important to catholics become a reality including the presidents faith based initiative and his efforts to build a more compassionate america by helping people in need through continued job creation the hard work and advice of catholics around the nation will continue to be essential in advancing these important policy initiatives and theres no better way to get involved than through the rncs catholic outreach please join our effort today by becoming a catholic team leader

7598772 we lose about 35 000 a year in materials that are checked out and not returned
7598773 those overdue fees and fines they do add up so at our library with the size of our community in fort smith we take in about 100 000 every year
7598774 if people dont bring their books back the library may start charging more in late fees for other people to make up for what people dont pay

7598798 californian voters have shown they want to treat animals more humanely including animals that are used for food
7598799 there is an extremely competitive market for egg production as costs for the care of animals go up so will the price of eggs
7598800 this will cause the consumers to decrease the spending on eggs and making the farmers lose money it would no longer be competitive and farms would have to shut down thereby having californians get their eggs from out of state and mexico
7598801 proposition 2 wont change how eggs are produced it will only change where they are produced
7598802 i am excited about our research as i believe that the more we understand the basic mechanisms by which bacillus anthracis anthrax interacts with the human host to cause disease the better equipped we will be in designing therapies and preventative treatments
7598803 in this current study we show that the anthrax bacterium blocks this signaling process meaning the bacteria and specifically the toxins turn off those same genes
7598804 thus the immune response is impaired which gives the bacteria free reign to continue spreading into the brain to cause disease
7598805 we are helping them develop a four year english language curriculum so that the faculty will actually prepare afghan students to earn a degree in the english language
7598806 we also would expect that nangarhar faculty will have upgraded both their knowledge of english their knowledge of teaching and the development of a thorough curriculum in the english language
7598807 they were quite interested in my research and passed it around internally to a few select people
7598808 something like this technology could be embedded in tables and work surfaces so as soon as you put down an appropriately equipped device it would immediately begin drawing power
7598809 in the future your kitchen counters might do it youd just drop your espresso maker down on them and you would never have to plug it in
7598810 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7598811 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7598812 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7598813 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7598814 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7598815 the idea had kind of been floating around because people had noticed these bats with no injuries
7598816 when people were first starting to talk about the issue it was bats running into the turbine blades we always said no bats dont run into things bats can detect and avoid all kinds of structures
7598817 i can pick up nine different species of bird i can pick up two species of bat
7598818 but the larger the animal is the bigger the air pressure drop has to be we know that four kilopascals a unit of pressure is enough to kill a rat bats are much smaller we found that these wind turbines produce a five to 10 kilopascal drop
7598819 its one of those things we have speculated on for a long time
7598820 its an important finding on the cause of the fatalities theyre not offered much room for error if they avoid being struck at the last minute they still may be killed by this rapid change in air pressure
7598821 it may not lead us directly to any solution whether theyre getting struck or theyre dying from the barotrauma may or may not make any difference we have to find ways to keep them away from the turbines
7598822 there are a lot of people testing different forms of mitigation
7598823 right now the most promising one is to shut turbines down during slow wind speeds during the fall migration at night
7598824 while we are seeing a slight decline in travel this labor day holiday it is a small improvement over the fourth of july holiday when we saw a drop of 1 3 percent
7598825 this may show that travelers are starting to respond to the recent drop in gasoline prices
7598826 to provide edgy plus size attire so women can be confident no matter what their size we want larger women to no longer be seen as second class citizens
7598827 we get our inspirations from nature consumer culture life current and ancient indigenous peoples
7598828 i dont think were in the fashion world insider secret they call this the rag business were motivated by taking an idea on paper and turning it into a virus or something that spreads
7598829 fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months
7598830 the mayor is very supportive of this event in chula vista and welcomes it
7598831 we just dont issue proclamations for city community events just like we dont issue proclamations for events like the lemon festival the cinco de mayo celebration bonitafest and the starlight parade
7598832 the mayor wasnt going to make the parade a city issue because she felt it wasnt as relevant to city business
7598833 for instance were dealing with the issue of the state budget right now and that is an issue the mayor would jump into with both feet because it directly effects the citys ability to do business
7598834 i get inspired by nostalgia things from the 70s and 80s that remind me of my childhood
7598835 fashion is a medium that allows me to express my own unique style and individuality

7598842 the aztec invitational is really going to be a tough tournament
7598843 irvine is always solid and they have one of the best outside hitters around albany made it to the second round of the ncaa tournament last year and they have a few international kids who are scary good and usd is ranked in the top 20 right now
7598844 in our last 20 win season in 2002 we started out with a really tough tournament and didnt do particularly well
7598845 but the level of play was so good that it really set the tone for the rest of the season we ended 22 11 which is a pretty good season
7598846 this is definitely one of our better recruiting classes in a while
7598847 they jump really well they are very athletic and they are just very good volleyball players as of right now they fit in really well with what were trying to do as a team

7598853 love is always patient and kind love is never jealous love is not boastful or conceited it is never rude and never seeks its own advantage it does not take offence or store up grievances love does not rejoice at wrongdoing but finds its joy in the truth it is always ready to make allowances to trust to hope and to endure whatever comes love never comes to an end

7598855 oh no there is an emergency i have to go

7598871 what were looking to do right now is not looking at a wind farm although not ruling that out down the road
7598872 if it was feasible and it worked out well and there wasnt a lot of uproar in the community about it we have other sites that might also lend themselves to wind but thats not anything that weve done any planning for or have in the works
7598873 with where the power costs and everything seem to be going it seemed like it was maybe a good time to start
7598874 its a fairly long process so weve got probably almost a year of data collection to assess the feasibility
7598875 this should not imply any kind of predisposition to approve a permanent facility
7598876 i feel like this is a brave new world and id like more input than the several of us
7598877 i think its a laudable goal i think there are just lots of people that have strong opinions about tall structures that impede view sheds
7598878 all i can say is that were following every lead and were obviously looking at the windfarm as a possible source of the start of the landslide
7598879 it will take a number of years before they can recolonise and rejuvenate that area
7598880 the river feale has continually produced good stocks of salmon so any blow to that would be very severe in the national terms
7598881 while searching for bat carcasses under wind turbines we noticed that many of the carcasses had no external injuries or no visible cause of death
7598882 if bats are killed in canada that could have consequences for ecosystems as far away as mexico

7599035 okay if i had to suck a cock it would be his
7599036 for me as a christian it is a sacred union god is in the mix

7599038 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
7599039 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
7599040 as a nation we are all better off for having had a forum like this
7599041 its a great service to the public square i think to see the candidates reaction to questions that many people want to have asked and are interested in hearing but so many of the media and political gatekeepers arent interested in communicating
7599042 jarno its going to be a long hot day it looks like
7599043 yesss it look liiiikkkkke it feel liiiiikkkkke its going to be a tough race because anyway its lonngggggg its hotttttt its harddddd the circuittttt
7599044 yeah obviously i wanna qualify better and my goal is to be as close to the front as possible but ah also close to fernando is good if were in the back that means the cars no good fernandos close to me and i think thats a good reason its not good when fernando is qualifying in top five and im not even in q2 tough weekend for us but its a street race lot of things happen around here so we have to have a bit of luck
7599045 thanks a lot nelson i think i got the gist of what he was trying to say anyway
7599046 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7599047 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine
7599048 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us

7599066 yeah i think its really interesting it makes sense you need to see the real implications of what youre being taught we only usually see within our own subject so the chance to mix with the others is good

7599620 an idealistic wife in 1950s connecticut who realizes that her dreams and freedom have withered away
7599621 so she persuades her husband the debonair leonardo dicaprio to rediscover the thing that made their marriage vital
7599622 i wont give away too much but lets just say that dicaprio goes along for the ride for a bit but soon reality sets in and theyve got to make some life altering changes lets just say not only was dicaprios character balling sic by the end but most of the audience was too
7599623 meaning what that he fancies himself a ladies man because his gross animal member is almost as large as dirk digglers liked it also a little bit less than schmucko feldman but hes a mmore explicit writer and seems more thoughtful and circumspect
7599624 this sets the mood for how this movie is going to be april is a failed actress depressed housewife and frank is a failure working at a crappy job he hates because he feels hes becoming his dad
7599625 dicaprio and winslet give oscar worthy perfomances throughout the film their fights are intense one in particular gave me the chills you can see the anguish behind aprils eyes as she goes on each day hiding the fact that shes miserable when april comes up with the idea to move to france and start over you can see happiness reenter both of their lives and you really hope that everything works out for them those whove read the book know that this is only wishful thinking for those that haven i dont want to spoil the results
7599626 they couldve had a perfect ending that left you feeling for the characters but they tacked on some scenes at the end that were unnecessary and they failed to give you any time to process what happened to the characters
7599627 overall though i really enjoyed the film the acting kept the movie afloat and im sure well see a couple names from this movie among the oscar nominations for sam mendes this is not as good as american beauty but still a great job
7599628 it shows the level of desperation and abuse of power by the barisan nasional

7599631 the issue of the sodomy allegations while it gained some traction at the beginning of the campaign by the end had reached saturation point and wont significantly affect his chances of winning
7599632 if you look at the ground support it is extremely good but we have to make sure there is no cheating

7599828 we may make some changes ive always felt a good game plan is when you have to eliminate things throughout the week i dont like to add things i like to eliminate
7599829 we want to start the season as high as we can and then with reps just get better the main thing is we have to play at the highest level that we can play and give it our best effort i believe in these guys i know they will play to the best of their ability
7599830 its been a fast seven months its flown by and this camp has flown by and this season is going to fly by things are going fast but were having fun we have to continue to get better and strive to get better thats what were working hard toward
7599831 back in high school jon medeiros was known as the passing threat in kapoleis dual quarterback offense while kaipo noa kaheaku enhada was dangerous running the option and as a receiver now that theyre in college kaheaku enhada has established himself as navys quarterback while medeiros has been among hawaiis more reliable receivers in fall camp
7599832 it gave me a better understanding high school and college defenses are a lot different alignments are a lot different but it did help me out
7599833 it helps out a lot when i first came here i was able to read coverages pretty quick because we ran an offense in high school pretty similar to this one similar to saint louis offense my understanding of what the quarterback goes through in the offense adapts to me as a receiver
7599834 medeiros aptitude before the snap and his knack for finding soft spots in the secondary have helped him carve out a regular place in the slotback rotation as the warriors head toward saturdays season opener at no 5 florida medeiros a 5 foot 9 junior has been running with the second unit in practices as he and kealoha pilares back up seniors mike washington and aaron bain
7599835 first of all hes smart i liked what he did last wednesday when we went live caught the ball in a crowd found the open areas he knows the system kealoha and jon are coming theyre right there i wouldnt be afraid to have them play were going to have to use them so theyre coming along nicely
7599836 like coach greg mcmackin says it takes a lot of reps in order to get this stuff down on offense as far as receivers and qbs its more getting a feel for knowing where people are on the field before the snap of the ball confidence is a big thing too the more reps you get the more confident you get catching the ball running your route
7599837 he was so versatile he was able to fill both roles for us he just lives and breathes football hes the kind of kid you love to coach so im not surprised hes finding his niche at uh as a receiver hes not the biggest or the fastest guy around hes all guts and heart and guile and finds a way to make it happen
7599838 im very proud of him its kind of a trip to know the same person who was playing quarterback with me is doing it big in college beating notre dame last year i was real happy for him

7599861 when liquid wastes are injected there is a pressure increase near the injection well during the period of injection most of this pressure decreases very quickly as the liquid which is forced into the porous rock formation spreads away from the injection wells although it takes a period several times longer than the period of injection for the pressure to dissipate completely this pressure due to injection is the force which is most likely to cause contamination of drinkable water if there are paths by which the waste can move upward into underground sources of drinking water this pressure will cause that movement to occur however because the waste must pass through many layers of rock there is little chance that the amount of vertical movement will be sufficient to allow contaminants to reach underground sources of drinking water
