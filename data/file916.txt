9160001 no tenemos miedo a nada ni siquiera a la perspectiva de una guerra fr a aunque no la queremos

9160004 we are delighted with the calibre and variety of entries that we have received for this inaugural festival and narrowing the finalists down to 33 from over 250 submissions has been more difficult than any of us ever imagined
9160005 each film relates to the experience of cancer but content and creative execution varies wildly many films challenge preconceptions about what it means to live with cancer they tap into the full range of human emotions even humour i have great admiration for anyone who has not only the courage to fight the disease but also to share his or her experience with us on film these films are nothing less than a celebration of life
9160006 the launch of this film festival is significant especially to anyone who has been touched by cancer
9160007 the reel lives festival brings the worlds attention to what it means to live with cancer and frames its significant social impact around the world
9160008 even though the use of statin therapy in elderly patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis has increased substantially during the past decade our study showed many patients remain untreated
9160009 this was especially evident in patients with cvd and pad with data from january to march in 2004 that indicated that less than 50 percent of these patients were on statins
9160010 our findings highlight the treatment care gaps in patients with atherosclerosis and may be useful for guiding medical interventions focusing continuing medical education programs encouraging active discussions on risk reduction therapies at scientific meetings and other educational outreach programs that aim to bring physicians practice into agreement with current guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction
9160011 it is the honor of my life to represent you as your governor and over the next two months i will continue to do so as the mother of five i know how to multi task and i will continue to promote the path of reform that we set out on together in the state of alaska
9160012 it is a great privilege to be john mccains running mate and to be considered by the american people for the vice presidency this honor is a testament to the reforms and progress we have made together in alaska now is the time to take that spirit of reform to washington
9160013 i look forward to working with affected parties to find the necessary solutions that will lead to more affordable health care for alaskans i support flexibility in government regulations that allow competition in health care that is needed and is proven to be good for the consumer which will drive down health care costs and reduce the need for government subsidies i also support patients in their rightful demands to have access to full medical billing information
9160014 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between and man and a woman
9160015 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
9160016 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
9160017 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
9160018 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
9160019 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
9160020 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
9160021 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
9160022 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
9160023 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
9160024 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
9160025 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
9160026 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
9160027 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air

9160034 there is no clear evidence that positive or negative experiences can affect breast cancer risk emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
9160035 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
9160036 breast cancer is a complex disease and there is unlikely to be one single cause
9160037 learco chindamo jailed for life for stabbing to death the father of four in 1995 has been given a new identity it is thought that the 27 year old has been moved to a secret address away from london where he grew up and where his mother stepfather and brothers lived during his 12 years in prison according to reports chindamo was released from ford open prison about three weeks ago he has been given a living allowance and provided with 24 hour police protection via a panic button details of his whereabouts are being closely guarded by officials for his own safety

9160040 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9160041 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9160042 it was entirely my responsibility to look out for my canine partner obviously in this instance i failed to do so

9160113 but mentally he has that killer instinct eddie guardado had he can run a pitch up there 92 93 miles an hour and sink it and he goes right after anybody

9160127 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
9160128 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
9160129 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
9160130 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
9160131 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
9160132 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
9160133 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging
9160134 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
9160135 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
9160136 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to

9160179 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
9160180 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
9160181 if you see a deer take careful aim on it and ill come running back as soon as i hear the shot
9160182 take my kevins much kinder and more philosophical way of asking are you bullshitting me
9160183 i think i went out and did what they wanted me to do showed them i can play football and make plays im just waiting to see if i make the team or not
9160184 i think that was the most important tackle i had all night
9160185 they know what i can do on defense but i wanted to come out and show them what i can do on special teams by going out and making tackles
9160186 i knew special teams were going to be very important for me thats what makes and breaks players if you can play special teams or not more than anything i was trying to put more of an emphasis on special teams than defense but as it turned out it seemed like i put more emphasis on defense
9160187 hes taken what he did in college and transformed it to this camp
9160188 the area where he needs to improve is in the passing game hes been working very hard at that we knew that would be a challenge for him but hes getting better at it it wouldve been nice to see him tip that ball down in the end zone a 6 yard touchdown pass from erik ainge to david ball that went over mays head hell learn from that the next time hell be a foot deeper and jump an inch higher and be in the right position to make that play
9160189 pass coverage was something i needed to work on in college
9160190 once i got here they put a big emphasis on it i just worked my butt off week and week out and am starting to get better at it
9160191 we played a tampa 2 scheme in college which is a little similar to what jim johnson has here
9160192 i just carried over some of the verbiage that we used and just try to connect it with some of the things jim johnson does here it worked out for me a little bit im just glad i was able to learn that kind of stuff in college its helped me out here
9160193 after the second preseason game against carolina everything started to click i started to feel more comfortable out there i was thinking less and just trying to make plays
9160194 im used to moving around being at practice or playing the game now ive got to just sit around and wait and see if i made the team or not
9160195 i know i came out and put all my heart into it
9160196 well just have to wait and see what happens im upbeat about things and waiting for the next chapter in my life
9160197 you learn a lot of different ways but for me the best way to learn is to go out there and experience it for yourself
9160198 i think troy and kyle have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level
9160199 there are a couple of other decisions that wont be easy but thats a good thing
9160200 i told the guys the first day of camp that they need to make it as hard on tom and i as they possibly can
9160201 there are some spots here that are tough calls but well make the right ones
9160202 i feel my transition from pass rushing in college to the nfl has to get better
9160203 the tackles are a lot better than what i was used to in college i need to progress on getting better there
9160204 ive tried to work on the transition to the run but ive got to continue to get better playing this defense because the pass rush is a big part of this defense
9160205 i just went out there and played now it plays out with the coaches it was nice to go out and finish and play hard through a whole game the way i wanted to go
9160206 coming off the injury i think i did pretty good this game gave me confidence that i can stop the run there are still things i can do better it gave some confidence that i can play in the nfl
9160207 the coaches have decisions to make all around the board not just me
9160208 i put it in gods hands i played hard and let it all out on the field that has been my whole attitude throughout training camp leave it on the field continue to strive to get better
9160209 through my relationship with jesus christ i just stopped worrying about a lot of things
9160210 a lot of times young guys come into the league and are real tentative worrying about messing up they put a lot of things on their shoulders
9160211 its hard for them not to do that people expect so much out of you its good when you can turn it over to god and go out and play
9160212 the area that needs to improve is in the pass game and hes been working very hard on that
9160213 we knew that would be a challenge for him but hes getting better
9160214 if im making the plays i am supposed to i would be in the right spot
9160215 i think i could have done more could have done better overall i came out and made a couple of tackles and made a couple of plays im hoping that overrides everything else
9160216 if you dont know what you are doing on defense you got to make plays not that i didnt know what i was doing but there were times when i was in the wrong spot but i was still trying to make plays any way i could that shows up on film
9160217 he says that every week its the snack after the meeting there are other things you can eat but the cheeseburgers are always on the menu
9160218 i give my little talk and then i always finish it with ill treat you to a cheeseburger
9160219 there was a game during my third or fourth year when i didnt say it and all the players just sat there and kind of looked at me then they said hey hey you didnt say anything about the cheeseburger now i make sure i say it every time
9160220 heres all you need to know with a coach that looks like me youre going to eat good if nothing else youre going to eat good both home and away
9160221 me being a big guy i try to stay away from them
9160222 theyre pretty good though big sirloin burgers and i do love them
9160223 its just a walk through and youre pretty much looking to leave the building as soon as you get to the building because you know youre going to be gone by 11 in the morning at that point youre just looking forward to sunday
9160224 if i know somebody i like to watch those games
9160225 i know jim harbaugh so i watch stanford and i know charlie weis so maybe ill watch notre dame if i know a coach ill be more interested sometimes i fall asleep
9160226 for the quarterbacks we take a sort of test about the game plan then the team gets together and andy speaks hopefully you won the previous week because you get a highlight tape then you get a snack and you go to bed
9160227 we get a good review of our opponent and then we put in the first 15 plays
9160228 i laugh and joke with him at snack but he doesnt talk to me much that day
9160229 we talk more than enough during the week i think we run out of things to say on saturday the other thing i do on saturday is call home and give my good nights and i love yous i talk to my daughter before i go to bed
9160230 i like to keep things as consistent for the players as i can
9160231 i want to let them have a place that they can get away with mom and dad uncle charlie and everybody else coming over they can get to the hotel and focus on their job
9160232 i realize that nobody but the player understands what its like to be a player all those people love them but they look at this as a game and for the players this is a business i want them to get off their feet you dont want to peak too soon the whole week youre trying to perfect your peak
9160233 sometimes during the week im doing a few different things and i use saturday to go through it just one more time
9160234 i put the college games on ive got my projector where i go through all my film and i just start going back through things
9160235 ill also sneak home that day especially if one of the kids has a game my wife goes on the road with me
9160236 the thing i remember most about that day is reggie brown having a good game with a long run you dont like that stuff but that one doesnt stick out as being that big of a thing
9160237 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9160238 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9160239 seconde chance est pour nous un d fi un programme que nous voulons f d rateur une pause dapr s midi une pause avant le journal t l vis pour un public pas n cessairement la m nag re qui veut avoir 25 minutes de plaisir

9160243 the mri showed he has a pectoral tear and he will be operated on on monday afternoon and he will be out for between 18 and 22 weeks
9160244 from our point of view he will be back for the start of next season which is important for us but its sad for him and the new zealand test side
9160245 we just wanted to make some adjustments there we are using these games to work on our combinations of john sutton and craig wing and halfback chris sandow and isaac luke
9160246 i started the game with wingy at hooker which we havent done since hes been at the club and i thought it worked really well
9160247 we brought isaac off the bench a bit fresher it was just a bit of my having a look at the best combination going forward
9160248 we are using these games to learn a lot over the last few weeks we knew we werent going to be in the semi finals
9160249 but were playing the best teams in the competition and were not turning up and just going through the motions because were going out there and really ripping into them
9160250 she knows when to stand up and doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9160251 i have a dream where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands
9160252 the us claims that the missile defense system pa pundits the relentless pursuit of common sense submitted by grumpyoldman
9160253 i certainly thought our group responded bigtime from our performance against st kilda inside 50m entries were 57 so weve gone from 37 to 57 so hopefully that will continue
9160254 western bulldogs were a bit better than us early and until we adjusted to the wet conditions it looked like wed be in a bit of trouble but once we did that the fight of our playing group was just fantastic
9160255 both teams made a lot of mistakes which was expected in the wet and maybe just at crucial times they had a little more poise than we did at certain stages
9160256 it was the sort of game that was great for us going into the finals against a very competitive side and we certainly thought we held our own
9160257 our bowlers bowled well and we fielded well also but we didnt bat well
9160258 it was hard at the start there was a little bit of swing

9160288 i saw a villager tightly clutching a branch and a snake hanging from another branch of tree nearly half submerged in the floodwater while fleeing my village
9160289 these are some of the worst floods in generations and they present a huge challenge for governments and humanitarian organizations
9160290 it is critical that we get emergency assistance to these people in the coming days
9160291 i sold my goat for just 50 rupees which on any other day could have brought me 2 000 rupees
9160292 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9160293 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9160294 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9160295 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall

9160300 die europ er messen design und den emotionen die ein produkt weckt traditionell mehr bedeutung zu als unsere kunden in korea deswegen sind wir mit unseren produkten f r europa perfekt aufgestellt
9160301 iriver konzentriert sich auf die zielgruppe der jungen und junggebliebenen die verbraucher also die von ihren multimediager ten immer mehr funktionalit ten erwarten aber dennoch auch auf ein einfach zu bedienendes und stylisches ger t wert legen die designpreise die iriver ber die jahre erhalten hat beweisen uns dass wir richtig liegen

9160304 wenn die spekulation so effizient w re h tten die spekulanten in den 80er jahren auch spekulieren k nnen und h tten die preise nach oben gebracht und das hat nicht funktioniert
9160305 heute haben wir eine steigerung der nachfrage es gibt derzeit kein reserven problem es ist nur ein engpass in der produktion
9160306 bisher haben wir es geschafft diese produktion zu erh hen aber wir sehen einen engpass und eine begrenzung dieser produktion
9160307 das ist nicht gesund f r unsere gesellschaft f r unsere wirtschaft und auch f r die entwicklungsl nder sind so hohe preise sehr problematisch
9160308 alles kurzfristige reaktionen die an der gesamtsache gar nichts ndern

9160312 wir verkaufen europaweit in nahezu allen produktkategorien eine im hinblick auf energieeffizienz und klimaschutz bessere sortimentsstruktur als der marktdurchschnitt
9160313 hausger te sind eine der wenigen m glichkeiten wie die privaten haushalte mit berschaubaren investitionen etwas gegen die steigenden energiepreise unternehmen k nnen
9160314 energiesparen ist kein vor bergehendes modethema sondern ein wirklich langfristiger megatrend
9160315 wir stehen am beginn eines gro en wirtschaftlichen wandels vielleicht sogar einer dritten industriellen revolution als bsh sind wir fest entschlossen die notwendigen ver nderungen aktiv mitzugestalten
9160316 den aktivisten strafen anzudrohen weil sie ein naturschutzgebiet sch tzen und gleichzeitig hinzunehmen dass dasselbe gebiet durch fischerei sand und kiesabbau zerst rt wird ist absurd
9160317 bundesumweltminister sigmar gabriel muss den schutz der meere vor seiner haust r ernst nehmen nicht nur als deutscher umweltminister sondern auch als derzeitiger pr sident der konvention zur biologischen vielfalt hat er hier eine besondere verantwortung
9160318 als erste ma nahme zum schutz der gebiete muss umweltminister gabriel jetzt seine f r fischerei und kiesabbau zust ndigen kollegen an einen tisch holen und wirksame schutzma nahmen entwickeln
9160319 ja das war ein film eine literaturverfilmung der gr ne heinrich und mir hat das am anfang gar nicht so wahnsinnig viel spa gemacht weil es alles so fremd war und so neu und irgendwie irritierend und ich glaube das ist manchmal ein ganz wesentlicher aspekt dass so neues und befremdendes erst mal nicht so toll ist und dass man eigentlich erst wenn man etwas mehr mit den mitteln umgehen kann und es etwas besser versteht auch genie en kann und mittlerweile mache ich es fast lieber als theater
9160320 bei mir ging das los mit nichts bereuen und mit dem wei en rauschen und ich glaube beide filme waren nominiert oder haben auch den first step award gewonnen wenn ich mich richtig entsinne deshalb ist das ein ganz wichtiger preis f r mich gewesen und ich verfolge das auch nach wie vor weil ich als schauspieler nat rlich auch daran interessiert bin zu kucken mit wem ich in zukunft arbeiten werde
9160321 wie oft gibts filme die wirklich toll sind gerade vom nachwuchs der einfach leider untergeht aus was f r gr nden auch immer und deshalb finde ich es so toll dass da filme gerade so im anfang unterst tzt werden und denen geholfen werden dass die gesehen werden und dass sie auszeichnungen bekommen die dann doch viel bedeuten und eben dadurch weiter gef rdert werden das finde ich gro artig
9160322 alles was nicht so kompliziert ist weil ich hasse es diese ganzen bedienungsanleitungen zu lesen das h lt einfach immer alles wahnsinnig auf und ich mag einfach die sachen die man anmacht und die sachen erkl ren sich von selbst
9160323 ich finde technik ist ne tolle sache ich bertreibe es nicht also ich schreibe nach wie vor gerne per hand meine termine irgendwo auf und ich habe das lteste handy das man sich vorstellen kann mit dem man nur telefonieren und nicht fotografieren kann
9160324 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

9160330 just as we respect the right of married women to wear their wedding rings we also believe that similar treatment and respect must be accorded to hindu women wearing their dots
9160331 you address two problems these patients have one is that they dont know how to walk not walking they become deconditioned and lose cardiovascular fitness with the treadmill type of training you improve walking and also increase fitness
9160332 the most important clinical aspect of the study is that it is saying recovery can occur long after a stroke and can occur even after all the routine therapies have been tried scientifically the most important point appears to be that rewiring of the brain may be involved in this process not just body conditioning
9160333 should be part of standard treatment for every stroke survivor who has a walking habit
9160334 we saw what we call an equivalent of neuroplasticity a change in brain activation that reflects the brains adaptability
9160335 most physical therapy departments have treadmills but they dont use them to the extent that we used them in the study
9160336 because this is exhausting it should always be done under supervision
9160337 there is always the risk of running into heart problems and falling we used special treadmills with handrails and also monitored the heart rate to achieve the level of exertion we needed
9160338 it is promising that treadmill exercise can stimulate new or underused brain circuits and improve walking in stroke survivors even after completion of conventional rehabilitation therapy
9160339 the transfer is an effort to help secure state assets
9160340 markets may see higher levels in the week starting 1 sept 08 nifty can go upto 4 400 4 420 levels where market may face resistance on down side 4 300 can provide support

9160343 their destiny in the caucasus would definitely not be different than the dilemma they have in other regions where they have already created a crisis
9160344 we support peace and stability in the caucasus area and the crisis over there should be tackled within its own place
9160345 we however hope that wrong calculations and signals would not lead to renewed conflicts
9160346 porriott was a womanising conman whose modus operandi was unlike that of jack the ripper but this is a fascinating australian connection to jack the ripper which cannot be completely dismissed

9160348 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9160349 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9160350 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9160351 its not going to change its not a family show
9160352 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9160353 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9160354 the local distribution is almost nil the shops are closed and people don t come out to buy there is an interest burden also that is accumulating
9160355 his deepest condolences to those affected especially to the families of those who have been killed or who are missing
9160356 at a time like this it matters little how the floods started or who or what is at fault what is critical is urgent help to those in need
9160357 even at best of times south asia has many of the poorest in the world
9160358 these massive floods can wash away even the most basic hope that families have

9160375 india doesnt really have a band culture the promos look slick and the effort genuine if the film does well we might see more films on bands even if someone doesnt belong to a band or doesnt connect with rock music the idea of one man chasing his dream will have its appeal in colleges of most urban cities there are hundreds of youngsters who sometime or the other dream of forming their own band
9160376 one way of looking at rock on is that it is an underdog story which never goes wrong beyond male bonding and friendship theres the dream the soul searching and coming together of friends makes for an engaging story
9160377 arjun rampal purab and kenny made me feel we were actually making music
9160378 its hard to judge from the promos the exact theme of the movie by the looks of it its more about their personal lives than the band itself which should be interesting the movie looks pretty slick theres this common belief that with rock and roll comes sex and drugs most bands think that music gives them power to be rebellious and anti system we he and faisal just hope that rock on shows the viewer a bigger and brighter picture of how rock and roll can change the world and not just four guys coming together and making music
9160379 if the film is a hit more people will make movies about music bands if not you may not see a film like this for another two to three years
9160380 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot

9160387 the afp s announcement that hannef was innocent highlights yet again the inadequacy of the current haneef inquiry which is not a full blown properly constituted royal commission
9160388 there s been a lingering suspicion which has firmed up that the afp in maintaining the investigation against dr haneef for the last 12 months has really been engaged in a smoke screen back protection exercise and there s been no reason for dr haneef to be kept under investigation
9160389 what the inquiry should look at is how much money what resources has the afp used in the last 12 months and has there been a legitimate line of inquiry it has been following or has it simply been parroting that line as a back protection exercise

9160429 theres more passing in this offense than we traditionally had
9160430 i think tight end will probably be more of a factor and a lot more crossing patterns

9160494 the campaign has to go public to have an impact it has to become visible
9160495 we formed the committee in 1990 consisting of some lawyers and ex judges we found it impossible to expand or grow there was barely a lawyer willing to take a stand against judges or even to seek accountability so we had to go the people thats when the campaign came about
9160496 this was a case of a brazen and thoroughly corrupt judge and it was impossible to catch him impeachment doesnt work you cant get even 50 to 100 mps to sign up for an impeachment nobody wants to annoy the judges it is a case of loot and let loot

9160527 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need

9160634 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
9160635 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
9160636 whether that will happen again depends on where gustav hits and how hard it hits

9160647 we referred to it as our effort to de rust the rust belt

9160649 it took us some time to figure out what the voc measurements were for the industrial process we do then to understand what the best technology is to rectify it
9160650 it would have been wonderful if we had understood this perfectly
9160651 needed a much more intensive computer system that was focused on record keeping helping us catalog all our required data keeping track of all site renovations and also training and we have put that in place

9160688 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai
9160689 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9160690 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9160691 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9160692 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9160693 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9160694 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9160695 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9160696 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9160697 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9160698 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric
9160699 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9160700 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting

9160716 id rather be in the corner onstage it feels the safest
9160717 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9160718 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9160719 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9160720 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

9160726 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9160727 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9160728 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9160729 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9160730 early wlans focused on growing the number of access points to cover a given area but today many wireless administrators are focusing more attention on scaling capacity to address a surge in end users and the multimedia content they consume this is particularly being seen at universities supporting this involves everything from rethinking dns infrastructure to developing a deeper understanding of what access points can handle and 802 11n is no silver bullet warn those building big wireless networks these scaling issues are becoming more and more apparent where lots of folks show up and you need to make things happen says the former it director for a big ivy league campus
9160731 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9160732 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9160733 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9160734 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9160735 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9160736 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9160737 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9160738 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9160739 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9160740 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9160741 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9160742 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9160743 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9160744 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9160745 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9160746 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9160747 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9160748 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9160749 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9160750 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9160751 who are open to doing something on the production side
9160752 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9160753 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9160754 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9160755 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9160756 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9160757 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9160758 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9160759 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9160760 seperti keluarga keluarga yang lain lah sudah siapin menu menunya
9160761 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9160762 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9160763 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9160764 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9160765 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9160766 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9160767 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9160768 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9160769 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9160770 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9160771 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9160772 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9160773 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9160774 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9160775 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9160776 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9160777 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9160778 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9160779 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9160780 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9160781 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9160782 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9160783 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9160784 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9160785 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9160786 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9160787 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9160788 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9160789 following the order of the union government secl has curtailed coal supplies to the private parties up to 30 percent to ensure reserves for the state run power plants that are reeling under severe coal crises

9160801 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9160802 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9160803 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

9160809 this really comes at a bad time as most european tour agents are starting to choose country packages for the year end festive season
9160810 we are concerned that media coverage of the protests may persuade tour agents to look at alternative destinations like bali or vietnam
9160811 we are working with the phuket hotels association in helping stranded tourists who get bigger hotel room discounts additional buses are being arranged for those who cannot wait to fly out of thailand via bangkok
9160812 i am not worried how the government deals with the protest or rounds up all the protesters but it must not make the mistake of declaring a state of emergency and curfew
9160813 that would be most disastrous for tourism and the economy as it would take a long time for them to come back
9160814 we have given extended late check outs for our stranded south korean and australian tourists
9160815 many have no choice but to stay on until the airport resumes operation
9160816 we have clear cut orders from the provincial government and the military to complete the operation until the militants are flushed out and the writ of the government is established
9160817 the death toll has risen to three in huili county a large number of houses have collapsed
9160818 no one no institution and no union will be allowed to sabotage the security of gazas citizens
9160819 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9160820 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9160821 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9160822 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9160823 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9160824 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9160825 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9160826 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9160827 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9160828 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9160829 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9160830 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9160831 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9160832 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9160833 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9160834 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9160835 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9160836 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9160837 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9160838 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9160839 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9160840 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9160841 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9160842 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9160843 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9160844 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9160845 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9160846 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9160847 we chose the boys and girls club because its a terrific organization in rochester
9160848 it gives kids who have an interest in culinary arts who wouldnt be granted an opportunity a chance to be taught by some of the best chefs in the region
9160849 it was kind of a dual thing where a cooking theme could be applied to a life lesson
9160850 like with being prepared how it applies to the kitchen and real life
9160851 it is fun because we learn different new tricks on how to make something better
9160852 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9160853 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9160854 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9160855 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9160856 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9160857 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9160858 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9160859 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9160860 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9160861 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9160862 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9160863 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9160864 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9160865 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9160866 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9160867 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9160868 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9160869 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9160870 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9160871 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9160872 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9160873 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9160874 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9160875 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9160876 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9160877 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9160878 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9160879 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9160880 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9160881 is it possible to live our lives without some belief about our creator
9160882 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9160883 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9160884 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9160885 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9160886 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9160887 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9160888 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9160889 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9160890 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9160891 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

9160907 thankfully its sorted out now although not as quickly as it should have been from the fans point of view
9160908 weve looked for 6 500 tickets from the georgian fa
9160909 the most important people to look after first are the 1 000 ireland supporters we expected to be in georgia theyre the people who follow us everywhere
9160910 it wasnt an easy decision obviously missing the cut last week and being put in a situation where i had to make a decision do i go back to gleneagles or do i stay in america

9160912 i have played 14 events on the pga tour this year i wanted to play 15 to make sure i could keep my membership
9160913 yes there are six tournaments left after the tour championship two of which are in florida where i have a home but they are not on my schedule
9160914 if you look at my schedule for the second half of the season it is very complicated
9160915 there was a whole number of factors behind my decision i wanted to play next week as well because it will help my world ranking position and it will help me get into the tour championship which will also help my world ranking position
9160916 i feel like ive got a pretty good chin anyway

9160998 this really comes at a bad time as most european tour agents are starting to choose country packages for the year end festive season

9161001 i am not worried how the government deals with the protest or rounds up all the protesters but it must not make the mistake of declaring a state of emergency and curfew

9161103 having experienced getting married in the caribbean ourselves we appreciated that it can be very difficult to find anyone who caters for this kind of specialist area many couples would like the option of taking a large number of guests with them and perhaps having the kind of wedding they would have had here but in a caribbean setting and at a fraction of the cost but most holiday companies do not cater for this kind of wedding party

9161210 un brano scritto in occasione del memorial a questo grande musicista
9161211 sono molto critico nei miei confronti ho avuto molte dolcezze e complimenti in questi anni ma io la vedo con unaltra misura e mi chiedo perch tutto questo per me cerco un rapporto con il pubblico cerco di capire i suoi desideri i gusti e con il gruppo cerchiamo di indovinare chi abbiamo di fronte quali potranno essere le loro reazioni da qui la scelta dei brani da eseguire durante la serata e poi c il piacere di suonare con i musicisti che mi accompagnano sul palcoscenico
9161212 li ammiro molto fanno dei grandi sacrifici sapendo che non lavoreranno mai come ti dicevo una professione molto difficile anche perch non si mai creata una categoria che possa ascoltare la musica oggi si ascolta una determintato genere di musica che personalmente non amo ma se ci fosse uno studio per lascolto ci sarebbe anche un cambio di direzione del mercato musicale

9161214 yes but if their stuck they wont be showing true thermal limits and although the false value is within limits the real value may not be
9161215 what may come out of that examination is that you have six different units operating around the state under a different set of standards
9161216 and the question that may come out of that is should there be a standard set of training that each sou special operations unit member needs to meet in order to be a team member i think thats a positive first step
9161217 he was an on duty individual that responded to back up the people that were there
9161218 he really shouldnt have been involved in it at all he was just there as perimeter coverage
9161219 im sorry that we werent able to succeed in accomplishing what our goal was which was keeping baseball here in nashua
9161220 i think stabile is belly aching because he is down in the housing industry
9161221 it is the same story every year and you know what john i am sorry sales are down i think it is great that the community has a baseball team but if you dont want it sell it we will get along fine
9161222 this is not a city that supports this type of venue
9161223 in other cities and small towns the team would be embraced as opposed to nashua where it is barely noticed
9161224 young professionals are part of the crowd that would attend those games
9161225 this city needs to figure out what its mission is
9161226 there are so many things that work in other cities that dont work here
9161227 id rather have something in there than have an empty stadium because i dont want all the riff raff
9161228 i think that nashua benefits from having a professional ball team in the community
9161229 it provides such a great opportunity for families and others to come together
9161230 my goal is to try to keep something in that beautiful stadium
9161231 its a good location and although attendance has been down its been a good organization for the league
9161232 however its not as if theres somebody out there ready to pounce weve got about a month to do something
9161233 certainly if something were brewing on the stove bubbling away we could say lets wait a little longer
9161234 they called and said what about nashua its still preliminary
9161235 thats the biggest negative for it but its a good ballpark a lot of good history a lot of good things the night i was there a friday in june there were 2 000 people there everyone was having fun this year the weather was a factor its hurt everybody even us in quebec
9161236 if somebody said we need to see if this could work then we might do that require just one year
9161237 you have to wonder arent there five people in this community who have 200 000 to put into it

9161466 bumper stickers and fridge magnets remind us that life is not a rehearsal we encourage one another towards the secular modern heaven of self fulfillment the development of the personality the relationships which help define us the status giving job the material goods the ownership of property the foreign holidays the acqu is ition of savings the accumulation of sexual exploits the visits to the gym the consumption of culture it all adds up to happiness doesnt it doesnt it this is our chosen myth and almost as much of a delusion as the myth that insisted on fulfillment and rapture when the last trump sounded and the graves were flung open when the healed and perfected souls joined in the community of saints and angels but if life is viewed as a rehearsal or a preparation or an anteroom or whichever metaphor we choose but at any rate as something contingent something dependent on a greater reality elsewhere then it becomes at the same time less valuable and more serious those parts of the world where religion has drained away and there is a general acknowledgment that this short stretch of time is all we have are not on the whole more serious places than those where heads are still jerked by the cathedrals bell or the minarets muezzin on the whole they yield to a frenetic materialism although the ingenious human animal is well capable of constructing civilizations where religion coexists with frenetic materialism where the former might even be an emetic consequence of the latter witness america
9161467 the best frame of mind in which to conduct life
9161468 our only defence against death or rather against the danger of not being able to think about anything else lies in the acquisition of worthwhile short term worries
9161469 this is a technique i myself tend to use if youre a writer on deadline you dont really have time to think about being dead
9161470 who will mourn and miss you or those who might hear of your death and raise a momentary glass or even those who might say good or never liked him anyway or terribly overrated rather
9161471 from the point of view of those who have never heard of you which is after all almost everybody unknown person dies not many mourn that is our certain obituary in the eyes of the rest of the world
9161472 would you rather die in the pain of being wrenched away from those you have long loved or would you rather die when your emotional life has run its course when you gaze out at the world with indifference both towards others and towards yourself

9161480 caught up in the complex web of intrigue masterminded by william stephenson the legendary canadian spymaster who outmaneuvered the state department and managed to create an elaborate clandestine organization whose purpose was to weaken the isolationist forces in america and influence u s policy in favor of britain
9161481 tall handsome and intelligent dahl had all the makings of an ideal operative a courageous officer wounded in battle smashing looking in his dress uniform he was everything england could have asked for as a romantic representative of their imperiled island he was also arrogant idiosyncratic and incorrigible and probably the last person anyone would have considered reliable enough to be trusted with anything secret above all however dahl was a survivor when he got into trouble he was shrewd enough to make himself useful to british intelligence providing them with gossipy items that proved he had a nose for scandal and the writers ear for damning detail already attached to the british air mission in washington he came equipped with the perfect cover story and his easy wit and conspicuous charm guaranteed him entr e to the drawing rooms and bedrooms of the rich and powerful

9161487 met marsh at a party and immediately hit it off with the colorful millionaire who was an exemplary host and an amusing and informative guide to washingtons stratified society where new and old money the congressional set and the diplomatic corps all jostled for recognition
9161488 was an active voice in american politics and an influential behind the scenes figure in washington but unlike most of the players dahl had encountered in the nations capital he eschewed publicity in print preferring to manipulate people and events from the privacy of his r street study
9161489 kept it two days and then handed it back when dahl asked if he liked the stories hemingway replied i didnt understand them and then strode down the corridor without looking back

9161509 the new royalty rates are so high and increasing in the next three years the vast majority pay 008 us cents per song per listener
9161510 a lot of these stations wont make it under the current royalty system
9161511 the board essentially ignored webcasters suggestions and went with a much higher rate
9161512 were hopeful that there will be some action in the new congress next year
9161513 there already has been progress made but its a slow process
9161514 it works really nicely and theyre in the process of launching new features of that product that do it a little differently its kind of a visual representation of what you like and dont like i think theyre going to have a big hit with it
9161515 traditional media need to be focused on internet opportunities just like newspapers going online
9161516 one is whats the model is it a subscription model or advertising model i think subscription models work for a limited amount of listeners but if its going to be mainstream and widely used it needs to be free and ad supported
9161517 if youre a local business that wants to advertise on wfan a new york based all sports station you can do it
9161518 they may buy the zip codes and market to the ones they want i may have a sports bar in l a that wants to reach people interested in sports in in the l a area theyll buy only the listeners who are listening to wfan in l a its a very powerful local medium and and you have to be careful youre not buying the entire station but the local portion of that station
9161519 what it means is you can now put internet radio on your iphone that means you can have internet radio wherever you go i think its highly favorable in terms of revenue growth
9161520 pandora said in the last month that their growth rate was up nearly 40 percent merely because of the iphone
9161521 when you sign up for an account youre putting several data points in there and its all very rich from a targeting perspective
9161522 you can reach people who are listening online the ability to have an audio ad is compelling on online radio because it cuts through the visual noise the people are there listening to music you can reach them in a way you wouldnt have in any other situation
9161523 the opportunity with a pandora is to take all your listeners and be able to target down to the zip code for your in stream audio ads and target different genres people listen to
9161524 i think the growth induced now by the iphone will help them pay that
9161525 secondly i think the growth induced by the iphone will make the labels more willing to accommodate reductions in royalties
9161526 its a great opportunity to listen to internet radio wherever you are
9161527 this is a 20 billion per year business and a big slice of that ad pie will come from mobile radio

9161541 not had the benefit of growing in a wonderful multicultural environment as that in fiji and were becoming less and less familiar with their roots
9161542 in another multicultural environment in australia where we live now i noticed that my grandchildren were increasing forgetting their parents were from fiji and had familial linkages with india and specifically gujarat
9161543 they were more and more confused because my wife and i spoke in gujarati my two children spoke in fiji hindi and in english and my son in law spoke english fijian and rotuman
9161544 i know the players have a lot of pride in how they perform
9161545 a bit of confidence going into the pre season if we can win the last two games of the year after thrashing wooden spooner melbourne last week then it gives the players something as they are running around the ovals in the summer
9161546 theyll know we do have a good team and we have beaten a quality team
9161547 if we can take that into the pre season that will be a huge bonus for us
9161548 we have had a lot of players if you look back to last year who have dropped a little bit or break even with their performances from last year
9161549 we have not had too many improve that is certainly one big disappointment for the club this year
9161550 adam simpson their captain drives a lot of their stoppage work he is super smart they have a lot of tricks very good players around that area and they can pull out any of those tricks at any time
9161551 we played them seven weeks ago it is pretty fresh in our minds how they play
9161552 we match up quite well against them we understand their match style and we think we have plans in place to beat that they have a lot of bigger guys were going to have to play pretty physical
9161553 were going to have to match them in that area certainly around our stoppages were going to have to be on our game to beat them and give our forwards first use of the footy

9161559 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
9161560 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9161561 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
9161562 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
9161563 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
9161564 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
9161565 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
9161566 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
9161567 if something like this had happened to the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple

9161584 foods under attack from two quarters its under attack from the food industry which is taking you know perfectly good whole foods and tricking them up into highly processed edible food like substances and from nutritional science which has over the years convinced us that we shouldnt be paying attention to food its really the nutrients that matter
9161585 and theyre trying to replace foods with antioxidants you know cholesterol saturated fat omega 3s and that whole way of looking at food as a collection of nutrients i think is very destructive
9161586 its a literary scientific experience now going shopping in the supermarket because basically the food has gotten more complex
9161587 nutritionism is the prevailing ideology in the whole world of food and its not a science it is an ideology and like most ideologies it is a set of assumptions about how the world works that were totally unaware of and nutritionism theres a few fundamental tenets to it one is that food is a collection of nutrients that basically the sum of you know food is the sum of the nutrients it contains the other is that since the nutrient is the key unit and as ordinary people we cant see or taste or feel nutrients we need experts to help us design our foods and tell us how to eat another assumption of nutritionism is that you can measure these nutrients and you know what theyre doing that we know what cholesterol is and what it does in our body or what an antioxidant is and thats a dubious proposition and the last premise of nutritionism is that the whole point of eating is to advance your physical health and that thats what we go to the store for thats what were buying and thats also a very dubious idea if you go around the world people eat for a great many reasons besides you know the medicinal reason i mean they eat for pleasure they eat for community and family and identity and all these things but weve put that aside with this obsession with nutrition and i basically think its a pernicious ideology i mean i dont think its really helping us if there was a trade off if looking at food this way made us so much healthier great but in fact since weve been looking at food this way our health has gotten worse and worse
9161588 okay but what should i eat and now that youve been to the feedlots the food processing plants the organic factory farms and the local farms and ranches what do you eat

9161600 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market

9161604 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
9161605 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
9161606 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
9161607 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases
9161608 we are very far from treatment but this is a big step
9161609 the relaxed group dont let email exert any pressure on their lives
9161610 they treat it exactly the way that one would treat the mail ill fetch it ill deal with it in my own time
9161611 the second group felt driven to keep on top of email but also felt that they could cope with it the third group however reacted negatively to the pressure of email
9161612 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
9161613 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
9161614 the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure
9161615 the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
9161616 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria

9161619 walk away i get the feeling this isnt going to play out in your favor the risk that her boyfriend is still in the picture is too great
9161620 the world is so unfair to me this is a personal slam on me and there is an evil plot conspiring against me to cause this to happen
9161621 calm down this sort of thing happens all the time and with a system as large as the cta its bound to happen to you why not walk to work today
9161622 the odds of me talking this guy into letting me on are slim if i yell at him it wont work hes pretty big so i probably cant take him right here why not walk to work today

9161673 we are keen to explore whether this was linked to some chinese organised crime groups targeting foreign students or young people in the uk
9161674 while we have to keep an open mind as to what the motive was we are looking at the targeting of young people possibly for monetary gain or robbery

9161700 we survived two world wars and the great depression its unfortunate we couldnt survive this
9161701 weve made due with what is left it has been dwindling though
9161702 ive always lived in st jacques and i wanted to help the community in any way i could
9161703 it doesnt happen every day but sometimes people visiting will want to look at old church records for one reason or another
9161704 just recently a lady from port aux basques visiting wanted to obtain some information about her fathers sister who married here years ago she only knew that her name was julia and sure enough we found the information she was looking for by searching the church documents here which go back as far as 1904
9161705 shortly after i was baptized my godmother decided to add the letters ie to burns and thats how the name burnsie came about
9161706 my father became crippled from a leg injury during the last few years of his life and couldnt work as often as the other men
9161707 he died when i was three and mom was left with five children in a very difficult time in newfoundland history the great depression years very few families were well to do in those days but we were not as well off as most times were tougher than usual if you lost a parent
9161708 some people suggested to mom that she should put us in an orphanage but she wouldnt hear tell of that she worked at any job she could get to help us survive
9161709 because of moms hard work we always had enough bread to eat and she grew her own vegetables so there was always enough food around
9161710 mr fudge built a new home for us and he and mom had two children of their own
9161711 immediately after leaving school i went to work for the young family in st jacques to look after an invalid mother
9161712 the young family came over from england and was one of the more prosperous families in the community as they owned several fishing schooners i worked for the youngs for three years and 10 months for 6 a month or about 20 cents a day
9161713 after working for the young family for nearly four years edgar dyett offered me a job at his store for 30 a month that was a fair amount of money back then and i jumped at the opportunity
9161714 i met thomas lawrence in 1952 as he had bought a house in st jacques his sister was already living here so tom decided to move here with his widowed mother as well he was fishing out of lunenburg at that time
9161715 after a brief courtship we married in 1953 and settled down here in st jacques tom was a wonderful husband and a great provider i never wanted for anything after i married as he was a very hard worker
9161716 mr bullen was 80 when tom arrived to live in st jacques
9161717 his wife and children had passed away and he had no family of his own so out of charity tom brought him here with him so when we married he was living with us
9161718 mr bullen was good to take care of he loved children and was great to the family he never complained about anything and we just came to consider him as one of the family some people said that i should have put him in an old folks home but he was one of the family and we just couldnt bring ourselves to do that he died at the age of 101 he had no medical records upon his death because he had never been to a doctor in his life
9161719 people used to ask me how can you look after two elderly people in addition to raising your family i didnt think it was a challenge then
9161720 i just felt it was my duty something that i was expected to do and i did it
9161721 my daughter ruby passed away in 1976 when she was just five years old
9161722 she was diagnosed with aplastic anemia which is a blood disorder similar to leukemia we had gone to toronto with her to see doctors who told us that her condition was too late for a bone marrow transplant my daughter hazel was ready to donate bone marrow but it was too late and wouldnt work
9161723 ruby was diagnosed with her condition in january 1976 and she died in july of that year the doctors told us at that time that children in the future would not die of the disease and apparently many if not all survive the condition today
9161724 he had surgery for the cancer but it didnt work in his case in spite of the suffering though he wanted to go back to work the doctors said it was ok for him to go back to sea but three weeks after his last trip he passed away he was 57 years old
9161725 the pain is still there to this day ive never really gotten over it my children were and remain a great support to me and have helped me tremendously in getting by since 1988
9161726 i had gone to grand falls windsor for a routine mammogram as i had turned 60
9161727 the procedure detected a lump in my breast which was diagnosed as cancerous i cried a bucket of tears upon hearing the news
9161728 however following a mastectomy shortly after my diagnosis the cancer has not returned and 15 years later im doing fine
9161729 a lot of the family names that i grew up with are no longer here
9161730 im the last member of the skinner family here and there are still members of the hickey evans and lawrence families here
9161731 however such family names as burkes young dinhams piercey and dawe are gone now of course the number of children here now is down from what it was in my day i can remember when there were at least 30 children in this little section of the community around where i live i doubt if there are 30 children in the entire community today
9161732 i enjoy my card games and bingo games today and im still an active member of the community
9161733 of course my children are a great comfort to me
9161734 if you could choose only one movie to see in the theater in the next four months which film would be your first choice
9161735 we are surprised by overwhelming buzz for twilight as the film to beat for the fall
9161736 among all upcoming movies twilight has consistently ranked among our top 3 most requested titles the other two are harry potter and watchmen much of the anticipation has to do with the blockbuster novel and moviegoers looking for a great fantasy in the fall it appears to have a wide appeal as parents are also looking for a film they can enjoy along with their teenagers

9161738 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness
9161739 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9161740 amy winehouse should have arrived on the site early friday evening we were told by her agent at 8 00 pm that she wasnt coming
9161741 the energy and excitement surrounding the 2010 games has been building in whistler for years but it took a noticeable jump during the beijing olympics because we know were next
9161742 all the hard work and effort put in by the whistler community the resort municipality of whistler whistler blackcomb vanoc staff in whistler hotels restaurants and other tourism operators have put us in the position to walk onto the world stage confident that people who come here before and during the games will have a memorable experience immersed in the spirit and the pulse of the 2010 winter games in a beautiful mountain winter setting
9161743 in creating this new department the mountain sports team is working to build a comprehensive mountain sports program
9161744 with cbmr bringing in these programs and opportunities for the community our mountain sports team will have some of the industries top coaches like woody lindenemeyr to run the big mountain side and christian robertson to run the snowboarding program
9161745 having this team together and so involved in the program along with our improved mountain resource plan we are really expecting some great success and support
9161746 this is a new concept for us and we are excited about the renewed commitment toward competitive sports and ski clubs
9161747 that wvas alpine program provides the depth to staff ratio and the customized competition schedules demanded of elite fis level j1 j2 athletes
9161748 it not only strengthens our full time alpine ussa fis level j1 j2 program and our ability to attract top level alpine racers but it also provide us with a means to create a very strong j3 development program under the leadership of seasoned wvbbts head j3 alpine coach and executive director of athletes tom barbeau a former canadian national team coach and ussa eastern alpine and nhara coach of the year
9161749 the synergy in establishing this program ran both ways partnering with new hampton school enables us to offer wva students looking for the traditional nine month college preparatory school setting to attend nhs full time while continuing to reap the benefits of our full time alpine training experience
9161750 alpine athletes will attend nhs classes in the morning and receive full time on snow training and dryland conditioning in the afternoons mid week along with weekend training in waterville valley
9161751 lifeinlines is a chronicle of your life which is created as and when you live its a chronicle because its a collection of little moments in your life that get lost in the blah of ongoing life some of these moments are that you want to eternalize some of these are moments that you want to share with your friends and vice versa none of the existing social networking sites offer this facility of actually recording and capturing your lifes little moments
9161752 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come to a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently at the international gateway to southern california
9161753 hes due to arrive in england on saturday but as a free agent he is not under pressure to sign before the transfer window closes so we will evaluate all the options open to him
9161754 however at this stage in his career he wants to play in the premier league and we are hopeful he will end up there
9161755 if you look at the bench last week and the one at west ham undoubtedly it is a stronger squad than last season
9161756 it is difficult for people like kevin kilbane and michael brown who have been fantastic for me all last year when i came here but are not getting games at the moment
9161757 ive had to make a call and that is the difficult part of management because we you need a big squad thats the way the premier league is because after monday thats it you have to go to battle with what youve got for four months
9161758 theres a good spirit of course but id be lying if i said there wasnt a few disappointed and rightly so if they are happy sitting on the bench next to me then there is something wrong with them
9161759 so you want them to come and knock on the door to be angry and show that they are desperate to get back in the side certainly kilbane and brown are two that absolutely fit into that mould
9161760 you never know what might happen you can never say never but i expect things to be quiet
9161761 so todd and sarah are scratching their heads saying why is this guy representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know so from their perspective everybodys protecting him audi probably disagrees with me walt monegan does and i understand its really touchy but i just want you to understand that cops that use excessive force or go out of the lines they just have no tolerance because theyve seen the facts personally

9161779 our attention was quickly drawn to the mound by the local people who showed us hundreds of artefacts and statuettes of stone stucco and terracotta that they had collected for generations these precious relics adorn homes libraries schools and other buildings in the village
9161780 this is interesting because in the other monasteries even those at gaya stucco designs are only in the sanctum sanctorum but here the entire monastery has stucco decorations all over this is not all we have excavated the eastern flank of the monastery and were amazed to find that the length of one side is 61 metres comparable with the largest in the country
9161781 what has excited us most is the discovery of a rare buddha stone sculpture from stratified context representing the buddha in the well known bhumisparshamudra two stone heads presumably of the buddha have also been found but we are waiting for ratification so have a large number of terracotta seals

9161793 gt retired lincoln pastor carroll richards gets his moment in the flash gun in this 2004 photograph with barack obama richards whose son worked on obamas campaign for u s senate was attending an obama function and video shoot in carlinville where the picture was taken
9161794 during the course of his involvement i was asked to be an extra in a commercial shoot for obama
9161795 all i can assume is i was just sort of every man
9161796 i said yes and ive decided that if hes going to go by rocket that i should go by the name rocket launcher
9161797 he laughed all over himself and the cameras were going and there was a still photographer around that particular clip it doesnt show me full faced but they loved that clip and it appeared in commercials immediately
9161798 so thurday night im watching the movie being shown in coverage of the convention and first came up the picture of edith and im thrilled
9161799 then 10 seconds before the end they showed the rocket launcher clip
9161800 in his speech he even had a line about how those downstate people remind him of his grandparents and i know for a fact that he made the very same observation about edith awick
9161801 obama came in and talked to her for quite some time
9161802 you always wonder when you meet these people if youre just like a passing billboard or that sort of thing
9161803 but he commented to my son even afterwards that awick reminded him of his grandmother
9161804 it undercuts one of the points they are making that she is an ethical reformer
9161805 governor palin has been fully cooperative in this situation and has nothing to hide she has been a leader and proven reformer demanding accountability and transparency from alaskas government which resulted in landmark ethics legislation
9161806 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment

9161808 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9161809 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability

9161827 and while its great to have my first title be not only a critically acclaimed one but also a financial success there is a bigger picture at play here that we need to look at consumers voted with their dollars they basically have sent the message loud and clear we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy

9161922 its very different from in the past when you had a low year and you tended to rebound we havent been doing that anymore
9161923 i guess the main thing people should understand is this is just a continuation of that long term downward trend i think whether or not we break the record its just the continuation of what weve been seeing since 2002 where every year were losing ice and were not recovering at all
9161924 you had a lot of things that happened together that caused a lot of ice loss
9161925 but had that perfect storm happened say in the 1970s you probably wouldnt have lost so much ice like you did last year and the key thing seems to be the ice is just becoming really thin and its that much more vulnerable to natural variability
9161926 its scary its such a huge change thats happening very quickly and it makes me very sad because i just cant see how the species that rely on the ice can survive this

9161970 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9161971 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo

9162005 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9162006 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9162017 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
9162018 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9162019 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9162020 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9162021 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9162022 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
9162023 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
9162024 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche

9162027 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9162028 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9162029 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9162030 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9162031 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9162032 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9162033 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9162034 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9162056 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

9162058 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9162059 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

9162069 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9162070 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9162071 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9162072 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9162073 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9162156 our mechanics had to change the engine to ensure that we could keep our vehicles rolling

9162223 the selection of a vice presidential candidate is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make john mccains selection of sarah palin raises serious questions about his judgment why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and continuing george bushs failed economic policies john mccain and sarah palin will not bring the american people the new direction they need
9162224 hope its palin i would vote twice just to stick it to obama
9162225 im actually very excited that women will get some serious respect in this race
9162226 hoo ray fu k the dnc fu k obama they are so fu k up they brushed off the women base like dirt and the gop pick them up go mccain
9162227 omg buuuuurn obama buuuurn what a slap in the face if its palin i will put blood and sweat into campaigning for that team
9162228 leave it to the gop to pick a woman for the ticket obama snubbed the most viable and experienced woman who received 18 million votes for another male i have a feeling somewhere somehow hillary is snickering
9162229 she has five kids trust me she knows how to run things
9162230 thats it for me i will be voting mccain palin a republican team for the very first time in my life yeow how my life has changed this year
9162231 so much for mccain being against womens rights and equal pay
9162232 they keep making this mistake again and again the more they trash this woman the more she will get hillarys vote
9162233 no surprise cnns treatment of hillary clinton tells you exactly what they think about women who seek power shame on them
9162234 i have had it my party used roe v wade to try to keep us all loyal to the party
9162235 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
9162236 obama has said a lot of stuff but nothing with a concrete vision
9162237 bringen sie ihre freunde ganz gro raus melden sie ihre beste freundin oder ihren besten freund f r die neue show von sonja zietlow und dirk bach an wir brauchen nur ein paar informationen und ihre verschwiegenheit

9162246 t he vision of mind that has captured the imagination of philosophers cognitive scientists economists and political scientists since the eighteenth century a dispassionate mind that makes decisions by weighing the evidence and reasoning to the most valid conclusions bears no relation to how the mind and brain actually work
9162247 when campaign strategists start from this vision of mind their candidates typically lose
9162248 it is not about depending or not depending on a few players of course it is an achievement but you cant just sit back on it and say we won the twenty20 world cup the tri series in australia or now here in sri lanka you have to continue doing it
9162249 if you have players like sachin and sehwag it really helps in doing and achieving these things consistently but it their absence is not really in control because at times you will have injuries
9162250 we didnt have ishant sharma we didnt have sachin and veeru sehwag who was in prime form but it is up to other individuals to take up the responsibility because there is no point in sitting and sulking about guys who are not there
9162251 they are the guys who are part of the 16 who can really make a difference and they were doing just that
9162252 but of course you miss individuals especially the great players
9162253 in the middle it is very important to rotate strike and we have been able to do that we have got the partnerships we have played the spinners well we negotiated muttiah murali tharan well i think we played him really well it has been tough over the years to play murali in sri lanka i think we tackled ajantha mendis quite well too
9162254 overall i was quite impressed by the way we performed from the 20th till the 40th over of course in some games we lost wickets and you are really not in a position to do anything but that is part and parcel of the game
9162255 i really enjoyed the break and the main thing is i was enjoying the practice session more and it sets a good trend
9162256 you have to give 100 per cent there as well you just can not bat for 20 minutes and go under the shade when you feel from inside to go under the shade that is the time when you realise your body needs a bit of rest
9162257 i was happy to get some rest thanks to the selectors and the bcci when i came back here i really enjoyed the couple of sessions that i had in bangalore they were tough it was skill related and i really enjoyed the sessions i was doing the keeping and batting and also enjoyed fielding

9162470 most of the time i have no idea where a piece is going to go or what its going to end up as
9162471 i dont trust the idea of forcing something i want to find ideas organically i find an entry point like an edge of a landscape element and just add things and sometimes subtract things its like an adventure discovering stuff in the process

9162475 i offered those women free prenatal checkups and a free birth and then i told them they could wring the childs neck themselves

9162481 can it wait lieutenant jefferson im trying to deactivate this bomb
9162482 major sir thats not a bomb thats a turkey sir
9162483 a turkey good lord lieutenant who would plant a bomb inside a turkey
9162484 no major i mean thats only a turkey the bomb is over there next to the device that looks like an alarm clock
9162485 lieutenant i swear if youre wrong ill have you cleaning toilets until youre so high from the fumes that youll need a parachute to get back down
9162486 lieutenant look at this timer theres only 100 seconds before this bomb goes off
9162487 sir thats not a timer sir thats a meat thermometer the internal core temperature is slowly dropping but i can say with absolute certainty that the turkey wont explode with all due respect sir i suggest we call in a bomb disposal unit
9162488 i have a better idea lieutenant jefferson fire up the stargate
9162489 sir ive established a stable connection with an uninhabited planet
9162490 you sent the turkey millions of lightyears from here but the bomb is still here and i think its about to explode
9162491 lieutenant i was just about to eat the lunch i ordered the cook says he had it delivered it here from the mess hall have you seen a turkey anywhere
9162492 general the meat thermometer showed that it was undercooked the lieutenant and i agreed that sending it to another planet would be the best course of action to keep you safe and we sent the turkey to where it couldnt harm anyone
9162493 lieutenant jefferson i think i see a promotion coming your way
9162494 sir i was in the immediate vicinity of the turkey which was about 100 degrees fahrenheit at the time when we disposed of it general
9162495 i see well why dont you hit the showers then you and the major report to my office in one hour for a debriefing
9162496 i have found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracy someone who has fought corruption and the failed policies of the past someone with executive experience who has shown great tenacity
9162497 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9162498 i know that it will demand the best i have to give and i promise nothing less
9162499 but politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9162500 the people of america expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reason the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good
9162501 i knew it would be the the republican party who would be the first to have a woman working at 1600 pennsylvania avenue
9162502 there is no question the obama campaign is hurting from this
9162503 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9162504 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9162505 being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
9162506 i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9162507 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9162508 the excitement was palpable among conservative leaders when they heard that gov palin was sen mccains choice for vice president
9162509 there is a high level of optimism among conservative leaders that the mccain palin combination is a ticket that will connect with values voters
9162510 with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment gov palin has electrified conservatives
9162511 will sunday be strange i am 100 per cent for villa thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
9162512 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 per cent for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
9162513 do i feel hung out to dry over what has happened
9162514 that is what the football business is all about i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules is there any ill feeling with martin oneill not at all
9162515 the manager knows i will be giving 100 per cent for himself and the club and that will be fine for everyone
9162516 its also nice hearing your team mates wanting you to stay we have got a great dressing room you want everyone to stay really but i would have been disappointed if they wanted me to leave
9162517 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
9162518 if it was me i wouldnt do it in the first place i would play it doesnt give out a great message but it makes the boys work twice as hard for each other
9162519 if i was in the same situation i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise ill always give 100 per cent wherever i am if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game all the time
9162520 it surprised me because i thought he would be back in the squad but we back the manager 100 per cent everyone has to work for each other
9162521 it hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country from the supporters point of view theres always two sides to the story though we need everyone to be pulling in the right direction
9162522 if he was fit and said he didnt want to play id be disappointed hes a spurs player so you expect him to give 100 per cent
9162523 im sure hell have the whole package when he turns up at united
9162524 if he doesnt then with the players they have and the manager they have everyone knows what will happen

9162530 two gop strategists close to the mccain campaign said all indications pointed to palin
9162531 the countrys security is too important to be run by neophytes
9162532 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
9162533 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
9162534 sarah is a small town mayor running alaska as if its a small town
9162535 mccain is out of his mind he has no foreign policy experience and shell help because shes been fishing in canada
9162536 conservatives will be thrilled with this pick gov palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
9162537 governor palin is a terrific contrast to the all washington ticket of obama biden she is a wonderful contrast to biden and a truly outside the beltway pick
9162538 lived in and on alaska for the entirety of sarah palins tenure as governor
9162539 obama cant be president because he is too young an too inexperienced guess that line is out the window
9162540 a hotter and probably a smarter choice would have been coulter
9162541 im listening to her now and this may be churlish but that voice
9162542 im watching her talk in dayton palin is a terrible public speaker she makes bush look polished biden will clean her clock in a debate oh she just touted her experience as the commander of the alaska national guard shades of dan quayle
9162543 the democrats wont be whining about her not having enough experience
9162544 however the obama campaign just released a statement saying that she is not qualify to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
9162545 has she even been out of the country or to the lower 48
9162546 it takes time got everything to gel what people have to remember is that this a young side and a new one
9162547 since last season we have had a plenty of new faces two of our most experienced players stephen hughes and marco reich only came into the squad just before the season started
9162548 of course we will make mistakes but it is important we learn from them and i am sure we will do that
9162549 its much better to concentrate on what we do well and there have been positives this season
9162550 we know we did not play well against crewe we have to put that from our minds now and get on with the job of clinching another win
9162551 we have good young players in the squad and it is up to the experienced players to pass on their experience but most of our youngsters got the taste for first team football last season
9162552 the issue of sanctions is not something we dont care about

9162555 in der steiermark brauchen wir nicht warten auf das gratis kindergartenjahr da ist der gratis kindergarten bereits durchgesetzt
9162556 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
9162557 years ago when we protested a war people would weigh in against us saying my country right or wrong our answer absolutely my country right or wrong when right keep it right when wrong make it right sometimes loving your country demands you must tell the truth to power
9162558 its very different from in the past when you had a low year and you tended to rebound we havent been doing that anymore
9162559 i guess the main thing people should understand is this is just a continuation of that long term downward trend i think whether or not we break the record its just the continuation of what weve been seeing since 2002 where every year were losing ice and were not recovering at all
9162560 you had a lot of things that happened together that caused a lot of ice loss
9162561 but had that perfect storm happened say in the 1970s you probably wouldnt have lost so much ice like you did last year and the key thing seems to be the ice is just becoming really thin and its that much more vulnerable to natural variability
9162562 its scary its such a huge change thats happening very quickly and it makes me very sad because i just cant see how the species that rely on the ice can survive this
9162563 they are wrong about that this is an easily recognizable fact
9162564 the authorities are giving the people false assurances that using condoms for safe sex there can never be safe sex
9162565 thats why what we are campaigning to people is about fidelity to their partners and of course abstention from sexual intimacy
9162566 most earnestly and urgently appeal to the government of the republic of the philippines grp and to the central committee of the moro islamic liberation front milf to put an immediate stop to the fighting between their respective combatants to order them back to their barracks and headquarters to release captives and hostages and to arrive at an immediate ceasefire agreement
9162567 most earnestly and urgently to the philippine national police their cafgus and cvus as well as to the local milf security forces to restore order in the affected areas in north cotabato and lanao del norte including the contiguous cities of kidapawan and iligan respectively
9162568 to provide immediate assistance to the displaced residents and their damaged houses chapels and properties with special attention to the poor the sick the babies and the little children
9162569 to help make this earnest and urgent appeal heard accepted and answered throughout the region
9162570 we likewise strongly and urgently appeal to print and broadcast media to take utmost care in responding only to the facts and to avoid spreading disinformation incendiary comments and unconfirmed humors
9162571 to intensify sustained personal and communal prayer accompanied by self sacrifices to ask him for an enlightened use of reason for calmness and sobriety in emotions for compassion and forgiveness in hearts
9162572 for we believe that christian islamic and indigenous faiths put great emphasis on the power of sincere and constant prayer
9162573 i strongly suggest that you engage our youth and the children of your parish the school and the small christian communities and your family so that they become active subjects of the vocation month
9162574 the discovery birth development and care for vocations fall on the whole christian community during the month of september it is customary for us here in the diocese of digos to highlight the pastoral care of vocations
9162575 the celebration of the vocation month is a special time for me to remember all of you brother priests the deacons and the consecrated persons with joy and thanksgiving for the witness of your selfless love and dedication to the mission entrusted to us all through the church and the particular ecclesial communities we belong to
9162576 vocation month is for you and me a special time to celebrate and take pride in the awesome gift of the vocation to the priesthood and the consecrated life
9162577 we are all beneficiaries of a special divine predilection precisely because we are earthen vessels let us continue to be awed by the tremendous grace upon grace we all continue to receive from the father in heaven
9162578 we priests and consecrated persons in this local church realize and rededicate ourselves to the pursuit of holiness so that we become for all to behold a light of the world and a salt of the earth
9162579 such a life witness cannot but edify and impress those whom god is calling let our light shine
9162580 to be ever faithful to their calling in the church
9162581 nalipay sila kay naa ang simbahan miduyog kanila sa pagtabang sa mga children in conflict with the law children at risk ug lakip na ang ilang mga ginikanan they are happy because the church is also helping cicl children at risk including their parents
9162582 if the bass is finally to produce a headliner the instrument can have no better champion
9162583 is a practical beginning of networking among episcopal conferences as sending and receiving countries
9162584 to address migration issues answering the question such as what can the church do in the concrete to help incoming and outgoing migrants what government policies does the church agrees or disagrees with as helpful and not
9162585 coherence and partnership will surely be the fruit of sharing data about migration about legal and illegal migrants
9162586 to get the local churches involved the parish pastoral councils or their equivalents where such exist must be made aware of the realities of migrants to and from the parish
9162587 it is in this level that many of the pastoral and ethical concerns of migrants can be successfully addressed
9162588 and if they are interested they are so only envelopmentally i e for the migrants contribution to the church
9162589 since the problems of migrants can involve not only the families but also the communities
9162590 on the part of the philippines where before mother spain evangelized the filipinos through the spanish missionaries now is the time for the filipinos overseas filipino workers laity at that to evangelize mother spain
9162591 yet it seems this important lesson in branding has only just been learned by the new orthodox anglican movement when they set out to give a name to their inaugural meeting they chose a name that sounded positive inclusive and informative the global anglican future conference but all too soon it became known as gafcon amazingly managing to combine widely used terms for a mistake and deceit in one short word

9162706 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9162707 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

9162710 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9162711 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

9162718 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9162745 but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me
9162746 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
9162747 theyre all seriously worried that its georgia today and one of them tomorrow
9162748 poland and the us signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
9162749 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the us and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict
9162750 tried and failed just before leaving for europe on monday 7 july to seal a deal to place missiles in poland the state department said
9162751 the statements of some nato representatives that the maneuvers of the alliances ships in the black sea were planned a year ago are evidence that attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia were planned earlier maybe even last year
9162752 now that the conflict with south ossetia is exhausted there are nato vessels in the black sea what for and with what aim
9162753 i thought they would kill us i was very much afraid
9162754 georgian units are concentrated in the central part of the republic and are preparing for further actions
9162755 georgian special forces are setting up arms caches in order among other things to carry out provocations on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
9162756 doctors cant tell me how they died i was only told their bodies were picked up on the road by russian troops and delivered here to tskhinvali morgue but its very mysterious
9162757 other journalists have joined us here our friends from ap reuters france press and time are here now and we all see it as our duty to complete this
9162758 working conditions for journalists were terrible of all the war conflicts in the post soviet space and the balkans this was the worst time for journalists
9162759 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
9162760 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
9162761 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
9162762 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
9162763 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
9162764 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
9162765 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
9162766 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
9162767 this is not an easy choice but this is the only opportunity to preserve the lives of the people
9162768 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people

9162770 saakashvili doesnt go to the bathroom without calling the u s embassy
9162771 a fire broke out in the military store near the town of lozovaya we are taking steps to localise the blaze the size of which we are checking
9162772 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained
9162773 i made clear above all that i would have expected that we would talk about these questions in international organisations before unilateral recognition happened
9162774 there are several un security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of georgia was stressed which russia also worked on
9162775 we cannot accept these violations of international law of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
9162776 my country will extend the arm of cooperation and friendship to ease the transition period for south ossetia
9162777 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
9162778 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
9162779 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
9162780 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
9162781 i think we shouldnt be too complacent or too scared in a situation like this
9162782 to give up and surrender and say to the russians its your backyard youve won or to put men on the ground to protect georgias sovereignty and the east west oil and gas pipeline from the caspian and central asia
9162783 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
9162784 the equal opportunities environment driven from the personnel perspective became a positive disincentive for bad practice
9162785 the things that happened there are indescribable the most cruel sadistic and evil acts you could think of
9162786 they were for childrens ankles you could see that we also found a pile of about five large canes
9162787 we would try and lie still in our beds and not attract attention they came and got kids and took them away for a while rape was rife in all ages both boys and girls
9162788 i have blurry memories that still disturb me i was stripped and male staff put their hands between my legs and held my breasts
9162789 he came to the home and told paul hed teach him to swim theyd go out all day but something happened paul changed he became moody he was never the same
9162790 if you kept asking where they had gone they would get angry you kept your head down
9162791 we children of haut de la garenne have waited a long time we knew one day someone would listen
9162792 it was men and women who abused us it was dark so you would never know who it was
9162793 you were threatened with punishment if you said anything which could be a whip or anything
9162794 when all this came out it really tore me apart and brought back a hell of memories you would be sleeping then your arms would be held down most of the time it was the other kids encouraged by the staff it was all the time it was every night
9162795 after drying ourselves we were all made to stand in a line naked
9162796 if any of us flinched or tried to cover up he would hit us across our privates with his stick my escape in leap out of window
9162797 some kids you saw again and some you wouldnt we never really knew what happened to them we were told a lot of them had run off and emigrated which looking back was a bit odd we were quite often given dead arms and dead legs by the staff i remember being frog marched around the place

9162958 spa is a fantastic race track with unique corners and a very special character although these days with the v8 engines it is no problem taking the eau rouge combination in the hollow at full throttle it remains a standout feature compression is absolutely no problem physically but its nevertheless a very special sensation for the spectators too i can well recommend this section its very impressive the way the cars come roaring along downhill and then accelerate uphill again in the current race calendar spa is the nearest gp circuit to my home town of m nchengladbach and thats another reason for me to look forward to the belgian grand prix where ill be aiming to achieve a good result
9162959 from my point of view the race in spa is one of the best grands prix in the calendar it is a very unique track with high speed corners you can approach with different racing lines the most famous corners in spa francorchamps are definitely eau rouge and the bus stop chicane which was modified before last years race the circuit is very long and very tricky you have to find the right balance and the right configuration of the car in order not to lose any lap time another crucial factor is the weather in belgium it can rain in one sector and it can be dry in another sector i am really looking forward to the race
9162960 spa francorchamps is one of the specialities in the formula one calendar
9162961 spa may not be the track with the highest speeds that accolade belongs to monza but in spa we have the longest stretch taken at full throttle
9162962 nicks f1 08 is scheduled to take on a new bmw p86 8 engine with a new transmission while robert will be driving with the same engine and gear box as in valencia in the first two thirds of the season we didnt have a single retirement caused by any technical fault we aim bmw sauber f1team to maintain this high level of reliability on the sporting side we plan to improve further and see both cars finish solidly in the points at spa
9162963 spa is one of the last natural circuits remaining in the calendar and therefore ranks among the classics
9162964 its one of my all time favourites even before i first came here which was back in 2002 for a formula renault race i played it on my computer it was always one of the best tracks it has probably the most exciting corner in formula 1 eau rouge and its one of the few circuits where you really feel like youre actually going somewhere you blast off into the forest and get to the top of the hill and can feel the whole circuit beneath you its one of the best challenges in formula 1
9162965 i dont regret it but its a shame i prefer the more historic circuits like monza silverstone and monaco you really feel the history of those places whenever you race there they have real character each time they are refurbished they lose a little more of their individuality but they are made safer so we can continue to race on them so thats a good compromise
9162966 when you talk about spa everybody thinks about eau rouge but the bigger challenge is pouhon its a sweeping downhill left hander and is very fast indeed its almost flat but not quite so its quite tricky to find a balance that allows you to attack without going off drivers love corners like this high speed turns that are not quite flat thats where the real excitement lies because its up to the driver to make the difference
9162967 the reality is that we have tremendous faith in our colleagues at mercedes benz and feel comfortable with both our engines performance and reliability the recent engine failures suffered by ferrari in hungary and valencia clearly demonstrate that even a homologated engine can break so we take nothing for granted theres always an element of risk whenever you come to two fast and demanding circuits but we have the additional security of knowing both our drivers can each still suffer an engine failure without receiving a 10 place grid penalty
9162968 weve got a number of smaller aero developments in the pipeline theres nothing on the car that will be visually very startling but theres plenty of detail work were also focusing on further mistake proofing our systems the championship is going to be a hard fought slog until the end of the year and we need to leave no stone unturned in our quest for additional performance and improved reliability from a human and physical perspective these two races are also pivotal to our title challenge its vital that every member of the team pulls together to make sure these races pass without undue incident and set us up nicely for the final flyaway races
9162969 yes indeed we wanted to win nevertheless our result in valencia is no reason for us to feel disappointed we scored 13 points which continues the trend of the previous three races since silverstone we have scored 55 out of 72 possible points in those four races and reduced the gap to the top of the constructors ranking from 33 to eight points
9162970 the top four in the drivers world championship are covered by 15 points which is an exciting basis for the seasons finale five different drivers from three teams won the 12 races so far apart from the speed necessary for winning obviously the reliability of the technical package will play the most important role we have to be top class when it comes to scoring points and everybody in the team is working hard to achieve this
9162971 the track of spa francorchamps is the longest on the formula 1 calendar at over seven kilometres and after monza where we will race one week later the one with the second highest average speed of all grand prix circuits in qualifying last year this was 238 km h
9162972 the criticism on kimi raikkonen remembers me of the time that filippo inzaghi played for juventus if he didnt score for 3 games they questioned his qualities raikkonen remains motivated he only needs to start faster we still have to work on that especially on the new circuits that i dont like at all and that arent a good thing for f1 thats important you just cant pass at those tracks the driver who starts from pole position wins nine out of the ten times
9162973 we had a great race at spa last year i finished sixth which was one of my best results of the season the important thing for the team at the moment is that weve identified where improvements can be made with the fw30 and are making the necessary adjustments to take us into the final few races the work everyone at the factory is putting in should help us out in spa were not going to make a huge jump but well definitely be heading in the right direction im really looking forward to the belgian grand prix because spa is an amazing race track it will be difficult to score points there but you can never predict what will happen somewhere like spa so well have to wait and see
9162974 its going to be the first time ive driven a formula one car around spa so my first priority will be to learn the circuit and to find out how the car behaves on this track i have of course driven spa while racing in gp2 so know what a great racing track it is in fact its probably one of the greatest tracks on the calendar so im really looking forward to taking my fw30 out and doing that first lap
9162975 spa is a fairly fluid track with the corners flowing smoothly from one to another

9162998 on the other hand we get so much from red bull without red bull toro rosso would be nowhere so it feels good that we can give something back even if i would like to have him stay with the team

9163077 and i have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship me
9163078 i testify that there is nothing worthy of worship except allaah alone and i testify that muhammad is his messenger
9163079 worshipping allaah alone is the sunnah of the prophet muhammad peace be upon him
9163080 we have revealed to you the reminder the quraan to expound to the people what was revealed to them
9163081 he who obeys the messenger obeys allaah but if any turn away we have not sent you to watch over their evil deeds
9163082 when they are summoned to allaah and his messenger in order that he may judge between them behold some of them decline to come
9163083 what is found in the book of allaah as haraam we pronounce it haraam
9163084 surely i am given the quraan and something like it

9163086 a woman came to the prophet peace be upon him and he told her to come back later
9163087 the messenger of allaah peace be upon him said take as your leaders those who come after me abu bakr and umar
9163088 i said to my father alee ibn abee taalib which of the people is the best after the messenger of allaah peace be upon him
9163089 yes any one who does not say this is not a sheeah by allaah alee took up this pulpit and said
9163090 no verse did allaah reveal in connection with the hypocrites except that it is found in those who profess sheeism
9163091 if you see a man defaming any of the companions of allaahs messenger then know that he is a heretic because we believe in the messenger of allaah and in the quraan as being true it is the companions who have conveyed this quraan and the prophetic guidance to us yet they seek to criticize our witnesses to the revelation so as to nullify the book and the sunnah they are more deserving to be refuted and they are the heretics
9163092 and the muslim nation has consensus on the disbelief of the imaamiyyah

9163166 and what caught my attention are the pictures of young thai girls dressing in school uniform that are so short that they might as well not wearing the skirt at all because you can see their underwear see for yourself
9163167 this is the time of the year of new school term and i dont want to get out from my house to see young school girls dressing in their school uniform every time i look at them they give me a headache sort of feel bad for their parents and teachers as well very often that i would see them in the back of a new style motorcycle where the placements of your feet are a bit high so it appears that their feet are up in the air not to mention but it looks very much like the laying down position when im about to give birth you get the picture

9163178 russia has sent many signals that its patience was running out but the west dismissed as a rhetoric a tough speech by putin in munich in 2007
9163179 es ist toll die rallye anzuf hren aber es k nnte einige probleme mit sich bringen ich wollte loeb einholen und ich erwartete in den top drei zu sein aber nicht zu f hren ich fuhr heute am limit und ich werde morgen das gleiche tun m ssen es ist sechs monate her seit ich in schweden gewonnen habe und es w re toll hier zu gewinnen vielleicht geht die rallye ja so knapp wie im letzten jahr aus als ford mit 0 3 sekunden gewann
9163180 ich wusste dass wir zeit verlieren w rden aber wir verloren mehr als ich dachte weil am heutigen tag jede etappe nur einmal gefahren wurde gab es f r mich keinerlei chance auf einer sauberen strecke zu fahren ich konnte nichts taktisches machen weil ich als erster auf der etappe war es wird morgen sehr eng ich habe jetzt eine gute position aber loebs ist besser also wird es schwierig wenn ich mir meinen startplatz h tte aussuchen k nnen h tte ich den vierten genommen
9163181 mit 28 sekunden r ckstand hatten wir heute keine andere wahl als hart anzugreifen und es gelang uns sogar in f hrung zu gehen wir trafen dann aber zusammen mit dem team die entscheidung das 4 2 sekunden vorsprung zu wenig waren um in den sonntag zu gehen also lie en wir unsere rivalen wieder passieren das ist alles andere als meine vorstellung vom rallye sport wo es darum gehen sollte schneller als andere zu fahren aber es gibt nun einmal regeln mit denen wir umgehen m ssen wir werden morgen sehen ob es die richtige entscheidung war
9163182 das auto war heute viel besser als gestern aber es war trotzdem ein weiterer harter tag wir machten einige anpassungen an den d mpfern f r die letzte etappe und es war nicht schlecht aber wir haben immer noch arbeit vor uns auf den schnellen abschnitten sind wir nicht schlecht aber in den kurvenreichen teilen verlieren wir zeit
9163183 misano ist f r mich eine neue strecke von au en sieht sie nicht so schwierig aus aber man muss eine gute linie finden
9163184 wir hatten ein kleines setupproblem mit der aufh ngung aber ich muss auch noch weiter an meiner linie arbeiten
9163185 ich werde fr her bremsen und die kurvenausg nge besser treffen ich bin hier um zu lernen danach sehen wir weiter
9163186 am nachmittag haben wir einige ver nderungen vorgenommen dadurch habe ich mich viel wohler auf der maschine gef hlt
9163187 gewinnen ist immer super und deswegen bin ich mit diesem ergebnis sehr zufrieden
9163188 zu beginn war jules bianchi zu schnell f r mich ich konnte ihm nicht folgen sp ter profitierte ich von seiner durchfahrtsstrafe und bernahm platz eins einmal in f hrung fuhr ich das rennen kontrolliert zu ende
9163189 ein zweiter platz ist ein gutes ergebnis auch wenn h lkenberg wieder vor mir gelandet ist
9163190 am start probierte ich an ihm vorbeizukommen dabei ber hrten wir uns leicht dann versuchte ich ihn au en zu berholen aber das hat leider nicht funktioniert mit einem guten start morgen sollte f r mich noch ein podestplatz m glich sein
9163191 weil es im training geregnet hat haben wir das qualifying als test f r unser set up genutztfsagte patrick long
9163192 unseres war leider nicht optimal aber jetzt wissen wir was wir f rs rennen ndern m ssen
9163193 das waren an diesem wochenende meine ersten runden auf slickreifen so gesehen haben wir noch das beste daraus gemacht
9163194 ich muss mich bei meinem team bedanken das in der kurzen zeit ein sehr gutes set up gefunden hat das war nicht einfach weil es im training geregnet hat und wir dadurch noch keine runde auf trockener strecke gefahren waren aber solche stadtkurse liegen mir einfach weil man da sehr pr zise am limit fahren muss und nicht den kleinsten fehler machen darf
9163195 es ist ein tolles gef hl zum ersten mal die pole position errungen zu haben das team hat einen tollen job gemacht und jetzt m chte ich nat rlich auch mein erstes rennen gewinnen
9163196 ich hatte sechs neue reifen und kam jedes mal in verkehr das ist sehr schade weil ich mich echt sehr wohl f hlte
9163197 von so einer kleinen verletzung lahm gelegt zu werden ist sehr entt uschend
9163198 es war ein eher frustrierender tag das setup von br nn funktioniert hier nicht
9163199 wir m ssen mit dem setup eine neue richtung einschlagen und hoffen dass wir uns verbessern k nnen
9163200 he whose ranks are united in purpose will be victorious
9163201 so wie es heute abgelaufen ist war es erfreulich jeder hat den anderen auf der strecke respektiert denn alle wissen dass man sich auf dieser strecke sehr h ufig wieder trifft jeder macht platz soweit es geht
9163202 es wird dann schwierig wenn beide beteiligten auf ihrer schnellen runde sind dann kann niemand einfach zur seite fahren
9163203 jeder wird versuchen f r sich das maximale herauszuholen aber ohne hintergedanken
9163204 das reine ergebnis verspricht etwas was das spiel nicht halten konnte
9163205 over the past month or so many democrats have had the sick feeling that once again their candidate brought a knife to a gunfight
9163206 if mccain is the answer then the question must be ridiculous
9163207 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home or a home or a home or a home or a home
9163208 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
9163209 the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for oil companies
9163210 george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
9163211 if you drilled in all of senator mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single proposition is a dry well
9163212 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
9163213 when democrats start demonstrating courage voters stop thinking of them as weaklings when you stand up for what you believe in without fear and show how youre different from your opponents americans come to see you as principled and strong
9163214 progressives need to systematically expand the universe of access points to the progressive world view there are three main ways that this can be achieved the development of a vibrant progressive mass media a revived labor movement and the organizing of large scale grassroots social movements
9163215 conservatives dont give a shit about you till you reach military age thats right conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers

9163240 i think the situation is far less serious than what is being portrayed but at the same time certainly something that we are very unhappy about

9163243 no major concern other than day to day problems of living better electricity internet connection etc suddenly these seem to have been sort of pushed into the background and mobs have come out onto the street
9163244 relaxation of various kinds and various purposes so normalcy should be round the corner
9163245 we are hopeful that this could be achieved in the next one week to 10 days

9163249 i think what really there was an agitation over the issue of the what was wrongly referred to as handing over of land or diversion of land when actually it was not it was not necessary it was an uncalled for mistake
9163250 this is a concern even among the hurriyat and others saying that who is now among us who is trying to eliminate some of us
9163251 yeah they will never admit it i suppose but the fact of the matter is that it was certainly not the police he was shot in the back
9163252 you will know at the right time i presume and assure of who it is or which group is responsible

9163540 but these instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centres and where were they in the military operations zone
9163541 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9163542 and if that failed they wanted to create an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resource

9163546 this site is supposed to be the one stop for federal jobs however some agencies listed on this site have their own separate application procedures which means job seekers will have to complete the entire registration and profile input process again for those agencies which dont use the usajobs format
9163547 copying and pasting text directly into each field at usajobs and the other federal job sites can take as long as three hours per site also some jobs that do not meet the criteria specified in the search agents occasionally are referred if applicants do not review each listing carefully they could waste time applying for a job for which they are not eligible finally federal agencies that use this site to recruit applicants can take weeks even months to make selections
9163548 i had high hopes for jobfox but found that hr jobs are not a hot ticket with them
9163549 with one position the hiring folks were already down to their two top candidates when they received my r sum
9163550 but i really think that i will find my next challenge via friends and colleagues
9163551 my favorite site by far is careerbuilder com it is easy to use easy on the eyes and just seems to find the type of positions im looking for
9163552 that said i havent gotten any actual interviews yet via anything ive applied to through careerbuilder but at least it doesnt drive me crazy
9163553 it is busy hard on the eyes and just doesnt seem to generate the leads i want
9163554 also their daily e mail notifications are really hard to read
9163555 worktree com is awful and i regret the money i spent registering on that site
9163556 it has such a clean design and simple search that its a joy to use
9163557 before you make your first bid you have to complete a test which includes watching 20 minutes of video on elance university the process is foreign to me and i havent had the time to learn and sort out all the info it has a complex interface with lots of filtering tools
9163558 you have to fill out an extensive questionnaire personality test included
9163559 and that no one can scrutinize everyone who posts to their web site
9163560 the sending off was unfortunate it was an instinctive thing
9163561 but he had already been booked which meant he had to go i understand he now misses our first game in europe which is even more unfortunate
9163562 the knee still hurts that isnt going to go away
9163563 i have to accept that did that tackle end my career well i never played a full game again did i it seems like a great coincidence dont you think
9163564 i had run ins with people every week but at the end of the game you shake hands and the problems stay on the field that is what should have happened between me and him i just hope now that he is different
9163565 he is now in charge of players and as a manager and coach has different responsibilities football is a sport and it should remain a sport there is a line that should not be crossed and i presume that he and his players know this now

9163567 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
9163568 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signalling processes but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
9163569 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signalling pathways the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems

9163578 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9163579 considering both mccains advanced age and the state of the world today it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president i dont have any confidence in palins ability to deal effectively with iran russia china etc i certainly will not cast a vote for obama biden but nor will i vote for mccain palin
9163580 it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance

9163590 this could not have happened without the knowledge and consent of top leadership of the congress and the government the nation expects sonia gandhi and manmohan singh to break their silence on this unprecedented scandal
9163591 however i would like to warn the congress leaders and the government that any attempt to cover up truth in this scandal as was done by the joint parliamentary committee in the bofors case will not be tolerated by people that happened in 1989 it will happen again in 2009

9163595 they clean the surface but not underneath you can see the dust and meat sitting on it

9163598 i can tell you that they do daily sanitization and 3 000 environmental swabs in the microbiology lab that are verified by external sources

9163620 we also know theres a direct link to how well our neighborhoods are how well somebody maintains their property with our crime rate
9163621 were hoping by taking this comprehensive approach we can improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods and reduce crime
9163622 a lot of times when youre going through a neighborhood where youre seeing a sofa or an overstuffed recliner on the front porch youre going through a neighborhood that is also going through decline
9163623 i hate it when we have to tear a house down because we know its going to be an empty lot and were just losing tax base
9163624 our first few meetings we were really looking at bay city as a whole and what we could do about code enforcement and housing strategies
9163625 this information is going to help us to pinpoint not only where weve got blight and crime and fires but where were getting these pockets of blight pockets that are spreading
9163626 there seems to be a real concern in this community and i think its valid that weve got too many rental properties and rental properties are the source of a lot of our problems
9163627 i hate it when we have to tear a house down because we know its going to be an empty lot and were just losing tax base

9163652 my wife was physically sick and my son of 13 was brought to tears
9163653 whilst we acknowledge that this was a particularly dramatic episode we were very careful to make sure that any actual violence was implied rather than explicit and it was made clear from the outset that jases life was in serious jeopardy
9163654 this was the climax of a long running story involving jase and his former firm and we believe this was the outcome that many viewers would have been anticipating in the context of this storyline
9163655 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9163656 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9163657 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9163658 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9163659 the columns turned out to be made of drywall and laminated plywood
9163660 the loose logic of a dream state will surely reveal much truth
9163661 most of the time i have no idea where a piece is going to go or what its going to end up as
9163662 i dont trust the idea of forcing something i want to find ideas organically i find an entry point like an edge of a landscape element and just add things and sometimes subtract things its like an adventure discovering stuff in the process
9163663 something about covering the entire surface and though i didnt think about it consciously the weight of the history of oil paint
9163664 the yellowed weathered quality of the paper really opened up something it took me back almost to childhood the freedom of being able to include everything and anything it opened up the space i didnt need horizon lines i could have figures and creatures and landscape
9163665 i literally lie on top of the works and sometimes i nap on them which i think is somehow like getting my dreams in there
9163666 his love of materials his commitment to working by hand his love of storytelling it may sound a little outdated in the 21st century but the work is made with a lot of love and meaning theres an honesty to his work thats very touching
9163667 im flattered to feel that my work can be viewed as folk art as some sort of natural product
9163668 weve lost control and weve lost having our say in the greater world
9163669 feels exactly like my work to me a million stories in one they might not be complete but you sense that there are overlaps and connections you know its going to leave you hanging a bunch of times but its really satisfying
9163670 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9163671 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9163672 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9163673 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9163674 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9163675 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9163676 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9163677 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9163678 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9163679 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9163680 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9163681 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9163682 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9163683 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9163684 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9163685 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9163686 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9163687 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9163688 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9163689 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9163690 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9163691 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9163692 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9163693 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9163694 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9163695 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9163696 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9163697 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9163698 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9163699 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9163700 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9163701 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9163702 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9163703 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9163704 who are open to doing something on the production side
9163705 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9163706 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9163707 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9163708 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9163709 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9163710 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9163711 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9163712 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9163713 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9163714 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9163715 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9163716 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9163717 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9163718 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9163719 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9163720 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

9163747 ini sebuah kesempatan buat saya untuk makin bersyukur lagi dan menjadi terbaik lagi
9163748 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9163749 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

9163780 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9163781 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9163782 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9163783 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9163784 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9163785 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9163786 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9163787 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9163788 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9163789 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9163790 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9163791 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9163792 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9163793 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9163794 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9163795 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9163796 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9163797 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9163798 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9163799 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9163800 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9163801 c mo se puede esperar de m que dibuje paisajes y flores cuando el mundo est en llamas
9163802 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9163803 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9163804 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9163805 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9163806 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9163807 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9163808 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9163809 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9163810 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9163811 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9163812 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9163813 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9163814 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9163815 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9163816 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9163817 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

9163819 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9163820 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9163821 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9163822 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9163823 there are seven women and two children among the wounded only two or three need surgery others have light to moderate injuries
9163824 several recent plots by the ltte to carry out bomb attacks targeting government installations public transport and civilians have been foiled following information of such terrorist plots being revealed by ltte cadres who were arrested by the police
9163825 such attacks will not deter the process of international assistance to afghanistan
9163826 the 12 hour fasting is to overcome and ease conflict and suffering in the world and particularly for freedom and justice of the people of tibet and china

9163828 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9163829 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9163830 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9163831 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9163832 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9163833 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9163834 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9163835 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9163836 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9163837 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9163838 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9163839 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9163840 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9163841 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai
9163842 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9163843 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9163844 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9163845 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9163846 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9163847 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9163848 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers

9163852 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9163853 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9163854 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9163855 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9163856 the day is coming when a single carrot freshly observed will set off a revolution
9163857 the sickening discovery this week of 11 headless bodies heaped like broken dolls near the colonial city of merida underscored a bitter lesson for mexico the battle to control the multibillion dollar drug trade knows no boundaries the bodies are piling up nationwide even in normally tranquil and touristy spots such as merida not far from the maya ruins of chichen itza
9163858 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9163859 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9163860 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed

9163869 there is clearly a need for in depth revisionist histories of the native american remnants a few steps have been taken along this path by genealogists by tribal organizations and by a few academic historians whose points of view are neither afro centric nor eurocentric
9163870 there is a large and growing body of literature on the isolate communities written from both inside and outside
9163871 looking at legends lumbee and melungeon applied genealogy and the origins of tri racial isolate settlements
9163872 there has been a burst of scholarship concerning isolate communities but much of it must be taken with several very large pinches of salt
9163873 there is good evidence that large numbers of indians stayed behind during each
9163874 i am one of these delaware moors as a growing adolescent life posed many questions to my siblings and myself removed from cheswold and living in south jersey within the last four years i have lost my mother and my maternal grandparents all of whom were dearer than life to me i would very much appreciate anything you could forward me so that i may let my children know whom and what a wonderful lineage they came from
9163875 folks ask me all the time just what are you

9163877 oral history must be preserved otherwise history falls to the wayside as the province of the privileged ignoring the history and stories of those who were not gifted with the opportunity to read and write
9163878 oral history definitely has a place and rightfully so but there are oral histories that are not valid what it does is provide a challenge to go to work on and push the interpretation of evidence as far as the evidence allows the trick is to extract the nugget of truth from the whole
9163879 oral history is not inherently more or less truthful or accurate than written history accounts of both types must be carefully evaluated for their sources circumstances of production biases probable effects of knowledge or ignorance degree of correlation with established fact and other human filters before their veracity can be assessed for its factual utility in any given instance

9163941 its all in keeping with the strategic plan developed by the state and the visitor industry over the last five years
9163942 i certainly thought our group responded bigtime from our performance against st kilda inside 50m entries were 57 so weve gone from 37 to 57 so hopefully that will continue
9163943 western bulldogs were a bit better than us early and until we adjusted to the wet conditions it looked like wed be in a bit of trouble but once we did that the fight of our playing group was just fantastic
9163944 both teams made a lot of mistakes which was expected in the wet and maybe just at crucial times they had a little more poise than we did at certain stages
9163945 it was the sort of game that was great for us going into the finals against a very competitive side and we certainly thought we held our own
9163946 now you are free and can do what you like
9163947 the difference between a lady and a fowergirl is not how she behaves but how shes treated
9163948 die menge entscheidet intelligenter und effizienter als der kl gste einzelne in ihren reihen experten und meinungsf hrer sind demnach auslaufmodelle
9163949 der irrsinn ist bei einzelnen etwas seltenes aber bei gruppen die regel
9163950 wenn die masse selbstst ndig handelt tut sie es nur auf eine art sie lyncht
9163951 menschen so ist einmal sch n formuliert worden denken in herden wie zu zeigen sein wird werden sie im herdenverbund verr ckt zu verstand kommen sie nur langsam und nur jeder f r sich allein
9163952 f r gew hnlich bedeutet durchschnitt mittelmass bei entscheidungsfindungen dagegen oft leistungen von herausragender qualit t
9163953 alles in allem meint schmid dass hier eine statistische trivialit t zu einem buch aufgeblasen werde
9163954 fehler einzelner personen werden die kollektive entscheidung einer gruppe nicht untauglich machen solange sie nicht in ein und derselben richtung verlaufen es ist aber ein leichtes menschlichen urteilen eine gemeinsame fehlrichtung zu geben man muss sie nur in ihren informationen voneinander abh ngig machen
9163955 sind kleine gruppen lediglich ein hemmschuh f r kreative die ihre zeit eigentlich viel besser nutzen k nnten wenn sie nicht in sitzungen und konferenzen hocken m ssten
9163956 neuank mmlinge machen selbst wenn es sich um relativ unerfahrene und unf hige personen handelt ein unternehmen kl ger der zugewinn ergibt sich aus ihrer andersartigkeit
9163957 die gescheitesten gruppen bestehen demzufolge aus personen mit unterschiedlichen perspektiven aus personen die imstande sind voneinander unabh ngig zu bleiben unabh ngigkeit ist nun freilich nicht gleichbedeutend mit rationalit t oder mangelnder voreingenommenheit die personen k nnen durchaus voreingenommen und irrational sein solange sie jedoch unabh ngig sind wird die gruppe der sie angeh ren dadurch nicht minder intelligent
9163958 kollektive intelligenz kann auf alle probleme angesetzt werden m gen sie auch noch so komplex sein
9163959 devil may cry was a bit rough but i think that theres no roughness in god of war i thinks that its very well made so theres like a wall for your imagination or ideas and when youre actually creating something you dont even see the wall but with gow i felt like i saw beyond the wall so the gow dev teams imagination and their ideas were like beyond thats something else that struck me

9163983 my forecast shows the uk economy will continue to grow throughout this period of global uncertainty
9163984 the reforms we have made since 1997 independence for the bank of england and tough fiscal rules mean that britain is now more resilient and better prepared to deal with future shocks
9163985 while other countries have suffered recessions the british economy has now been growing continuously for over a decade the longest period of sustained growth in our history
9163986 the changes made by this government will entrench stability and increase the flexibility and resilience of our economy

9163991 i would love a woman president just not this one
9163992 he would have won in a landslide if he had
9163993 i guess the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team and in my opinion you need to be committed 100
9163994 thats all facets of being an international cricketer and we believe for the best interests of this team for the best interests of andrew symonds to have some time away from the game and lets try and get him right as soon as possible to have him back in our team
9163995 andrew was very disappointed but he accepts our decision and i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because hes a very important player and we certainly want him as part of our squad
9163996 we want andrew part of the australian team for as long as he wants to be a part but right now for the best interests of the team and for the best interests of my friend andrew symonds i believe weve made the right decision

9163998 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find
9163999 in der vergangenheit gab es die bew hrung f r den rest des jahres aber das wurde nie bis zum bitteren ende durchgezogen sie schien nie etwas besonderes zu bedeuten jetzt werden wir uns einschalten wenn ein fahrer auf bew hrung mit einem anderen fahrer innerhalb der bew hrungsfrist aneinander ger t werden wir etwas unternehmen
9164000 ich h tte ihn kinderleicht in kurve drei umdrehen k nnen
9164001 ich h tte ihn kinderleicht in kurve drei an ihn heranfahren ihn von hinten touchieren k nnen und ihn so umdrehen k nnen ich habe es nicht getan
9164002 ich habe versucht gegen ihn sauber zu fahren und habe es ihm nicht heimgezahlt
9164003 ich kam denny hamlin anm d red in die quere und wir sind dann ein wenig gegeneinander gefahren ich bin nie hinter ihn zur ckgefallen aber es war zu sp t um carl noch einzuholen die leute sagen immer dass ich selbst auch immer jemanden aus dem weg r umen w rde ich mache das nicht mit absicht das sage ich ihnen
9164004 ich glaube nicht dass das hei t dass wenn man gegen einen anderen fahrer f hrt und ihn rausdreht man deswegen f r ein rennen suspendiert wird ich denke das bezieht sich eher darauf wie man die bew hrung angeht wenn man die selbe sache wieder macht dann sind die auswirkungen vielleicht eine sperre oder so was
9164005 man muss seinen rger nach dem rennen im zaum halten ich w rde den genauen wortlaut der nascar erhalten wenn ich einen anderen fahrer abr umen und daf r suspendiert werden w rde aber ich glaube nicht dass das passiert
9164006 als fahrer sollte man nie den emotionen die kontrolle ber sich selbst berlassen
9164007 aber wir sind nun mal so alle tun es eine drohende sperre ist daher eine sache die mich neben meinem crew chief und jack roush teamchef anm d red davon abh lt da drau en etwas dummes zu machen ich mache mir keine sorgen dar ber auf bew hrung zu sein ich muss nur einfach besonders vorsichtig sein damit mich meine emotionen nicht berw ltigen
9164008 es sind einfach nur emotionen die den kopf bernehmen beide jungs wissen was sie drauf haben eine bew hrung ist etwas was man im hinterkopf hat aber letztendlich ndert das nichts an deiner fahrweise und dem was du auf der strecke machst
9164009 ich schreibe ihm vielleicht sp ter eine sms dann k nnen wir uns mal gemeinsam ein paar in n out burger genehmigen halt moment vielleicht isst er solches zeug nicht dann eben salat
9164010 all das k mmert mich nicht wir sind hier um rennen zu fahren es war wirklich gut einfach knallharter rennsport und das was danach passiert ist das geschieht auf den rennstrecken jede woche das ist eben die nascar man muss das leicht sehen
9164011 wir hatten immer geplant eines tages in der h chsten sportwagen klasse zu fahren die lmp1 klasse der alms ist vom technischen und rennfahrerischen standpunkt die kr nung des sportwagensports und da wir acura zu einem f hrenden hersteller von luxus stra enautos machen wollen war es nur logisch in die h chste klasse der alms einzusteigen
9164012 der einstieg von acura war nur eine frage der zeit wir freuen uns ber diesen schritt denn sie sind in den letzten beiden jahren zu einem siegerteam geworden das nicht nur rennen gewinnt sondern auch die fahrer und teamwertung f r sich entscheiden kann der aufstieg in die lmp1 ist der n chste logische schritt seite an seite mit audi zu k mpfen ist eine gro artige herausforderung und acura hat dieses jahr schon gezeigt wozu sie f hig sind
9164013 ich freue mich ber unsere gute zusammenarbeit mit acura und unser langj hriges engagement mit honda
9164014 wir freuen uns auf neue herausforderungen in der lmp1 und werden alles daran setzen acura an die spitze der alms zu bringen
9164015 die zusammenarbeit mit acura und honda war sehr positiv f r uns wir sind stolz darauf in der n chsten saison mit acura in der lmp1 fahren zu d rfen wir hoffen dass wir dort auch so erfolgreich sein werden wie in den letzten beiden jahren
9164016 wir wollen eines tages nach le mans gehen das ist unser erkl rtes ziel das wird aber definitiv noch nicht im kommenden jahr gesehen

9164108 i think the company did a very effective job of glossing over these questions in its marketing campaign and convincing the public that this vaccine would indeed prevent cervical cancer said
9164109 top medical breakthrough of 2006 has to be the cancer vaccine for cervical cancer gardasil
9164110 the hullabaloo began in june when the fda approved gardasil a vaccine widely described as 100 percent effective in preventing cervical cancer a disease that kills some 233 000 women worldwide each year
9164111 its worth asking a few questions why does the vaccine cost 360 for a three shot regimen how much do we know about the new product and is this a cost effective use of health care dollars
9164112 only two strains of hpv human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer and those two account for just 70 percent of all cases the vaccine has no effect on the viral strains which account for the other 30 percent
9164113 we dont know yet whats going to happen when millions of doses of the vaccine have been given and to put in place a process that says you must have this vaccine it means you must be part of a big public experiment

9164126 its important that people understand were in the peak of an active hurricane season that means an increased threat to the u s as were seeing with gustav and the h storm
9164127 youve got to give the knights credit theyve certainly come here to play and played a tough game and they just had a better attitude than us tonight
9164128 results fell our way and we knew that there was an added incentive for us to win today and we played a fantastic team game
9164129 it was close all day and we were just able to stick at it and we managed to get those last couple of goals at the end there and it was crucial
9164130 im not sure if im supposed to comment on that
9164131 it could have gone either way really but lucky we got the goal ill take the goal
9164132 it was obviously good to get it out of the way in the first quarter
9164133 its exciting to get back out there amongst the boys itll be a good night
9164134 these things happen it gives a chance to the other guys
9164135 we believe there may be an isolated number of products that are affected however we are recalling the entire australian product line as there can be no compromise when it comes to product quality or the health and safety of our consumers
9164136 we will not be shipping any more of this product until we have addressed the issue
9164137 the whole experience was really nerve wracking which was definitely unexpected
9164138 my hands were shaking at the beginning of the match
9164139 if i keep it inside i feel like i might play the next point worse or hit a bad shot id rather just let it all out before i play and be calm for the next point
9164140 when we were starting out in brooklyn we would have people trying to kick us off the courts and tell us we were using too many balls
9164141 my dad was giving me drills and people were giving us trouble thanks to mark weil and his academy we were able to raise my game to a whole other level than i would have been able to in brooklyn
9164142 my parents always said it was going to be my decision
9164143 and very recently i think it was august 14 th i sat my family down and said that i was ready to go pro they were very supportive and just said that we should give it a shot
9164144 i really believe that julie has the ability to start reaching the quarterfinals and better in doubles at the grand slams on a regular basis
9164145 shes just as good as any of the other girls out there
9164146 she was really helping me out on the court today
9164147 i was struggling out there but sometimes you have to win ugly and im just really happy to be in the third round
9164148 part of the reasons so many players stand back is because the volleying at the womens level is pretty poor overall
9164149 theres so many specific shots like drop volleys or short angles that you can use against a team who is at the baseline because both julie and carly are so good up at the net theres no reason why they cant be successful playing the way they are right now
9164150 we have a great friendship off the court and you always want to play with somebody that you get along with
9164151 the girls at this level are so much stronger and they have the belief that they belong out here which is something i struggle with at times
9164152 it was really important for julie to make that jump to the next level
9164153 she was getting too comfortable playing in the same tournaments

9164207 you sit down and you look around your eyes always land on something that is interesting even though it is an equestrian theme in there it is not predictable
9164208 not so much a fashion statement but a matter of living
9164209 rooms are very finished and polished but they are very relaxed there is a certain sophistication to them
9164210 i have a lamp that was made from an old boot
9164211 i think that one reason why some people like the equestrian look is because it has the british roots a touch of aristocracy
9164212 but you dont have to spend a lot of money to have it
9164213 the kids can come to see me in peoria or rome because its a traveling exhibit

9164228 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development

9164295 once oil began to be widely used by the worlds navies it was considered essential that supplies and reserves should be freely available and that the great powers should be able to ensure that their own access to sources would not be impeded hence the guidelines of british oil policy were formulated very quickly that britain should be in a position of political influence or control in the territories where oil was known or equally important that other powers should be excluded as far as possible both politically and commercially from these areas
9164296 to finish one of these races as a team and still be friends is incredible
9164297 very few can do that its just too much an individual mentality and very few teams ever come back together a second time

9164375 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
9164376 it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it
9164377 science is lame without religion and religion is blind without science
9164378 science is lame without the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world and the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world is blind without science

9164401 it puts to rest all the worries that the bullet cluster was an anomalous case we have gone out and found another one
9164402 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter
9164403 this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike the matter that we are made of and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
9164404 ideally we dont want just one or two we want lots of these things and really study them statistically
9164405 then we either use the whole lot or pick out one golden bullet which will provide the best constraints on what dark matter is
9164406 has the reality of eight gold medals sunk in yet
9164407 the interesting thing about the game is that their defense was beat up last year and our offense was beat up and thats why both their defense and our offense had bad years
9164408 in football in sports youve got to play the ball where it lies
9164409 were excited about jarod obviously wed like kaipo to be there but hes not so were going to move forward
9164410 im not sure anybody can match the naval academy offense they run it the best they run it to perfection basically
9164411 we went through some rough games we did some good things but the bottom line is a lot of guys got a year under their belt hopefully were a little better at certain positions now were going to get a chance to see how much weve improved
9164412 were not taking them lightly because theyre i aa theyre going to come here with a chip on their shoulder
9164413 now with scholarship limits and all kinds of things like that the talent level is not much different anymore playing another team from maryland its a big game for us
9164414 im so tired of all this stuff i just want to get on the field

9164418 it is a requirement for boats to have a current certificate and registration number while on the waterways
9164419 it is an offence not to display a current boat certificate and registration number at all times but it also takes up a lot of our time to run checks
9164420 if boaters display their registration numbers it will save us time and we can concentrate on finding those who do not have a licence
9164421 this was a completely unprovoked attack on a man who was simply walking along the street
9164422 we face a great new challenge a world energy crisis that threatens our economy our security our climate and our way of life
9164423 and until we address that crisis our problems will only get worse
9164424 right now the united states imports about 70 percent of its oil from overseas
9164425 at the same time the billions of dollars we spend on all that foreign oil seem to wind up in the bank accounts of those around the world openly hostile to our values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9164426 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year

9164429 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9164430 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9164431 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9164432 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9164433 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9164434 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9164435 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9164436 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9164437 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9164438 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9164439 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9164440 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9164441 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9164442 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9164443 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9164444 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9164445 fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions
9164446 i dont want either of these men in charge of the federal government neither the crazy old fool nor the simpering sophomore i dont want either the moralistic imperialism of john mccain or the welfare state to the world sentimentalism of barack obama
9164447 deaths are expected to outnumber births in the european union from 2015 when migration will become the only source of population growth according to an eu report released tuesday
9164448 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9164449 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9164450 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9164451 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9164452 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9164453 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9164454 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9164455 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9164456 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9164457 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9164458 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9164459 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9164460 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9164461 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9164462 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9164463 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9164464 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9164465 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9164466 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9164467 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9164468 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9164469 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9164470 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9164471 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9164472 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9164473 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9164474 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9164475 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9164476 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9164477 no one works for someone we all just work together
9164478 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9164479 uns tut diese situation sehr leid wir teilen die entt uschung der besucher
9164480 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9164481 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9164482 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9164483 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9164484 egal ob man das koalition tolerierung oder sonst wie nennt

9164487 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9164488 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9164489 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9164490 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9164491 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9164492 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9164493 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9164494 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9164495 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9164496 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9164497 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9164498 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9164499 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9164500 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9164501 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9164502 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9164503 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9164504 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9164505 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9164506 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9164507 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9164508 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9164509 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9164510 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9164511 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9164512 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9164513 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9164514 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9164515 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9164516 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9164517 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9164518 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9164519 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9164520 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9164521 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9164522 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9164523 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9164524 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9164525 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9164526 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9164527 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9164528 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9164529 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9164530 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9164531 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9164532 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9164533 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9164534 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9164535 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9164536 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9164537 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9164538 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9164539 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9164540 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9164541 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9164542 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9164543 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9164544 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9164545 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9164546 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9164547 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9164548 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9164549 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9164550 if it is the document can be adopted and work will start to put its proposals into action
9164551 een andere mogelijkheid waar de provider nog naar kijkt is het afknijpen van de verbinding
9164552 this transforms the whole situation i felt it was a fairly weak case for closing this post office anyway because there are so many people highly dependent on it but now the case is blown out of the water
9164553 there are a lot of people on the calders estate who are using that post office weekly for very important services
9164554 wester hailes post office is only just within the one mile distance allowed by the post offices own rules but one of the excuses for closure was the existence of the no 20 bus route
9164555 now they are going to be left without a bus service it is vital this post office is spared closure
9164556 on a monday theres a big queue out the door a lot of elderly folk use it and if they are going to take the bus off they are going to be stranded
9164557 from here to wester hailes its uphill all the way and quite a walk
9164558 if this bus service is to be withdrawn we will take that into account as part of the consultation
9164559 an approach to the managers of the hermiston gait site will now be made with a view to securing funding for a bus link
9164560 american politics are very different and there are lots of things we would definitely not want to bring over such as the very negative style of campaigning
9164561 but barack obama has managed to inspire a new generation of voters and we will be interested to see how they go about enthusing young people not just to vote but to get involved in politics
9164562 we want to see what buttons they are pushing what language they are using
9164563 we are just a few months into our five year competition strategy the climax of which will hopefully be to bring the world championships to scotland for the first time in 2013
9164564 bringing the championships plus a leg of the world cup to the eica will be a huge economic boost for the arena but also for the city of edinburgh
9164565 were right behind the bids weve certainly got what it takes to put on great events
9164566 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission
9164567 the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted
9164568 she was going to keep phoning and texting me until i had sent her the message it was strange to me that she requested it
9164569 this is purely a matter of credibility and reliability over whether i believe the accused or the girl and i dont believe the accused
9164570 a provisional date has now been booked by edinburgh royal choral union for the hire of the usher hall on october 31 2009
9164571 once this booking is confirmed a civic reception will be arranged to mark the 150th anniversary
9164572 a meeting is now being pursued to ensure success for the staging of this important event
9164573 the sports centre is one of the first parts of the school masterplan which we wanted to bring in as our existing sports facilities date back quite some way and it was agreed that we needed a more modern facility to teach physical education to our students
9164574 so it will be primarily a teaching resource but we are also keen for it to be available to the wider community
9164575 most schools with modern gym facilities find they are in demand and given its location close to the grassmarket we would expect this to be no different
9164576 we are very excited about these plans i think the design of the building has great merit and will be a super addition to our school
9164577 the scheme will provide a great benefit to both the school and the wider community
9164578 the buildings have been sympathetically designed to sit well within the constrained site and they will enhance the setting of this section of the old town conservation area
9164579 for someone with an impairment which limits their ability to travel any distance by foot the abuse of designated parking bays by non disabled drivers is much more than a minor irritant it represents a significant barrier to an individuals ability to undertake essential day to day activities
9164580 we are still working through cctv at this stage but its a massive task
9164581 weve had a good response from the public and the taxi and private hire drivers but we would encourage any of them working a shift in the area that night to get in touch with us
9164582 significantly we now believe the car was a dark coloured volkswagen or similar vehicle a four door saloon with what we believe was a white private hire plate
9164583 there is a procedure to get these licenses through the council and we are working closely with them to check their records for vehicles that fit the description but there is a possibility this man may have access to a private hire vehicle and not be the registered owner
9164584 i know there were some concerns about that but we are totally determined to catch this man
9164585 getting local residents to go along to fringe events has always been an issue
9164586 many avoid the city altogether at this time of the year but here we had a series of events a sort of outreach programme that encouraged many people to try out more shows they loved it and the performers loved it
9164587 this started as an exercise in being creative around the shopping centres business objectives to show how close it is to edinburgh city centre
9164588 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of the city taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9164589 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9164590 there are things we can do better i saw lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums as observers not participants
9164591 con ponencias de capella cancio paredes y bonorino por cierto est n todos ustedes invitados la inscripci n es gratuita se debate a gusto se come bien y se bebe mejor
9164592 que se jodan a m me parece muy bien y ahora disc lpeme que tengo cita en la pelu y luego empieza al partido
9164593 this behaviour is not acceptable especially as there were young children in the vicinity
9164594 everyone knows there has been a downturn we are having to take stock of everything
9164595 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9164596 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9164597 who is telling the truth the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad as people think but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9164598 this seems to be yet another example of cuts to community services
9164599 i was surprised the committee wasnt even prepared to look into this for a community centre this is actually very cheap
9164600 but just because the building may have gone the need for it certainly wont have
9164601 our members are extremely anxious that the present administration of the centre is being handled by only one temporary admin worker
9164602 this does not offer nearly enough support to cover the many duties
9164603 we will lend our support wherever possible to ensure that the people in this area still have access to local resources

9164611 it is unfortunate that five out of the councils fleet of side loading refuse collection vehicles are off road for essential maintenance at the moment
9164612 this has meant that on street communal bins are not being emptied as frequently as scheduled
9164613 we would like to reassure residents that we have put in extra resources to clear up the backlog of refuse and that every effort is being made to ensure that all refuse still awaiting collection is picked up as soon as possible
9164614 we usually get our rubbish picked up twice a week but i havent seen any collection in the last week
9164615 the situation this week has quite frankly been absolutely disgusting
9164616 where my street meets dalry road there are about six bins three on each side of the road
9164617 their lids are almost vertical as they are brimming with so much rubbish it smells looks repulsive and is surely a health hazard
9164618 i had a friend visit edinburgh this week for the first time and this is what he had to walk past as we headed for my flat i was embarrassed it looks so unsightly particularly further down the road where some of these bins sit outside a restaurant its certainly not what i would want to look at if i was eating

9164639 he went okay but he gave the winner 3 5 kilos
9164640 i dont know how the handicappers gave him 58 kilos he had 54 5 kilos in the weights the other day but they scaled the weights up and didnt assess him for this on the original weights
9164641 im not sure what ill do with him now but hell still probably go to sydney and well see how he goes down there before we make up our minds about melbourne
9164642 if hes not up to it in sydney then hell come back home and be prepared for the magic millions trophy
9164643 ive got five horses nominated for the caulfield guineas including chilled and this win was a good step in heading that way
9164644 he had to win today to keep the caulfield guineas going as an option
9164645 he went into the liston with a few issues we thought he was fit enough to run and he ran well enough the other day
9164646 but the grey horse light fantastic took the short cut while he weekend hussler went around the home turn like an old chook
9164647 but today he was on his game and i said before the race hes here to play today
9164648 hell settle he just likes to go to sleep you can put him anywhere hes a great horse
9164649 full credit to ross hes given him every chance to get the caulfield cup distance hes only half tanked at the moment hes still got a long way to go
9164650 hes much more forward this time around they say zabeels get better with age
9164651 i would have been happy if he ran fourth but to run on like he did was a credit to the horse
9164652 hes as good as hes ever been for a first up run i thought he was going to go straight past them but the other two had the race fitness
9164653 he was as unlucky as the others he was stopped in his tracks and had to pick up and get going again
9164654 he had to push and shove and still had enough in reserve to get there
9164655 he was unlucky in the run but he has done a marvellous job to get to where he has in his first preparation
9164656 he did something to himself in the truck we dont know how
9164657 he was a bit excited then he copped a bit of interference at the top of the straight
9164658 im pretty sure ive never won a million dollar race and it makes up for last week
9164659 he may go to a race like the spring stakes at newcastle and then the george main at weight for age before the caulfield guineas and maybe the cox plate
9164660 who knows what he can do he is untapped he is still learning and just has so much ahead of him

9164839 she was the part of you which you had never been able to untie and set free the part that wanted to dance and run and sing taking strong draughts of wind and sunlight and was instead done up in intricate knots and overcast with shadows the part that longed to look outward and laugh accepting life as an easy exciting thing and yet was checked by a voice that said doubtfully that there were dark ideas behind it all tangling the web and turned you inward to grope among the roots of thought and feeling for the threads

9164841 my problem with setting money supply as the defining measure of inflation and deflation is practical this pronouncement leads to an obsession with measuring money supply rather than with the relative loss or gain of purchasing power
9164842 in a truly deflationary setting then my cash buys more next year than it does now this was the case in the great depression you could buy more food more shelter etc etc every year now thats deflation

9164866 whats scary is that people have confused fiction with reality if so much noise is created because a man treats a woman well what does that say about our society
9164867 our society does not allow men to be romantic like muhannad
9164868 in our environment with all the stress it is very difficult to be romantic
9164869 that is ridiculous and a lie in fact i would say no other woman is cared for more than the arab woman our husbands may not show their romance publicly but they care for us they spoil us they always elevate us through their respect for women they also buy us flowers they also buy us jewelry and they also respect us unlike american men they dont divorce us in extremely high rates they dont beat us like the american movies on tv and they dont see only our beauty in us it is true that we arab women care for our houses that even if we work we find it our duty and role to do housework cook and family work but these traditional gender roles do not mean we require liberation no no i would much rather be an arab woman than an american woman and these newspapers saying this is why people watch noor are being stupid
9164870 know the real meaning of brotherhood brotherhood means that you always protect each other and that you never hurt each other

9164873 the grandfather fikhry is the one who takes care of the whole family decides everything and solves all the problems everyone respects him
9164874 i really like their belief in tradition and their loyalty to the family

9164879 a nosotros nos ha ido bien en esta lucha si vemos lo que han sufrido y padecido en otras pocas los mexicanos que lucharon por la independencia y la justicia
9164880 miguel hidalgo y jos mar a morelos fueron reprimidos y asesinados en el movimiento de reforma hubo mucho sacrificio de la gente
9164881 todo ha tomado mucho sufrimiento y sacrificio de los mexicanos porque no es f cil enfrentar los intereses creados a la mafia de los poderes econ mico y pol tico

9164886 it puts to rest all the worries that the bullet cluster was an anomalous case we have gone out and found another one
9164887 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter
9164888 this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike the matter that we are made of and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
9164889 ideally we dont want just one or two we want lots of these things and really study them statistically
9164890 then we either use the whole lot or pick out one golden bullet which will provide the best constraints on what dark matter is

9164892 there is a clash of values here we laud voluntary action and family care but we live in a society based on money exchange everything we need to live must be paid for either directly from our own private money or collectively through the taxes we pay each hour you work you get paid for and then you are able to buy the stuff like food and shelter to live but care provided in the family is done for free or for love whichever term you prefer so while you are working for free you forego purchasing power to live the more you work for free the less stuff you can buy to live granted life is not lived by stuff alone while we must be wary of where we push the distorting if we value such notions as love care voluntary etc influence of the cash nexus how are those who do live a life which requires time to be given up to providing free care out of love to live and pay their bills its a long standing dilemma and one which is not sufficiently addressed at least not in these terms
9164893 i get paid a glorious 6 70 an hour to look after some of the countries most challenging young people and for that money i endure beatings being spat on called everyname under the sun having various household objects thrown at my head good job i love my work because its certainly not the money that keeps me going and the company wonder why their staff turnover is so high at the end of the day the local authority doesnt actually care about the standard of the people who care for these children just as long as there are always mugs like me who are willing to do it
9164894 same goes for care workers for the elderly i used to get paid the glorious rate of 5 50phr before the minimum wage went up to 5 52 or whatever it is now to look about elderly people with dementia working night shifts
9164895 that really is appalling that we pay poeple to care for our most vulnerable a mere pittance we want people to look after our precious children on a wage they cant live on without being shattered by needing 2 jobs or expect them to treat elderly people with dignity when they are not treated with dignity themselves the whole of society is underpinned by a workforce being paid shite but if they werent there it would all fall apart
9164896 governments should have learned from the mistakes that led to the tragedy in walkerton
9164897 i am completely shocked that prime minister stephen harper has opted to make the same mistakes nationally that led to our disaster food security should never be placed on the chopping block in the name of cost cutting

9164907 she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9164908 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies

9165038 what they thought initially was someone having a bad dream gudgeon said
9165039 jo ann described to me that she was sitting on her sleeping bag
9165040 then this thing was right on her back the bear came through the tent she had no idea what it was she described it as ferocious it came through the tent like a whirlwind
9165041 saw the bear with its head essentially in the tent of jo ann and the tent was in a different place than where it had been staked gudgeon said
9165042 she did a very brave thing the lead guide and ran in the direction of the bear
9165043 it was just the two women standing shoulder to shoulder against the bear dudgeon said

9165052 it just doesnt make sense to me and to other alaskan consumers that when the price of crude oil goes up the price at the pump goes up too right away yet when the price of crude goes down the price at the pump is a lot slower to drop
9165053 just a general concern that hey prices are dropping everywhere like a rock how come theyre not dropping here
9165054 theres never an incentive to drop prices unless your competitors are dropping prices
9165055 they had been doing homework for many months evidently and in this last week they just started wrapping everything up
9165056 and they called me just a few days ago to say they were still looking at me but i hadnt been in contact with them
9165057 at that time the governors sense was that nothing had really changed

9165074 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two

9165103 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9165104 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9165105 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9165106 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9165114 the democrats will attempt to project the issue as whether a woman can be vice president a point the republicans can cheerfully concede returning to the question of whether this woman in particular should be the vice president mrs ferraro is manifestly an affirmative action nominee she has been in the house only since 1979 and cannot be said on the record to be as qualified to be president if necessary as say john glenn fritz hollings mo udall or george bush
9165115 i believe that someday we are going to have a woman president possibly during my life and ive often thought the best way to pave the way for this was to first nominate and elect a woman as vice president but i think mondale made a serious mistake when he picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in my view he guessed wrong in deciding to take a congresswoman that almost nobody had ever heard of and try to put her in line for the presidency i dont know who among the democrats might have been a better choice but it was obvious mondale picked geraldine ferraro simply because he believed there was a gender gap where i was concerned and she was a woman

9165132 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9165133 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9165134 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9165135 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9165136 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9165137 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9165138 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9165139 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9165430 the refugee influx has helped siliguri town to grow in many ways the refugee rehabilitation department made donations to the siliguri college and the siliguri commerce college to construct buildings land was also granted to siliguri girls higher secondary school for its building as these institutions were needed to meet the ever increasing demand for education of the new settlers the state government also advanced more than rs 1 50 000 to the siliguri municipality to construct roads make sanitary arrangements and arrange water supply in the refugee concentrations within the municipal limits in addition the refugee rehabilitation department opened a market on a 3 acre plot of land at an expense of more than rs 10 00000 for the benefit of about 800 refugee traders and named it bidhan market half of the refugee colonies are within siliguri town and the persons staying there are mostly employed in urban occupations pertaining to the tertiary sector of the economy two are in the semi urban area the inhabitants of which are also employed more or less in the same sector the other two colonies are in rural areas and engaged in the primary sector of the economy

9165458 the mint quarter wont be on site until 2011 and it wont be open until 2014 so i think from our point of view the timing is good
9165459 potential tenants are going to be more selective but all the major stores are long term players and recognise you cant just conjure up a big store overnight
9165460 if we are talking about new stores in new developments there has to be a long term commitment and the retailers we are dealing with are of that calibre
9165461 things are very tough at the moment and are going to get worse but it wont stop them proceeding with a new store in a new development if they feel it is the right thing to do
9165462 the clean your hands campaign is already set up in suffolks acute hospitals and has been very successful at helping prevent the spread of infection
9165463 were now rolling it out in every clinic community hospital dental clinic and healthcare facility within the trust my role is to raise awareness that staff should be cleaning their hands both before and after every single patient contact
9165464 staff should also feel that they are able to challenge each other on whether they are maintaining good hand hygiene too
9165465 the practices were promoting arent new they are something we have already been doing we are simply trying to raise awareness of the difference good hand hygiene can make
9165466 the campaign is also about empowering patients so that they feel comfortable and confident to ask their healthcare worker if they have cleaned their hands
9165467 hopefully by working together in this way we can help reduce the spread of healthcare acquired infections like mrsa and clostridium difficile as having clean hands really is the first line of defence against these infections

9165473 ninety six percent are well capitalized and ahve adequate reserves each banks financial stability should be evaluated on its own merits speculation about other institutions based on todays news could cause unnecessary turbulence in the overall banking system

9165477 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
9165478 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
9165479 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
9165480 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
9165481 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
9165482 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
9165483 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
9165484 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
9165485 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
9165486 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
9165487 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
9165488 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

9165494 the paris declaration promotes a model of partnership that improves transparency and accountability on the use of development resources it recognises that for aid to become truly effective stronger and more balanced accountability mechanisms are required at different levels
9165495 they will also ask whether recipient countries are taking ownership of their own development needs working with their parliaments and civil society to set development goals and build the capacity to meet them
9165496 today more than ever we resolve to work together to help countries across the world build the successful future all of us want to see a future based on a shared commitment to overcome poverty a future where no countries will depend on aid
9165497 the issue of aid effectiveness was put on the global agenda primarily for three reasons one was the need to simplify and rationalise the complex system of aid administration and to reduce transaction costs
9165498 third the present aid architecture is dominated by the rich countries of the oecd and thus suffers from a serious democratic and legitimacy deficit
9165499 the conclusion is unavoidable under the pretext of making aid more effective the paris declaration project is a form of collective colonialism by northern donors of those countries in the south that because of their weakness and vulnerability and psychology of dependency may allow themselves to be subjected to it at the accra september conference
9165500 politicians made high level political promises to make aid better for poor people but lack of progress on these commitments means their credibility is now at stake
9165501 only one third of the european commissions technical assistance projects have been or are likely to be successful
9165502 donors take decisions which affect the lives of real people in poor countries yet they are almost completely unaccountable to them one key first step towards making aid more effective and accountable would be for donors to sign up to international best practice transparency standards in accra
9165503 we know that donors have the power to unblock many of the obstacles to improving aid if donors do not make concrete commitments to change the way they do business when they meet in accra the outcome will be more inaction and more ineffectiveness

9165525 we suspect that a member of the public or persons unknown to us gained access to the roof area gathered waste material near an air conditioning duct and set fire to it in the hope the rest of the building would catch fire
9165526 we were able to arrive there quickly locate the seat of the fire and get crews in position to extinguish it

9165532 in addition to the 150 additional recruits which were recruited in 2007 08 a further 450 additional officers will be recruited by the end of this financial year 200 additional officers in 2009 10 and 200 in 2010 11 this will bring the total number of additional recruits to 1 000 over the life of this parliament
9165533 we inherited the lowest recruitment since devolution with many officers due to retire weve tackled that challenge head on and although these latest figures are reassuring there remains much work to be done
9165534 we have set out plans to deliver a more visible policing presence on scotlands streets and make an additional 1 000 officers available in our communities we are not just delivering on this but going substantially beyond by also looking at recruitment retention and redeployment
9165535 thats why we will set out plans in our first budget for scotland for 1000 more police and will encourage chief constables to focus these new resources on community policing
9165536 labour and the liberal democrats are going to have to eat a big slice of humble pie now that police numbers have increased to record levels well over 100 above the position we inherited from them

9165583 the loss of one million jobs is an outrage it drives home the point that the current u s trade policy has failed and must be changed now an uncontrolled flood of imports often heavily subsidized is crippling the u s textile industry
9165584 john mccains risky choice of gov sarah palin gives him a running mate who doubles down on his maverick image may appeal to hockey moms and other women and counters barack obamas aura of new generation change but he may have undercut his best attack on the democrat if obama is an empty suit as mccain has suggested is palin suited for the oval office herself she is younger and less experienced than the first term illinois senator and brings an ethical shadow to the ticket
9165585 she palin has an ethical issue as well alaska lawmakers are investigating whether palin abused her power in firing a public safety commissioner lawmakers say they want to know whether palin was mad at the commissioner for not firing an alaska state trooper who went through a messy divorce and ongoing child custody battles with palins sister

9165591 we are pretty sure it was a break in we found change missing from our register
9165592 we are talking to certain people not suspects for further information

9165596 many parents have cried on my shoulder and i have had to comfort them and tell them that their child is going to be ok

9165600 i know its hard for parents to leave their children especially when they are crying

9165608 john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes
9165609 sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington
9165610 this may be the thing that wins them the election
9165611 i think after this announcement and the conventions i wouldnt be surprised if hes ahead in the polls
9165612 she will likely bring in some young voters and some female voters
9165613 her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president
9165614 i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9165615 we dont have enough people in washington who understand the importance of local and state government
9165616 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9165617 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9165618 an admirable person who will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9165619 sen mccain chose a woman when sen obama did not even though clinton earned 18 million votes during the primary season
9165620 perhaps sen mccain has given them another reason to look his way
9165621 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9165622 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9165623 we are at a crossroads in this country and we need strong leadership at the top and this is not the time for an unknown
9165624 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and off our coasts gov palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil

9165628 the country has never needed you so much as it does now
9165629 we need you to recover whatever pride we might have lost we know you are made of the right stuff the country depends on you to lift the spirit of the nation
9165630 we had lots of athletes in the top 10 and broke loads of african records if an athlete finishes eighth in the final he is the eighth best athlete in the world and thats what the media dont understand
9165631 a man went to fill his vehicle and the petrol attendant handed him a free key holder when he arrived at work he noticed something strange about the key holder a little copper plate was noticeable
9165632 a sticker was on the key holder and when he removed the sticker a type of sim card was visible he broke the key holder open and inside was a small tracker working with solar power he took it to the police who told him that they know all about it the criminals hand them out follow you home and then hit
9165633 it is purely a hoax and motorists need not have any fears such assumptions are really ludicrous we will definitely open criminal charges against these hoaxters once they are caught
9165634 we have been running a caltex power diesel promotion through our service station network caltex branded key rings were issued to our diesel customers as part of this promotion these are novelty items and have a flashing device meant to create product awareness
9165635 we are aware that criminals are unblocking blacklisted cellphones and this has been happening for a while now but we now have the upper hand we have come up with a way that has proven to be very successful in tracing these cellphones and apprehending the criminals
9165636 the criminals know that we are on to them so i cant reveal the method because ill be arming them but since it was introduced we have apprehended a number of suspects and many have been arrested
9165637 we have had several incidents where people claim that their cellphones have been stolen only to find out that they had actually given their cellphones to their relatives or friends because they want their insurance to pay out let me warn them we will arrest them
9165638 its happening especially at the nigerian repair shops at very low prices
9165639 i advise all my clients to greylist their phones instead of blacklisting them because this could help us locate the stolen phone
9165640 they duplicate the imei number with cellphones that are in for repairs
9165641 they of course would like to keep it this way because these phones are all used as prepaid phones thus giving the operators money upfront
9165642 people should remember that tampering with a handset is a criminal offence under the electronic communications and transactions act

9165655 in the middle of the 5th century hijri i was a student of the holy quran and hadith in makkah
9165656 o dear me you are a virtuous person and i thank you from the core of my heart i am unable to express fully my feelings o fgratittude for your act of praiseworthy conduct nevertheless i offer you a purse of five hundred dinars as a humble present and request you to kindly accept it
9165657 sir i thank you for offering me a substantial amount as a reward but it is impossible for me to accept it
9165658 you justly deserve the reward because i am giving it entirely of my own free will i gladly give it to you as a humble token of my gratitude please do not dishearten me by refusing it
9165659 sir i cannot even think of being rude to decline your kind offer but iti is certainly improper for me to take it without doing anything to earn it the necklace is yours and i happened to find it only by chance its restoration to you does not entitle me to take anything in return please do not insist on me to accept what is not morally due to me
9165660 my son it is a virtue to be an honest person but the money is which is being offered to you is not disallowed by our faith it is not prohibited to offer or accept such presents therefore i request you to reconsider your unrealistic stand and keep that purse for the sake of my pleasure if not for anything else
9165661 sir i do not at all intend to displease you but the pleasure of almighty allah is more important to be reckoned with than your or my pleasure if there is any good in my action i will prefer to leave the matter to his grace for compensation which i do not wan tot risk for all the riches of this world kindly do not insist because i am determined not to accept any undue reward
9165662 dear abu bakr i have been honored by these gentlemen to speak to you on behalf of them about their commendable wish i expect you will please assent to it
9165663 sir you are very helpful and kind to me i cannot disregard any of your commands or wishes you can order me to do anything and it will be an honor for me to obey it
9165664 dear son we all earnestly desire you to stay here with us forever the regular imam of our masjid had died last year we still mourn his death and perhaps will do so forever his respect is deeply rooted in our hearts he had enlightened our lives with the torch of knowledge we wish you to take his place and consent to be our imam we may not be able to offer you a better paid position than that of the qazi in qurtaba but we will surely give you our love affection and respect
9165665 i am a fresh inexperienced student and feel small to carry out the sacred duties of the high office of imam
9165666 my son do not underestimate yourself we all have heard your recitiation and sermon and are fully convinced of your ability to fulfill those responsibilities
9165667 dear abu bakr your services to or townsmen are praiseworthy and beyond our expectations i am glad that you had accepted our offer of staying with us now have come to you to ask one more favor
9165668 sir i am at your service please tell me and i will comply with your order
9165669 dear son a man is not perfect without his partner of life i want you to marry and take full advantage of life marriage is also a sacred sunna of our holy prophet the sweet marital responsibilities are a real blessing which have been conferred onto man
9165670 sir you have always advised me in my best interest i take you as a father to me and in this matter also i will follow you counsel
9165671 your predecessor the late imam of this masjid was a very close friend of mine he had a daughter and when he was sure of his end he entrusted her to my protection and care since then she has been under my guardianship she is a lovely and adorable girl of good manners allah has endowed her with physical and mental beauty she is virtuous and is a suitable match for you i wish to give her in marriage to you and i feel sure that it will be a marriage of true minds
9165672 dear abu bakr that necklace and its wearer both are yours now and you can take all your time to behold them it may perhaps interest you to know that the necklace has a strange story of its own five years ago my friend went to makkah for pilgrimage and took that necklace with him to get it re polished there he lost it but due to the goodness of an honest young man he recovered it intact that commendable young man refused to sell his honesty and declined the pressing offer of a handsome reward he left a lasting impression upon my friend who always remembered and talked about him he once confided to me that he had a mind to go to makkah again and ask that virtuous young man to accept the hand of his daughter but time did not allow him to do so anyhow it was destined differently his daughter was to become your wife instead of his the decreed decisions of fate are strange and beyond the understanding of man
9165673 dear sir you are very right to say that insight into the unknown mysteries of fate is not possible it would perhaps be a pleasant surprise to know that i am the same person who found the necklace and restored it to your friend he in return offered me an amount of five hundred dinars although i was a pauper and was suffering from the agonies of hunger in those days my conscience did not allow me to accept anything that was not my due i pinned all my hopes and expectations of almighty allah for any reward and here i am with his gracious and greatest reward of all

9165690 a regra n o imediata e o pessoal ia ter mais um ano a para se adaptar para mim bateu uma vontade de estar em casa perto da torcida brasileira dif cil ficar tanto tempo fora precisamos valorizar um pouco mais o brasil
9165691 quero ser solid rio ao presidente ziza pois sei o quanto dif cil presidir um clube de futebol na verdade voc administrar uma emo o sua j dif cil imagina a de milhares de pessoas ent o o ziza com quem tenho tima rela o desde j eu cumprimento
9165692 minha mensagem para ele de for a pois ele foi amea ado por uma carta an nima acho que quem mandou essa carta um covarde pois n o teve coragem de se identificar
9165693 inadmiss vel que o torcedor invada o clube que j tem dificuldade financeira s o quatro covardes que aproveitaram o momento que n o tinha seguran a na sede do atl tico para invadir isso vandalismo puro para a gente desaprovar e lamentar
9165694 minha mensagem de solidariedade acho que ele est sendo forte pois assumiu o compromisso para presidir o atl tico que uma institui o muito grande e tem de ser respeitada pois ele est fazendo o melhor
9165695 dormi muito pouco aquela noite por volta das 2h da manh andei pela vila ol mpica pensando na prova s consegui dormir l pelas 5h e acordei 7h30 a todo momento ficava mentalizando a prova s 15h30 me arrumei e fiquei ouvindo whitney houston e bon jovi fui para a pista super alegre estava parecendo uma doida nunca fui desse jeito mas estava assim porque sabia que ia fazer uma grande prova
9165696 esse bronze mudou todo o cen rio entrei com confian a nos 50 m livre que a minha prova

9165699 como n o estou treinando deixei minhas f rias para este reconhecimento importante este espa o que estou conquistando fui jantar e n o me importei que as pessoas foram me interromper para me parabenizar estou curtindo a fama

9165705 eles t m a situa o de descer na hora certa vamos precisar da experi ncia desses jogadores na partida
9165706 as falhas do sistema defensivo aconteceram especialmente no primeiro tempo depois do gol a gente se desorganizou desestabilizou emocionalmente alguns mais jovens sentiram mais do que os outros e enfrentando uma equipe do poderio do botafogo acabou complicando o jogo
9165707 importante esclarecer que n o existe qualquer negocia o envolvendo outra categoria
9165708 no primeiro julgamento dele mandei um e mail para o clube alertando que o jogador deveria ter mais cautela vou entrar em contato novamente para que tenham uma conversa com ele pelo que eu soube a ltima expuls o foi injusta mas isso chama a aten o da arbitragem e n o bom para ele
9165709 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9165710 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9165711 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9165712 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9165713 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9165714 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9165715 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9165716 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9165717 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9165718 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9165719 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9165720 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9165721 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9165722 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9165723 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9165724 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9165725 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9165726 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9165727 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9165728 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9165729 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9165730 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9165731 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9165732 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9165733 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9165734 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9165735 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9165736 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9165737 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9165738 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
9165739 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9165740 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9165741 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9165742 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9165743 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9165744 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9165745 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9165746 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9165747 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9165748 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento

9165750 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9165751 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9165752 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9165753 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9165754 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9165755 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9165756 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9165757 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9165758 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9165759 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa
9165760 sar un presidente ha concluso che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9165761 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9165762 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento

9165764 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9165765 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9165766 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9165767 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9165768 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9165769 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9165770 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9165771 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9165772 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9165773 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9165774 to protest against the russian authorities actions in relation to georgia
9165775 they will not take part in the world championship if it is held in russia
9165776 the team will participate in the world competition if the fide world chess federation takes it over to any other country
9165777 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna

9165827 ya right you got a irish education lol i dont think so and you disbelieving im irish im irish to the bone as irish as you and just as proud of it boyo so go and shite with yourself
9165828 this author notes that people believe what they want to believe even if it is to their detriment
9165829 firstly why if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined
9165830 even if you dont know it is false material i am telling you now that it is
9165831 fast erosion which is known to give a v shaped channel whereas slow erosion in a meandering riverbed tends to have undercutting on the outer circumference of a bend but deposition on the inner circumference
9165832 remember that natural selection cannot help as this requires self replicating entities therefore it cannot explain their origin
9165833 man or even woman as the crowning achievement of some grand cosmic plan what mortal conceit
9165834 because darwin presented such unimpeachable evidence that proved that evolution was a fact
9165835 i suppose the reason we all jumped at the origin of species was because the idea of god interfered with our sexual mores
9165836 we objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom
9165837 assert that at least some of science is really about getting away with immoral acts
9165838 to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches
9165839 let every student be plainly instructed and consider well that the main end of his life and studies is to know god and jesus which is eternal life and therefore to lay christ at the bottom as the only foundation of all sound learning and knowledge
9165840 its unknown to you that every major animal phyla has been found in the cambrian layer
9165841 why i have many reasons but one of them is that it has never been observed and it has never been recreated
9165842 all attempts at creating life from non life has failed so you believe the theory that it has happened in spite of the tests
9165843 i have the tests to back my skepticism what do you have
9165844 it has for consequences racism and justifies the elimination of the weaker we do not need this unproven theory in the minds of men
9165845 upon your evolution theory which is pushed historically standing on nothing but lies and fraud and speculations which are postulated in spite of all actual imperical observations
9165846 im not talking about the educational system where i live im talking about the educational system nearly all over the world this theory is not only forced where im from its everywhere
9165847 and evolution has not been proven to be reality take it out of the public schools stop making me pay for it
9165848 moral ethical development fostering solid values your pushed unproven theory can ethically fosters nothing but hatred for other races and individual increase racism and contempt for the less well off as well as promiscuity and therefor stds
9165849 living a good and fruitful life without the need to exploit and harm others leaving fond memories to your successors
9165850 he believed in themeaninglessness of the world which darwin taugh because he said
9165851 evolution unleashed books such as the kinsey report which is absolute moral sexual moral depravity
9165852 these people who i just quoted to you arent arent merely evolutionists theyre the worlds greatest evolutionists
9165853 you can be faithful to your wife and not believe in god however there is no objective reason to be faithful if you believe in evolution all is for pure self interest and what that means is that there literally are no objective moral values i think this is one of the most drastic shortcomings of believing in atheistic evolution
9165854 on the atheistic view whatever is is right because there is no objective source of moral value theyre just the biological sociological product of evolution its complete reletivism and nihilism just as nietche saw
9165855 assert that at least some of science is really about getting away with immoral acts
9165856 the theory of evolution is not science science is geology biology or physics chemistry etc
9165857 i feel like ive wasted my time but perhaps this wasnt as much of a waste of time as i think after all some people do read this thread
9165858 exposure is the best defense to evil your apathy and lack of concern is telling
9165859 the kkk are knights which i post against and expose all the time
9165860 are you sure you want to bring this up again
9165861 evolution is a theory fully accepted not because it can be proven by biological coherent evidence but because the only alternative special creation is clearly incredible
9165862 after reading over some of the prior posts it seems obvious that the evolutionist looks at facts from a great distance away
9165863 i think i recognise this person but i cannot be sure as i will need some evidence
9165864 ah now i have the evidence before me i can confirm that i recognised the person correctly
9165865 i am convinced i can recognise that person in fact i am sure it is jesus
9165866 at a distance it can sometimes be appetising up close it is frequently laughable absurdly so
9165867 if the simplest conceivable life form has about 600 protein molecules the chance that even a single molecule could form by chance arrangement of the sequence of the amino acids in it would be between 10 450 and 10 600 depending on whose data you study
9165868 how many inches long do you suppose it is from one end of the universe to the other at least with our present astronomical knowledge can you guess it is about 10 28 that seems a small number but consider that the distance is in inches and to form one molecule the probabilities are from 10 450 to 10 600 how outrageous does the data have to get before it becomes laughable remember that the theory of evolution says that this happened not once but again and again and again to form life
9165869 it apparent to me that we are dealing not only with a ridiculous theory but with a sick theory an ignorant theory that has been hammered into the publics mind with a religious zeal
9165870 most of the believers of the theory of evolution probably really believe that the theory of evolution is an established fact but where did they acquire their knowledge from their educational establishments they learned a deception from men who have been deceived themselves
9165871 evolution has been totally vindicated by the sheer volume of evidence creationism is dead and buried along with all the other mythologies
9165872 just with matamatics evolution fails guess who gave us matamatics
9165873 the evolutionist has swallowed the big deception the nwo elite must really be proud of there ability to deceive the gullable
9165874 they know that there is a god in heaven but chose to rebel and cast there lot with lucifer
9165875 no they dont there is no evidence whatsoever for god heaven or lucifer
9165876 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9165877 no rational man cognizant of the facts believes that the average negro is the equal still less the superior of the white man and if this be true it is simply incredible that when all his disabilities are removed and our prognathus relative has a fair field and no favour as well as no oppressor he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites

9165896 su qualche punto particolare della dichiarazione sono state sollevate obiezioni e fondate riserve
9165897 una pietra miliare posta sul lungo e difficile cammino del genere umano
9165898 una delle pi alte espressioni della coscienza umana nel nostro tempo
9165899 la dichiarazione del 1948 non presenta i fondamenti antropologici ed etnici dei diritti delluomo che essa proclama
9165900 su questo anniversario pesano tuttavia le ombre di alcune riserve manifestate circa due caratteristiche essenziali della nozione stessa di diritti delluomo la loro universalit e la loro indivisibilit
9165901 i diritti umani sono sempre pi presentati come linguaggio comune e sostrato etico delle relazioni internazionali
9165902 porre la persona umana al cuore delle istituzioni leggi e interventi della societ
9165903 a differenti culture espressioni giuridiche e modelli istituzionali di convergere attorno a un nucleo fondamentale di valori e quindi di diritti
9165904 in nome di contesti culturali politici sociali e persino religiosi differenti
9165905 quando una cultura dei diritti umani rispettosa delle diverse tradizioni diventa parte integrante del patrimonio morale dellumanit
9165906 semplicemente in termini di legalit deboli proposizioni staccate dalla dimensione etica e razionale che il loro fondamento e scopo
9165907 la dignit della persona deve essere tutelata nei costumi prima di esserlo nel diritto
9165908 i mezzi giuridici previsti dalla carta delle nazioni unite e da altri strumenti internazionali
9165909 un allontanamento dalla protezione della dignit umana per soddisfare semplici interessi spesso interessi particolari
9165910 essere applicata per parti staccate secondo tendenze o scelte selettive
9165911 riguardano le vite stesse e i comportamenti delle persone delle comunit e dei popoli
9165912 privileg iare indubbiamente un approccio individualistico e framment are lunit della persona
9165913 i diritti e i conseguenti doveri seguono naturalmente dallinterazione umana
9165914 nel nome della libert deve esserci una correlazione fra diritti e doveri con cui ogni persona chiamata ad assumersi la responsabilit delle proprie scelte fatte in conseguenza dellentrata in rapporto con gli altri
9165915 offrire il contributo che le proprio alla costruzione di relazioni internazionali in un modo che permetta ad ogni persona e ad ogni popolo di percepire di poter fare la differenza

9165932 it has been against ourselves in the sense of the work
9165933 you have to fight very hard probably all you can mobilize of effort of work against it
9165934 that ought to be very very clear to you you must know how to fight really fight your negative emotions try to tell me more clearly
9165935 that is not sufficient now you know that your help is i but you must know how to do it i will try to make you understand by a kind of pciture you are in a house and a fire is in some part of it and you have to stop it we are in the presence of something quite catastrophic you have to mobilize all your forces against it it is quite a concrete thing that is happening as concrete as fire quite concrete and you have to oppose it with something quite concrete also
9165936 it is a thing that demands energy against energy or if you will energy to direct energy in another direction you have to arrive ready at this feeling of yourself before a complete process after having tried and tried very much this i want you all when you have such an enemy inside you to try
9165937 you relax and you really try to get i i is an affirmation that you are there fighting i is like the soldier who arrives on the battlefield who says i am there that must be very concrete i am here you must feel that i it comes from your sensation you must try to put all the force you can behind it
9165938 without that i you can do absolutely nothing for the moment when you say it everything else has to disappear just the moment when you say i am you sense as much as you can then you begin again i am try really to understand that you can put an energy in there and that now you must try at any cost then you will try and the beginning and perhaps not succeed but try and try again then you will attract into your i the energy that is in your feelings
9165939 you have a little sensation in you sometimes that sensation is right now all that you have to lean on in your effort when we begin to remember ourselves we say i am we say it as we must with whatever is available to us but it cannot change anything until you have tried again and again then little by little through these unsuccessful efforts we start to understand that the affirmation has contain a certain kind of something and what can that something possibly be but an energy
9165940 you remember how in fragments i e in search of the miraculous mr gurdjieff says it has to make a vibration i have heard him say that many times with his own mouth that vibration is a sign that the energy of vibrations is there and that energy is in that direction you can not do it at once you do it twice thrice four times five times i am suret aht your negative emotion is a little less after it and you will understand what the fight is
9165941 thought is the pure effort to attain the truth and takes place in the intellectual centre
9165942 and you are wet hermione you knew it was going to rain did you forget your umbrella again
9165943 mum i think i can do this all by myself
9165944 your son refused to take a nap today i mean a day of non stop activity maybe it was the rain and having to stay in but let me tell you the energy of this child he fell asleep not five minutes ago hell be up early

9166026 die ganze kritik an kimi erinnert mich an die zeit von filippo inzaghi bei juventus turin

9166184 it showed they were taking control of their country and progressing forward
9166185 if this were an organism it would be a symbiotic effect that we have through these different factors operating in concert with each other to achieve an overall more positive effect
9166186 we operate by with and through the iraqi forces throughout our operating environment
9166187 and so it is not us the coalition forces securing the iraqi population its the coalition forces in partnership with the iraqis securing the iraqi population
9166188 obviously during that time frame the fight in sadr city was a very kinetic fight
9166189 with the threat of these areas being lower and the ground guys focusing more on nonlethal operations we of course conduct fewer lethal operations as well
9166190 if you look at the big picture the less we have to shoot and destroy targets or kill insurgents indicates that we are getting closer to mission success in iraq
9166191 the changing nature of our attack and reconnaissance missions reflects a greater level of security among the people a demonstrated capability of the iraqi police and army and a general improvement in the daily lives of the population
9166192 this would not be possible without the continued efforts of our ground partners to transition security to the iraqis and aid in the economic development of their areas these positive trends have allowed us to provide a greater degree of overwatch and a reduced level of direct action
9166193 we are happy today to officially corner a stone in this project
9166194 this idea came up and it has expanded over time and we are hoping this market will be a great project and meet the needs of the people
9166195 more than 10 000 farmers live in this area but today much of this areas once fertile farmland lies unplanted and idle
9166196 there are several reasons for this a lack of electricity and water poor drainage inadequate fertilizing and years of warfare
9166197 they laid out their own reasons why a new farmers market needed to be built in this area
9166198 at that time the agricultural association leaders were simply looking for a place closer to home where they could come together under the protection of iraqi security forces to sell their produce
9166199 the national police a force that had an unacceptable reputation and performance less than 15 months ago is now the iraq police force of choice
9166200 it is a security force composed of iraqis for iraqis
9166201 is illustrative of the commitment made by the government of iraq to provide security and stability to their citizens
9166202 we control all aircraft that fly within five nautical miles and up to 3 000 feet in the air our job is to put the aircraft on the ground safely
9166203 they would always ask me or other iraqis working here if they would go out to the city and buy food to prepare traditional iraqi meals
9166204 my uncle is a translator so we contacted a few people to see what kind of set up we would need what equipment and things like that and we got started
9166205 business is good we have been set up since aug 11 serving breakfast lunch and dinner however since we are always here we also feed soldiers when they come back from a mission and might have missed meal time instead of eating a meal ready to eat we will cook up something for them
9166206 a group of people united by certain convictions or a common affiliation
9166207 since i was 15 my mom started giving me the idea of serving in the military she is real pro military
9166208 then when i was a freshmen in high school 9 11 happened and the event had a big impact on me
9166209 i lived very close to where it happened so joining the military was inevitable for me
9166210 ive been doing this for about two months and this job is more than i expected
9166211 once you get an aircraft on the radar you start communicating with them and then you tell them where you want them to land it is a lot to worry about with all the other aircraft in the area
9166212 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9166213 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
9166214 were showing the people that we care about them and we care about the future and trying to put money into the environment treating them with dignity and respect trying to get them out of their homes into a safe secure environment so they feel comfortable with us
9166215 once we do that they can start living normal lives
9166216 i hope that this will show iraqi contractors that here just like in america they shouldnt be scared of anything by helping us we are all just trying to help the children
9166217 once we assemble the packets they are sent through iraqi channels to be vetted if they are approved and deemed appropriate candidates the applicants will receive a class date and will attend the iraqi police academy for approximately four weeks
9166218 when we take the lep out he teaches us questioning techniques and how to read peoples body language to see if theyre being forthright
9166219 the area saw very little coalition presence prior to 2007
9166220 now the populace is absolutely assured of coalition commitment and the commitment of iraqi security forces
9166221 esta decisi n se pospuso simplemente porque estamos observando c mo se desenvuelve esta organizaci n nosotros hicimos un detenido an lisis de lo que esto significaba antes de fijar posici n porque igualmente tenemos importantes relaciones con venezuela como con muchos otros pa ses que la conforman

9166382 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9166383 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9166384 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9166385 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9166386 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9166387 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9166388 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9166389 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9166390 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9166391 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9166392 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9166393 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9166394 there is a feeling that the west treats russia merely as a loser in the cold war which has to play by the winners rules
9166395 the good performance of our army in ossetia has already impressed our partners
9166396 we should do everything to uphold this impression and end once and forever any temptation by our partners to resolve any problems by force
9166397 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9166398 do a b and c in any order before you do anything else then do d and e in any order
9166399 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9166400 president kikwete it is a pleasure and an honor to welcome you to the ronald reagan building and the headquarters of the united states agency for international development the leadership that you have provided to your country is no small factor in tanzanias success
9166401 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9166402 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9166403 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9166404 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9166405 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9166406 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9166407 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9166408 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9166409 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

9166412 si en ese momento no hemos salido de la crisis no habr dinero ni para el tren
9166413 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9166414 um divisor de guas para o palmeiras e tamb m a chance de entrarmos num ciclo vitorioso
9166415 n o sei por que est o com tanta pressa uma quest o de disputa e querem que as duas coisas sejam aprovadas na mesma reuni o
9166416 se durante esse processo for identificado qualquer dispositivo da lei que gere ambig idade de interpreta o ou contrarie os princ pios constitucionais de prote o ao consumidor os minist rios recomendar o o veto
9166417 o sistema de responsabilidade solid ria n o existe por acaso para facilitar a defesa do consumidor
9166418 n s entendemos que esse projeto inconstitucional pois n o cita o c digo de defesa do consumidor e mutila os avan os trazidos por ele
9166419 buyers were willing to pay more for goods that came from reputable outlets and this encouraged manufacturers to fashion their products with identifying features
9166420 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9166421 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9166422 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9166423 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9166424 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9166425 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9166426 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9166427 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9166428 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9166429 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9166430 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9166431 alhora que ha empla at al president jos montilla a tenir una actitud clara i contundent contra el govern espanyol

9166436 one small good deed is better than the thousand grandest thoughts
9166437 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9166438 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9166439 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9166440 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9166441 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9166442 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9166443 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9166444 who are open to doing something on the production side
9166445 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9166446 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9166447 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9166448 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9166449 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9166450 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9166451 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9166452 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9166453 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9166454 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9166455 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9166456 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9166457 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9166458 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9166459 es war schon immer mein traum eine band zu gr nden
9166460 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9166461 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9166462 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
9166463 twelve security personnel including the driver of the vehicle and one police official were killed in a landmine blast suspected to be detonated by the maoist rebels
9166464 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9166470 there are seven women and two children among the wounded only two or three need surgery others have light to moderate injuries
9166471 several recent plots by the ltte to carry out bomb attacks targeting government installations public transport and civilians have been foiled following information of such terrorist plots being revealed by ltte cadres who were arrested by the police
9166472 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9166473 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9166474 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9166475 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9166476 the 12 hour fasting is to overcome and ease conflict and suffering in the world and particularly for freedom and justice of the people of tibet and china
9166477 have given assurances that there is absolutely no cause for concern all that he needs is a good rest
9166478 such attacks will not deter the process of international assistance to afghanistan
9166479 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9166480 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
9166481 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics
9166482 a computer virus is alive and well on the international space station iss
9166483 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9166484 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9166485 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9166486 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9166487 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9166488 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9166489 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric
9166490 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9166491 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9166492 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9166493 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9166494 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai
9166495 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9166496 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9166497 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9166498 chads blog to see a shit load of clips of him and his hair
9166499 there are quite a number of extremely troubling links between sarah palin and neopentecostal dominionists
9166500 palin is also sueing sic the federal government over listing the polar bears as a threatened species the science was even compelling enough to convince the secretery sic of the interior that the bears needed to be listed
9166501 shes sorta mccains ultra conservative version of obama shes change he can tout against obamas maybe not so much change alaskans fully believe in though her share of the vote dropped by 7 6 in 2006
9166502 watch out cindy you know from experience your man has a wandering eye
9166503 she has more experience catching fish than dealing with foreign policy or national affairs
9166504 could sarah palin conceivably manage the presidency her tenure as a small town mayor and alaska governor has given her no foreign policy experience whatsoever true obama has little foreign policy experience either as mccain and others have pointed out again and again but during his time in national office he has demonstrated a clear commitment to the most pressing issues in american foreign policy
9166505 yes obama is inexperienced in foreign policy but at least he has thought seriously about it do you really believe that sarah palin understands the distinctions between shia and sunni has an opinion about the future of pakistan has a view of how to exploit rifts within tehrans leadership knows about the tricky task of securing loose nuclear weapons
9166506 barack obama seemed to distance himself from his campaigns first harshly critical response to the palin pick i think that campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments he said apparently criticizing his staff for going overboard as he did occasionally in the primary
9166507 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9166508 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9166509 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9166510 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9166511 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9166512 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9166513 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9166514 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9166515 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9166516 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9166517 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9166518 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9166519 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9166520 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9166521 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9166522 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9166523 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9166524 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9166525 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9166526 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9166527 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9166528 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9166529 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9166530 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9166531 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9166532 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9166533 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9166534 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9166535 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9166536 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9166537 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9166538 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9166539 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9166540 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9166541 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9166542 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9166543 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9166544 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9166545 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9166546 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9166547 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9166548 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9166549 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9166550 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9166551 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9166552 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9166553 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9166554 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9166555 it seems clear to me that the mpla will retain or increase its majority in parliament
9166556 there is a clear violation of angolan law that prohibits the government from promoting itself through the state owned media
9166557 in the end the mpla will have a lot more air time than all the other parties as a whole and this will obviously influence the final result of the election
9166558 but the angolan people are smart enough to read between the lines they know that life isnt as pink as what the government portrays on television
9166559 the mpla is using all the government means available including military airplanes helicopters boats and trucks to carry out its propaganda
9166560 on top of that it also uses up most of our time during television and radio newscasts

9166628 the central government must order a cbi central bureau of investigation inquiry into the murder of the vhp leader and the ensuing violence to trace the guilty in both cases
9166629 relief and rehabilitation steps must be taken so that the tens of thousands of christians now hiding in the forests can return home the government must rebuild their houses and also rebuild every single church that has been destroyed
9166630 in addition to burning and demolishing many houses churches orphanages and other christian properties and even police stations the hindutva goons have already killed 20 christians in an area which has seen saffron violence for years
9166631 the aimmm urges the central government to ban the hindutva terrorist organisation bajrang dal which plays the central role in such violence
9166632 home minister shivraj patil must act now to stop the vhp sponsored violence over dalit and tribal christians before the situation goes out of control

9166659 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
9166660 hillary moving for acclamation just put the good housekeeping stamp of approval on the whole thing
9166661 it totally worked i told you it would create more unity than trying to force unity by ignoring the divisions
9166662 i never had any doubt that hillary would do what she did she is a true star putting the country ahead of herself
9166663 i cant say that since this convention started i havent thought about it because i have
9166664 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
9166665 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
9166666 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
9166667 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9166668 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9166669 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaida the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9166670 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9166671 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9166672 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaida
9166673 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9166674 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaida the taliban and associated organizations
9166675 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9166676 mccain had to protect his reputation as an opponent of status quo washington he had to pick someone with the shortest washington r sum he did that he picked someone the right wing is going to be happy about but its a gamble
9166677 the question is what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9166678 mccain declared friday as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in dayton ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention in st paul minn
9166679 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9166680 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9166681 a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not joe biden
9166682 hes a respected washington lifer whos run into political forces that are bigger than himself and hes responded by making a decision that feels panicky

9166686 we are looking at something that is very important to our budget
9166687 whats wrong with these small charities being able to play these games and raise some money
9166688 the governor wanted budget reform to limit spending he gets it the governor wanted a sales tax increase he gets it the governor wanted deeper cuts he gets it
9166689 the only demand we did not give the governor is the tax break the tax cut after the temporary tax expires
9166690 a tax increase right now during this fragile time in the california economy should be the last thing we do not the first thing we do
9166691 i think that the senate is doing something very courageous today
9166692 everyone has to recognize that we all have to go through this painful thing and do things that we normally dont want to do
9166693 here we are on day 60 of an impasse in california

9166699 but then it turned out he was ahead of his time
9166700 they jurors got it right he acted in self defense
9166701 casey was a nonviolent person and its a sad day for marin county to see that you can attack someone with your two friends until he dies and then claim self defense because youre a marine
9166702 this case uncovered corruption by the wealthy and influential and todays guilty verdicts render assurance that the justice system cannot be bought by those with money and power

9166711 as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the european union both social and economic are now expressing unease
9166712 one reason influencing some christians may be what pope john paul ii described as the loss of christian memory in european institutions and policy successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
9166713 this coincides with a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
9166714 it has not been unknown for example for individuals to have to defend their right to hold political public or legislative office within european union institutions while professing a public commitment to their christian faith sometimes against very public and hostile challenge
9166715 if the governments of the union want to be closer to their citizens how can they exclude from europes identity an essential element like christianity with which a vast majority continues to identify themselves
9166716 a community that is built without respect for the authentic dignity of human beings that forgets that each person is created in gods image ends up not doing any one any good
9166717 ends up with christians as such being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges such as for example the right to employ people who support the ethos of a christian institution
9166718 the same might be said of positions taken over stem cell research the status of same sex unions the primacy of the family based on marriage the culture of life
9166719 the prevailing culture and social agenda within the european union would at least appear to be driven by the secular tradition rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
9166720 as it is in ireland as in much of the european union the prevailing political correctness and dominant media culture is one of relegation of the search for truth and the value of religion in society in favor of a political environment without god
9166721 in this context it is not surprising that we might speak of a european continent that is losing confidence in its future
9166722 senator mccain was against the bush tax cuts and now says hes for the bush tax cuts he was against ethanol then for ethanol then against ethanol

9166856 i just try to concentrate on what i can do to improve as a player thats not going to change this is my approach
9166857 we have a working relationship and i think we have the same goal and thats to get this team to win
9166858 what theyre discussing i cant change so that subject is what it is
9166859 i control what i can control and get us as good as we can get with what i can control i dont have control of that
9166860 when you take this job you realize who the owner is and you realize most guys dont last really long so that is what it is
9166861 if you sit there and worry about that and you think about that youre not doing the best that you can for your team
9166862 a lot of my friends and family are oakland fans so i dont want to have to listen to the negative talk
9166863 its just very important to just get back to winning to get back to the oakland mystique the silver and black thats what we need to get back to

9166874 should the situation on the border heat up once again and war erupts kassem warned that hezbollah was more prepared than ever and israel would suffer even worse casualties than before the next war will be worse than the aggressions of july the mental situation of the israelis is dejected and if the israelis come in they will suffer heavy human losses israel always prefers that the fighting take place out of its territory

9166878 yes but if their stuck they wont be showing true thermal limits and although the false value is within limits the real value may not be
9166879 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
9166880 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
9166881 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
9166882 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
9166883 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock

9166897 my daughter sees this stuff all of the time on internet posts and on facebook
9166898 we are always pretty conservative in our estimates and we were predicting we would be down approximately 150 students from june to september
9166899 what that means is there are fewer five year old students in the central okanagan versus graduating grade 12s
9166900 its going to be real interesting by the end of the first week of september because weve got schools that are reporting significant numbers of new families to the area its not the family that moves from lakeview heights to the mission its families coming in from alberta ontario even overseas
9166901 she was late in delivering and she had to be induced they sent her home because nothing was happening

9166904 wow she caught her own baby im so proud of these girls
9166905 my oldest daughter took a string out of her coat and tied it off while they were waiting for the ambulance
9166906 the operators were noticing some issues with them so we decided to shut the pumphouse down

9166930 over the past week police and partners have been working hard to not only target the offenders that carry out this distressing crime but to raise as much awareness as possible of the tactics these criminals use to get into peoples homes
9166931 although incidents of distraction burglary have reduced significantly across greater manchester over the past few years during the summer months we do typically tend to see an increase
9166932 its important that people realise that even groups of people that are generally trusted such as the clergy council workers and charity workers should always be asked for proof of identity if you have any doubts as to their credibility dont let them in and dont be pressurised into buying anything from cold callers
9166933 both the police and trading standards have committed considerable resources to tackling the issue of doorstep crime
9166934 it is important that people report any incidents or suspicions they have about doorstep callers in their area to trading standards or the police so that appropriate action can be taken
9166935 the victim said he was struck by a car and i believe the driver targeted him and drove at him deliberately
9166936 we do not have a description of the car but there must have been people in the area at the time who may have seen something before during or after the collision
9166937 in the interests of the safety of all students as well as in recognition of the schools physical environment
9166938 the school will work with its parents and citizens committee and the school community to ensure an appropriate balance between student safety and their right to engage in gymnastic activities
9166939 has since undergone hospital surgical medical and para medical treatment
9166940 we make every effort to minimise risk for the girls
9166941 its all part of this wussification syndrome that were seeing in contemporary australia where schools have been forced to bow to the great god of occupational health and safety
9166942 we have schools in victoria which have banned birthday cakes with candles on them because the children might burst into flames and where soccer has been banned during recess because the kids might be hit in the face by the ball
9166943 children are not accessories to dress up and keep behind glass if we continue to cloak them in cotton wool and outsource their development to lawyers we will have a bunch of kids who are almost frightened of the world this is very serious
9166944 when you do something thats a little bit on the edge the lessons are learnt before you get to an age when the toys youre playing with can potentially kill
9166945 if they havent learnt appropriate risk taking before theyre in charge of a motor vehicle the consequences are often fatal
9166946 hovering over their children keeping the germs away and making sure that theyre safe
9166947 if you extend this ludicrousness to its logical end no child will ever learn to ride a bicycle because they might fall off
9166948 an essential part of growing up is exposure to the fact that life isnt always fair
9166949 when things do go wrong children can pick themselves up start again and learn from the negative experience
9166950 because were sheltering them from that im seeing 12 and 13 year old kids who are just normally sad because their dogs died or their parents have divorced and theyre running off to gps looking for anti depressants because they think theyre depressed
9166951 but schools have increasingly sanitised the playing environment for kids taking out a lot of the monkey bars in order to protect from litigation
9166952 as a result if kids do any physical activity its usually not involving their upper body most kids today couldnt hang and support their weight
9166953 he was modeling himself to some extent on fdr and producing a mixed bag of policies that would be so amorphous no one could really figure it out
9166954 it is great to see former young offenders putting their troubled pasts behind them and helping others to do the same
9166955 so go back to popping your girlfriends ass pimples and have a nice night

9166957 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9166958 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9166959 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9166960 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9166961 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9166962 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9166963 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9166964 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9166965 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9166966 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9166967 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9166968 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9166969 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9166970 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9166971 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9166972 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us

9166975 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9166976 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9166977 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9166978 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9166979 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9166980 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9166981 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9166982 no one works for someone we all just work together
9166983 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9166984 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9166985 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9166986 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9166987 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9166988 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9166989 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9166990 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9166991 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9166992 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9166993 una partita di calcio deve essere sempre una festa per chi va allo stadio
9166994 lultima volta stato davvero un peccato dover giocare a firenze senza la spinta dei nostri tifosi sono contento che domenica sera possano invece essere al nostro fianco
9166995 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9166996 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9166997 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9166998 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9166999 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9167000 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9167001 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9167002 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9167003 es war nicht einmal eine frage des gehalts da fluminense mir am ende mehr als hamburg geboten hat aber es ist eine herausforderung f r mich ich hoffe ich werde gl cklich in hamburg
9167004 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9167005 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9167006 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9167007 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9167008 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9167009 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9167010 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9167011 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9167012 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9167013 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9167014 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9167015 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9167016 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9167017 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9167018 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9167019 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9167020 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9167021 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9167022 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9167023 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9167024 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9167025 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9167026 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9167027 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9167028 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9167029 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9167030 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9167031 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9167032 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9167033 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9167034 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9167035 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9167036 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9167037 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9167038 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9167039 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9167040 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9167041 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9167042 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9167043 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9167044 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9167045 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9167046 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9167047 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9167048 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9167049 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9167050 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9167051 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9167052 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9167053 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9167054 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9167055 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9167056 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9167057 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9167058 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9167059 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9167060 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9167061 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9167062 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9167063 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9167064 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9167065 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9167066 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9167067 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9167068 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9167069 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9167070 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9167071 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9167072 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9167073 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9167074 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9167075 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9167076 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9167077 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
9167078 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
9167079 today we have begun a total strike in the government run health sector in the gaza strip and there is good participation with 70 percent taking part
9167080 the strikes follow calls issued by fatah run unions in ramallah
9167081 it is aimed at strengthening the blockade on hamas the palestinian government and the palestinian people
9167082 understood the motivations for it which come from the oppressive actions taken against our workers in the gaza strip
9167083 these poisonous calls come when there are more than 1 600 patients in desperate need of treatment and care
9167084 we will not let anyone mock the health security of our citizens
9167085 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone

9167088 i tried to stay off the internet and just in my experience here with all the things that have gone on i really dont listen to the talk or what people expect or anything like that
9167089 i just try to concentrate on what i can do to improve as a player thats not going to change this is my approach
9167090 we have a working relationship and i think we have the same goal and thats to get this team to win
9167091 what theyre discussing i cant change so that subject is what it is
9167092 i control what i can control and get us as good as we can get with what i can control i dont have control of that
9167093 when you take this job you realize who the owner is and you realize most guys dont last really long so that is what it is
9167094 if you sit there and worry about that and you think about that youre not doing the best that you can for your team
9167095 a lot of my friends and family are oakland fans so i dont want to have to listen to the negative talk
9167096 its just very important to just get back to winning to get back to the oakland mystique the silver and black thats what we need to get back to
9167097 convicted in federal court of computer hacking and placed on probation

9167104 no single individual in the entire nation who can stir the blood and energize the soul
9167105 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9167106 there is a place where nothing you do is ordinary even if youre just pumping gas
9167107 exactly what i need exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics
9167108 shes got the grit the integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9167109 i never really set out to be involved in public affairs much less to run for this office
9167110 with fellow reformers in the great state of alaska as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual to the special interests to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good ol boy network
9167111 its always safer in politics to avoid risk to just go along with the status quo but i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9167112 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons and the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and servants hearts
9167113 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9167114 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9167115 for my part the mission is clear the next 67 days im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america then were asking for your vote on the 4th of november
9167116 we have four charity gigs every year and we will still do them but we will not do a record or tour even when we play now were not as close as we were i dont miss the getting big or all that stuff i miss when we were real close
9167117 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
9167118 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9167119 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
9167120 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
9167121 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
9167122 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
9167123 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
9167124 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
9167125 if something like this had happened to the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
9167126 a second tier to the top tier of call center providers
9167127 had iac or prc disclosed the true circumstances surrounding the verizon wireless contract as they were contractually obligated to do diamond castle would not have proceeded with the prc acquisition

9167140 where individuals can resolve the system at the lowest level possible

9167143 for how long did they know a new browser was coming and not fix this what does that tell me about their responsiveness
9167144 yes you can deploy it but be warned the apps still are catching up
9167145 the new royalty rates are so high and increasing in the next three years the vast majority pay 008 us cents per song per listener
9167146 a lot of these stations wont make it under the current royalty system
9167147 the board essentially ignored webcasters suggestions and went with a much higher rate
9167148 were hopeful that there will be some action in the new congress next year
9167149 there already has been progress made but its a slow process
9167150 it works really nicely and theyre in the process of launching new features of that product that do it a little differently its kind of a visual representation of what you like and dont like i think theyre going to have a big hit with it
9167151 traditional media need to be focused on internet opportunities just like newspapers going online
9167152 one is whats the model is it a subscription model or advertising model i think subscription models work for a limited amount of listeners but if its going to be mainstream and widely used it needs to be free and ad supported
9167153 if youre a local business that wants to advertise on wfan a new york based all sports station you can do it
9167154 they may buy the zip codes and market to the ones they want i may have a sports bar in l a that wants to reach people interested in sports in in the l a area theyll buy only the listeners who are listening to wfan in l a its a very powerful local medium and and you have to be careful youre not buying the entire station but the local portion of that station
9167155 what it means is you can now put internet radio on your iphone that means you can have internet radio wherever you go i think its highly favorable in terms of revenue growth
9167156 pandora said in the last month that their growth rate was up nearly 40 percent merely because of the iphone
9167157 when you sign up for an account youre putting several data points in there and its all very rich from a targeting perspective
9167158 you can reach people who are listening online the ability to have an audio ad is compelling on online radio because it cuts through the visual noise the people are there listening to music you can reach them in a way you wouldnt have in any other situation
9167159 the opportunity with a pandora is to take all your listeners and be able to target down to the zip code for your in stream audio ads and target different genres people listen to
9167160 i think the growth induced now by the iphone will help them pay that
9167161 secondly i think the growth induced by the iphone will make the labels more willing to accommodate reductions in royalties
9167162 its a great opportunity to listen to internet radio wherever you are
9167163 this is a 20 billion per year business and a big slice of that ad pie will come from mobile radio

9167180 do you think democrats who supported hillary rodham clinton will be more inclined to vote republican with sarah palin on the ticket
9167181 so we get inexperienced sarah palin if john mccain dies but we get inexperienced barack obama if barack obama lives
9167182 so we get inexperienced sarah palin if john mccain dies but we get inexperienced barack obama if barack obama lives
9167183 but the point is its my vote and i plan to vote for who i trust the most with my country
9167184 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and governor youre no hillary clinton
9167185 gail collins ny times writes that joe biden may already be practicing his drop dead line for the vp debate
9167186 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and governor youre no hillary clinton
9167187 it insinuates shes not capable of that but for some reason obama is
9167188 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers
9167189 the worst part about the dems reaction to the palin pick is that they should have seen it coming
9167190 because it was in the best interests of the democratic party
9167191 we lost but we were right the next meeting of talking about the way things should be will be held on
9167192 thanks for the honor but i am not serving you guys dinner eddie will be home soom mr obama come back later
9167193 usually this is a matter of privacy but since she seems so ready to take away a womens right to privacy this is something that might need discussing
9167194 i think some powerful karma is about to crank into full gear i give karma a standing ovation
9167195 more importantly senator obama is no hillary clinton and no john mccain
9167196 i think some powerful karma is about to crank into full gear i give karma a standing ovation
9167197 id like to retract some of the thoughts of her qualifications that are stirring in my head sarah palin is likely qualified to wash my dishes even moreso to fetch a big wheel from my driveway i was thinking she wasnt but those are just exaggerated thoughts
9167198 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine and governor youre no hillary clinton
9167199 neither senator biden are you you got 9239 votes she got 18 million
9167200 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9167201 if the rate of change outside the firm is greater than the rate of change within it then you are in decline
9167202 maybe there will be a big purple or a dark purple or many small but varied shades i hope i get some purple i could really use some purple im low on purple people love purple
9167203 we have been copying from the copies for centuries but you make a good point my son
9167204 we missed the r we missed the r we missed the r
9167205 and i attribute it all to the rich blessings of god in my life i remember that turning point in my faith i had just earned my first dollar and i went to a church meeting that night the speaker was a missionary who told about his work i knew that i only had a dollar bill and had to either give it all to gods work or nothing at all so at that moment i decided to give my whole dollar to god i believe that god blessed that decision and that is why i am a rich man today

9167211 the gender gap traditionally has been determined by party preference not by the gender of the candidate

9167215 so no i never thought i would see a black man nominated for president this is such a great day
9167216 god wouldnt let it rain on a moment like this
9167217 were all sitting on feelings we dont usually talk about were starved for a collective sense of affirmation barack is the son the brother the uncle the cousin who made good who overcame god bless him for what he means to us
9167218 i got married at 14 only because i wanted to get out of there
9167219 i had to at 14 i was just being promoted from the second grade to the third grade because we could only go to school when we werent working in the fields
9167220 barack obama is a measure of how far weve come as a country since i was a little girl
9167221 they just didnt want to let us in so we stood there watching to see if they would let anyone else in
9167222 they all stood there with us to back us up
9167223 and then we came back the next day which was sunday and stood there until 2 or 3 in the afternoon when they finally decided to let us in
9167224 we meet today to pass the torch to a new generation of americans a generation that came of age amid iced chais and mocha strawberry frappuccinos
9167225 i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9167226 the afps announcement highlights yet again the inadequacy of the current haneef inquiry which is not a full blown properly constituted royal commission
9167227 theres been a lingering suspicion which has firmed up that the afp in maintaining the investigation against dr haneef for the last 12 months has really been engaged in a smoke screen back protection exercise and theres been no reason for dr haneef to be kept under investigation
9167228 what the inquiry should look at is how much money what resources has the afp used in the last 12 months and has there been a legitimate line of inquiry it has been following or has it simply been parroting that line as a back protection exercise
9167229 quite inexplicably the rudd election campaign promised to set up an inquiry it turned out to be a mickey mouse inquiry because its not conducted under the provisions of the federal royal commissions act
9167230 it is not a royal commission it is not sitting in public it cant force the afp among other agencies to produce witnesses or produce documents it can only ask them to

9167243 we havent won the last two games and thats not down to berba its down to ourselves
9167244 if we sell guys like keane and berbatov then they will buy top players to replace them
9167245 it keeps going in circles but maybe we have to stop selling
9167246 im not using spurs as a stepping stone theyre going to be a top club the players cant help it if people are sold
9167247 if it was me maybe i wouldnt do it in the first place i would play
9167248 i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise but i dont know what has gone on behind closed doors with the manager
9167249 ill always give 100 wherever i am if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game all the time
9167250 i was happy to come down here from middlesbrough but the manager will tell you that i would always give my all for the club and thats the way that it has to be
9167251 okay it hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country from the supporters point of view but theres always two sides to the story
9167252 im sure that berba will give his all for the team if selected hes a spurs player so you expect him to give 100
9167253 elrosa historical facts and lore of the first 100 years 1908 2008
9167254 i support your efforts to keep max at zach so that he can thrive surrounded by family and familiar faces
9167255 he lived in a bubble at first but when we got the diagnosis we went into ultra bubble
9167256 any cold can turn into pneumonia that he wont make it through
9167257 i thought i can be selfish and keep him locked up in a bubble or i can take a risk and let him live
9167258 he spent the first five years of his life surviving now hes living

9167265 i want to emphasize that what you did you did it in a position of trust
9167266 you actually deceived her parents a second time that in the courts view is unacceptable
9167267 they put their trust in me and i let them down

9167274 eighty per cent of bone mass is accrued in the first 20 years and especially around puberty due to the circulating hormones this study targets a window of opportunity in adolescence to maximise peak bone mass with high intensity weight bearing activity
9167275 peak height velocity is at different ages in boys and girls most boys in the group were right at that stage while most girls in the study were past puberty

9167277 my eighth daughter s legs were atrophied and curled up
9167278 my husband pham van chinh cao s father served in the army during the war with the and was exposed to the highly toxic agent orange and now 26 years after that accursed war cao is yet another victim of the deadly disease
9167279 i had no legs to go to school like my friends but i have hands
9167280 i will never forget my first day in school that was 2001 2002
9167281 some friends sneered at me some screamed with laughter and some felt sorry for me when i entered the class i felt ashamed and under great pressure but i promised myself that i would try my best to study as well as my fellow classmates did
9167282 cao is a good sensitive and energetic student in class she s also good at writing and singing and has a good relationship with her classmates she s a role model with her eagerness to learn and overcome difficulties not just for ethnic minority students but everyone in the class
9167283 we highly appreciate the great effort it must take for cao to not just attend school but also excel
9167284 about 90 per cent of our students in the mountainous school are members of ethnic minorities around here working to prevent hunger and poverty is often considered far more important than an education the rainy season which lasts one or two months always results in many students dropping out even though textbooks and school fees are free
9167285 cao is truly a special girl and we continue to encourage her
9167286 i want to try my best to help my mum
9167287 this way she ll earn more money for us to eat and for my dad s medicines i also try to take care of myself so that she doesn t have to worry about me
9167288 in order to promote this dignity in an integral way so called christianophobia should be combated as decisively as islamophobia and anti semitism

9167302 cool i am going to visit 2 different parts of london in one day
9167303 pablos obviously here and were discussing his situation we hope that its going to be concluded
9167304 weve got time enough barring any last minute hitches hes of the right quality that were trying to attract
9167305 the thing with any team ive been involved in is that i dont allow players to leave unless i feel that the club will become stronger as a consequence
9167306 at the end of the day it will be my decision whether anybody leaves
9167307 were in the market for a number of players in a number of positions how many were able to conclude before monday well have to wait and see
9167308 hopefully i can get back but health is more important right now
9167309 i use this at least 3 times a day in my home gym
9167310 since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists whether through design or stupidity i do not know as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms
9167311 it says that heat will not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one or equivalently that total entropy a measure of useful energy in a closed system will not decrease this does not prevent increasing order because the earth is not a closed system and entropy is not the same as disorder
9167312 the only processes necessary for evolution to occur are reproduction heritable variation and selection all of these are seen to happen all the time so obviously no physical laws are preventing them in fact connections between evolution and entropy have been studied in depth and never to the detriment of evolution
9167313 the spontaneous generation that pasteur and others disproved was the idea that life forms such as mice maggots and bacteria can appear fully formed they disproved a form of creationism there is no law of biogenesis saying that very primitive life cannot form from increasingly complex molecules

9167335 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought he said
9167336 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the
9167337 weve got to rediscover the zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9167338 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9167339 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9167340 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9167341 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9167342 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9167343 they wanted to make an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resources
9167344 instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centers and where were they in the military operations zone
9167345 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war

9167361 cataract is something that most of us will develop at some point in our lives the key is to understand what we can do now to help protect our vision in the future
9167362 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
9167363 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
9167364 suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration
9167365 we may have a little way to go but thats not bad
9167366 vaccines are probably one of the top two or three public health interventions of all time
9167367 they now have been so successful they suffer from their success because people dont see the diseases and the horrors associated with them
9167368 you get something called herd immunity although i wish there were a better name for it
9167369 if you get enough people vaccinated even people who arent vaccinated are protected because the disease cant transmit the virus cant get past the wall of vaccinated people weve created
9167370 several vaccines for that age group just kind of came up
9167371 the issue is explaining the vaccine at a time when neither the child nor the parent want to think about this when the girl is still preteen
9167372 i say this is to prevent cervical cancer and you have to receive it before youre infected
9167373 theres not the same push if youre not going to college so they dont think about it
9167374 i think eventually it will be universally recommended for everyone every year
9167375 we need to do a better job at immunizing people against flu
9167376 everyone over 50 should get one and so should kids because were discovering theyre the reservoir for flu theyre in a closed container called school so they transmit it easily between themselves and then they bring that little present home
9167377 if my patients come in for a routine visit or a sick visit ill look at their immunization record
9167378 youre not going to get that so much if youre bouncing around from provider to provider because theyre not going to have the record
9167379 the evidence is becoming clearer every day that vaccines do not cause autism but there are some very stubborn groups out there who still make that claim
9167380 this finding suggests an urgent situation in which the largest numbers of transferred youths in need of psychiatric services are also the least likely to receive them
9167381 the investigation is progressing steadily with a team of detectives working over the weekend gathering evidence and endeavouring to establish a motive
9167382 the injuries suffered by this man are horrific extreme violence has been used
9167383 it is among the worst beatings that i have seen for a long time
9167384 the conclusion is that the mere presence of ear wax does not require anything
9167385 are much more likely to develop problems with ear wax
9167386 these guidelines are followed already by the majority of ear nose throat doctors
9167387 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
9167388 inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development
9167389 there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
9167390 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
9167391 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9167392 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9167393 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9167394 this may have stifled efforts at developing newer and better vaccines especially for use in the elderly
9167395 improving quality of care are better directed at where the evidence is such as hand washing vaccinating children and vaccinating health care workers
9167396 the ret ptc rearrangements were more common among cancers from individuals with higher radiation exposure doses cancers that occurred earlier after the a bomb exposure and cancers among those who were at younger ages at a bomb exposure
9167397 needs to be confirmed with additional ptc patients in the future
9167398 the fact that radiation exposure is associated with thyroid cancer is well known and not news
9167399 but now as research technology has caught up with scientific expectations theyre now able to identify the specific chromosomal anomaly that causes the cancer and indeed this is exactly what you would expect
9167400 historically patient autonomy was something we really needed to pay attention to over the last 20 to 30 years this whole issue of medical technology and making sure patients have a say over their care but what were learning is that patients cannot make decisions in a vacuum because they really experience a series of relationships that affect who they are as a person and thats especially true when they have medical care my perception of this article is that it validates reality
9167401 it seems to be especially difficult to make life and death decisions for patients who cant speak for themselves
9167402 physicians on the ground every day wrestle with this we wanted to find out more about what it is like for physicians on the ground
9167403 physicians considered the wishes or needs of the surrogate or family in addition to those of the patient and those arent really accounted for in any of the ethical models nowhere does it say that its ok to do something because the parents child tells you thats what they want but to some extent thats what physicians do
9167404 they have the clinical expertise and a sense of duty to the patient
9167405 they have a stake in determining whats best for the patient its part of their obligation
9167406 going further with treatment like you know trach and g tube and these sorts of things and likely ventilator dependence was just futile just inappropriate just not right for the patient
9167407 its very reasonable for us to examine that family input is important and should be valued
9167408 maybe ethical models are too narrow and maybe they should consider other factors as well
9167409 defend the interests of this club in the best manner possible
9167410 i have a contract with real madrid now but we are still negotiating with chelsea
9167411 a lot of things are being published and they are not the truth
9167412 i have seen all the games and we look very strong even better than the squad last year
9167413 weve come in as underdogs and have hit our straps in every single department
9167414 the blokes have done an amazing job but we want to improve and want to try to win the series 5 0 if we can
9167415 there are seven women and two children among the wounded
9167416 there were fewer people today because of the rains from the morning
9167417 we heard the sound of a blast but we thought it was a firecracker it didnt sound like a huge bomb
9167418 several recent plots by the ltte to carry out bomb attacks targeting government installations and civilians have been foiled following information of such terrorist plots being revealed by ltte cadres who were arrested by the police
9167419 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9167420 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9167421 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9167422 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9167423 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9167424 they wanted to make an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resources
9167425 instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centers and where were they in the military operations zone
9167426 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9167427 this top down ultimatum delivered today stands to directly breach undertakings the company made yesterday afternoon in the australian industrial relations commission not to lock out staff who return to work on monday
9167428 weve found other hotels for those passengers who were unable to stay on in their accommodation
9167429 there were all these traffic jams because there were mobs rioting and stuff and to get out of there we walked for a kilometre and climbed the fence to get into the airport
9167430 on the way to the airport it was a bit scary to be honest and we panicked because weve never seen real shooting guns
9167431 certitude belongs exclusively to those who only own one encyclopedia
9167432 categorically not i dont know more confusion in the last thirty years than has come from quantum physics
9167433 things start to go horribly wrong and they never recover these folks are trying to give characteristics to emptiness they therefore make it dualistic and then things get worse from there
9167434 we are extremely please to welcome joann to african continuum theatre
9167435 her successful experience and vision and a manager and a leader coupled with her extensive knowledge of washington are valuable assets for the company to grow artistically and operationally
9167436 african continuum theatre has a rich history of fostering and nurturing artists and playwrights and i am committed to building and expanding upon this legacy
9167437 i support my sons independence and i am proud of his decision because he made it for the right reasons to serve his country
9167438 with this quasi draw down there may be shorter deployments which is encouraging for track in fact thats encouraging for all of our troops
9167439 but more likely than not track will end up in the middle east
9167440 i certainly have thought about it the mixed emotions we all feel will be something that binds us together
9167441 but we dont regret that our son or daughter has made this decision
9167442 we want the boys to know that we support them and weve got their backs

9167551 du shells are atrocious radioactive weapons which must never be allowed to use
9167552 r adioactive weapons commit an impermissible crime scattering radioactive materials in the environment
9167553 i realized after only two years at the lab that the culture of nuclear weapons was a culture of insanity what species on earth kills its young generation after generation what species on earth sacrifices its young for the false notion of security
9167554 in 1991 in the first gulf war the united states broke a 60 year taboo and introduced depleted uranium to the battleground a radiological weapon which is truly a weapon of indiscriminate killing and mass destruction now that we know both we must ask a question which is worse the horrific effects of flash annihilation from an atomic bomb or slow mutilation forever from depleted uranium weapons
9167555 such munitions played a major role in the allied victory against saddam husseins armored divisions in the first gulf war and in the peace keeping operations in kosovo in 1999 the department of defense continues to procure depleted uranium munitions as a crucial part of americas defense arsenal in iraq and afghanistan today based largely on these successes

9167557 it has been clearly shown to allow these fine particles that have less than a quarter of a million diameter they measured it and calculated in three weeks how many of these particles would be taken in by a person breathing normally and spending some time outdoors and they calculated that 23 million tiny particles of a quarter million diameter in the concentration that they measure would reach the body and go to the lungs and enter the lymphatic system and produce all kinds of organ damage
9167558 if these particles are small enough that is tinier than a micron which is a millionth of a meter or one ten thousandths of a centimeter if these particles are that small it turns out they are toxic in themselves whatever they are composed of
9167559 thats exactly whats happening in the case of nanoparticles which are produced when the uranium burns upon impact and melts steel and the fine particles are so small they act like a gas so what youre getting is a gas of uranium that gets transported around the world and so what were seeing is an epidemic of all types of conditions that we did not understand that have been in continuous rise in this country in the last 15 years actually since the mid 80s a very consistent rise especially in cancers that are known to be produced by radioactive materials
9167560 in my view use of du weaponry necessarily violates the grave breach provisions of the geneva conventions and hence its use constitutes a war crime or crime against humanity
9167561 even a cursory review of existing norms of the laws and customs of war humanitarian law supports the conclusion that uranium weaponry of any type is so patently illegal that the discussion should really focus on bringing to justice those who have used it and redirecting action towards the victims of these weapons
9167562 w e have to end the use of ammunition that contains uranium in any form

9167588 what we are asking is that there are certain issues which have been drawn in red lines by us because those are the commitments which have been made by our prime minister
9167589 on those red lines we cant because of what we have told parliament these are sacrosanct if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9167590 we have always made this point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust with not because of anything else but because parliament has mandated us to do so
9167591 testing would be difficult for us so we will find ways around it

9167596 the new royalty rates are so high and increasing in the next three years the vast majority pay 008 us cents per song per listener
9167597 a lot of these stations wont make it under the current royalty system
9167598 the board essentially ignored webcasters suggestions and went with a much higher rate
9167599 were hopeful that there will be some action in the new congress next year
9167600 there already has been progress made but its a slow process
9167601 it works really nicely and theyre in the process of launching new features of that product that do it a little differently its kind of a visual representation of what you like and dont like i think theyre going to have a big hit with it
9167602 traditional media need to be focused on internet opportunities just like newspapers going online
9167603 one is whats the model is it a subscription model or advertising model i think subscription models work for a limited amount of listeners but if its going to be mainstream and widely used it needs to be free and ad supported
9167604 if youre a local business that wants to advertise on wfan a new york based all sports station you can do it
9167605 they may buy the zip codes and market to the ones they want i may have a sports bar in l a that wants to reach people interested in sports in in the l a area theyll buy only the listeners who are listening to wfan in l a its a very powerful local medium and and you have to be careful youre not buying the entire station but the local portion of that station
9167606 what it means is you can now put internet radio on your iphone that means you can have internet radio wherever you go i think its highly favorable in terms of revenue growth
9167607 pandora said in the last month that their growth rate was up nearly 40 percent merely because of the iphone
9167608 when you sign up for an account youre putting several data points in there and its all very rich from a targeting perspective
9167609 you can reach people who are listening online the ability to have an audio ad is compelling on online radio because it cuts through the visual noise the people are there listening to music you can reach them in a way you wouldnt have in any other situation
9167610 the opportunity with a pandora is to take all your listeners and be able to target down to the zip code for your in stream audio ads and target different genres people listen to
9167611 i think the growth induced now by the iphone will help them pay that
9167612 secondly i think the growth induced by the iphone will make the labels more willing to accommodate reductions in royalties
9167613 its a great opportunity to listen to internet radio wherever you are
9167614 this is a 20 billion per year business and a big slice of that ad pie will come from mobile radio

9167708 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9167709 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
9167710 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two
9167711 however i believe its more interesting for us to focus on our strengths and quality rather than looking outside i know it makes headlines but it doesnt make you win games

9167713 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
9167714 i suspect theres a part of that in there but the choice for vice president is a lot more important than just picking a characteristic thatll swing a few voters
9167715 john is picking her as a natural successor i dont think gender matters one way or another in how he made his choice
9167716 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9167717 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president
9167718 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9167719 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9167720 i think it was a stab to try and save the ticket by trying to get hillarys supporters to join mccain but it feels kind of like hes forcing them to make a commitment because shes a woman
9167721 i just dont think that its as strong a choice as it could have been
9167722 id have gone with a stronger male ticket than trying to just find a woman any woman to fill the slot i was on the edge with mccain myself this almost pushes me to the other side
9167723 out of the interest in the greater good of her party

9167760 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9167761 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

9167790 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9167791 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9167792 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9167793 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

9167803 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9167804 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9167805 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9167806 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9167807 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9167812 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9167813 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9167814 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9167815 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9167816 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9167817 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9167818 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9167819 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9167820 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9167821 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9167822 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9167823 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9167824 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9167825 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9167826 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado

9167830 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

9167834 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9167835 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9167836 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9167837 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9167838 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9167844 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial

9167944 analyses can always have shortfalls when it comes to predicting cows response to a particular forage but so long as carefully sampled analysis will give a valuable starting point that should be regularly repeated poor knowledge of the dm will mean an inaccurate diet is fed figures are also given for intake potential ip and potential acid load pal both are useful for establishing whether you are on the right track with silage to be able to perform as you would wish

9167954 in february 2001 i was diagnosed with an adenoma in my right parotid gland salivary and was told i had two choices radiation or total parotidectomy i was certainly not open to radiation nor was i very eager for surgery as there is some risk of facial paralysis because four branches of the facial nerve grow through the parotid gland which is located along the jaw area so i began asking around and found that many people are having excellent results healing themselves through raw foods so by march i was eating 100 raw organic foods i also invested in an alkaline water filter since i had read that cancer cannot grow in an alkaline environment and i began taking supplements to boost the immune system within 5 months my tumor completely disappeared the first thing that i did was read a book called i recommend this book to anyone who wants inspiration to go raw and to see clearly how raw foods can heal she healed herself of breast cancer it was very inspiring to me and got me started on a healing regimen immediately upon reading it it reads very easily and is very inspiring

9168035 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
9168036 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases and justifies the current control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies

9168109 no tiene ni tendr ning n tinte partidista pol tico o religioso unicamente buscamos mejorar las condiciones de vida de nuestro m xico
9168110 a zayas no se le pueden atribuir las 12 muertes habr cuando mucho un ejercicio ilegal del servicio p blico as es que nos vamos a ir otra vez al amparo
9168111 yo s que hay mucho encono social por la salida de guillermo pero yo creo que a la tragedia social que es terrible las muertes son terribles no podemos sumarle una tragedia jur dica y pensar que con un chivo expiatorio la justicia se hace en este pa s
9168112 con las aportaciones de varias amistades reunimos la cantidad que hay que pagar de fianza el proceso seguir pero lo importante es que l va a salir de la c rcel y hoy se reunir con sus hijos
9168113 pues vamos a restablecer la civilidad en la universidad de guadalajara el consejo general universitario ya se manifest yo tengo ese mandato de la comunidad universitaria
9168114 es un reto y el estado mexicano tendr que hacer lo posible para cumplir el acuerdo
9168115 no amedrentarnos con ese reto que p blicamente est dando el crimen organizado no s lo con las ejecuciones sino con las narcomantas
9168116 estoy seguro que habr m s y esto debe poner en alerta a todas las fuerzas federales estatales y municipales ellos el crimen organizado buscar n romper reventar el pacto nacional
9168117 la sociedad est en todas las posibilidades de hacer el desbordamiento que sea seguramente habr mucha exigencia
9168118 alerta roja totalmente ya no es mbar como dec an es roja porque no es lo mismo matar a alguien con r fagas de ak47 que decapitarlos la delincuencia organizada es cada vez m s violenta y lo que busca es transmitir miedo y temor no s lo a la sociedad sino tambi n al gobierno
9168119 no sabemos qu nivel tenga la infiltraci n de los cuerpos policiacos creemos que la militarizaci n no es la alternativa ni tampoco en el corto plazo pretender elevar las penas porque estamos ante un hecho real cotidiano y permanente lo que hay que atender es un asunto de emergencia
9168120 necesitamos hacer una limpia total de polic as municipales estatales y federales porque no puede ser que est n colaborando con el crimen organizado
9168121 la actividad ineficaz que se puede ver es que tenemos polic as que se la est n jugando con el crimen y no est n guardando lealtad y disciplina al estado mexicano
9168122 rompamos el miedo y la impotencia la violencia s tiene soluci n
9168123 la marcha es el inicio de muchas acciones y una de ellas tiene que ver con el cambio de actitud como ciudadanos a dejar atr s la corrupci n que alimenta la impunidad y a rescatar los valores que nos han caracterizado como sociedad
9168124 sin que eso implique que los mexicanos nos sintamos dos veces m s seguros
9168125 seguridad ciudadana justicia penal y derechos humanos en m xico
9168126 de que las autoridades no han centrado sus esfuerzos en ese 5 por ciento de los delincuentes que nos han robado la calma
9168127 una pol tica criminal espec fica para cada uno de los diversos tipos de delito contraria a la tendencia legislativa y de pol tica de los ltimos lustros que concibe a la criminalidad como un fen meno homog neo ante el que se proponen soluciones
9168128 secuestros y homicidios a sangre fr a han calado hondo en la sociedad mexicana y han generado indignaci n de acuerdo con encuestas de victimizaci n los mexicanos cada vez denunciamos menos los il citos abrumados por el temor y la desconfianza
9168129 se estima que en m xico s lo se denuncia el 12 por ciento de los delitos de acuerdo con encuestas del instituto ciudadano de estudios sobre la inseguridad icesi
9168130 por ello el desaf o de la delincuencia debe conocerse y analizarse en sus diversos segmentos para emprender diagn sticos particulares de los que se deriven propuestas y pol ticas focalizadas que mejoren la efectividad de las pol ticas de seguridad
9168131 en nuestro contexto social y legal estos delitos ser an homicidio intencional secuestro violaci n delitos contra la salud en modalidades de producci n tr fico transporte o comercio tr fico de armas o personas lavado de dinero robo de veh culo pirater a y contrabando de gran escala as como los robos violentos a casa habitaci n negocio carga pesada bancos y a personas tiene un mayor impacto el robo de 50 pesos con un arma apunt ndonos que el robo electr nico de miles de pesos de nuestra cuenta de banco
9168132 son los delitos que m s tememos y de los que nunca quisi ramos ser v ctimas
9168133 un an lisis de la incidencia delictiva en nuestro pa s nos muestra que durante el 2007 se registraron en m xico aproximadamente 370 mil de estos il citos 22 1 por ciento de las denuncias por otra parte algunos crimin logos subrayan que aproximadamente el 5 por ciento de los delincuentes de una sociedad cometen entre el 55 y 60 por ciento de los delitos graves hay asaltantes que roban diariamente a seis o m s personas y bandas que roban varios veh culos en una noche
9168134 una peque a porci n de los delincuentes y una proporci n minoritaria de los incidentes delictivos son los que m s han contribuido a robarnos la tranquilidad y la seguridad a los mexicanos
9168135 adem s del amplio y sofisticado mbito de operaci n y el poder econ mico de los grandes grupos criminales se ha constatado la fortaleza del tercer pilar de la delincuencia organizada el contubernio del hampa con agentes de la autoridad
9168136 los sucesos recientes nos han puesto frente a la realidad de que no obstante tres lustros de discurso pol tico el saneamiento la profesionalizaci n y el blindaje de la honestidad de los cuerpos polic acos de elite siguen pendientes
9168137 la desconfianza rec proca la intermitencia e inconsistencia de las pol ticas p blicas la politizaci n del tema y la frecuente rotaci n de mandos y directivos han permitido que la inercia y los intereses delictivos aniden y se fortalezcan en el seno de las instituciones que deber an combatir el crimen
9168138 el camino que enmiende este oscuro panorama comienza por el saneamiento de las corporaciones el compromiso de la clase pol tica con pol ticas integrales y sostenidas la protecci n de v ctimas y agentes de la autoridad y el combate a la impunidad actualmente de 98 76 por ciento cidac 2007 y no por el endurecimiento de la legislaci n
9168139 debe basarse en medidas focalizadas y precedidas de intensa inteligencia policial que permitan dedicar m s y mejores recursos a la prevenci n combate y sanci n de los delitos m s violentos y graves que son los que impactan decisivamente la percepci n de inseguridad y el temor en la ciudadan a
9168140 que ni se paren los gobernantes porque esta movilizaci n es contra ellos
9168141 de coraz n les pido a los secuestradores que por favor se comuniquen que no va a haber rencor no va a haber represalias y s recompensa
9168142 todos aquellos que han sufrido una p rdida como la m a y que no tienen acceso a este foro
9168143 es un ejemplo que tenemos que dar a la sociedad no importa a qu te dediques no importa tu especialidad todos tenemos que aportar y ante la polarizaci n que tenemos en el pa s hay objetivos comunes y el tema de seguridad es nuestro objetivo com n
9168144 nuestra rea es el fortalecimiento de la sociedad civil organizada y lo que pueda traer democracia nos conectamos con una red de m s de dos mil organizaciones y cuando nos invitaron a este movimiento aunque no es nuestro tema pues no nos dedicamos a la seguridad decidimos que es algo en que debemos involucrarnos todos
9168145 creemos firmemente que el problema de seguridad por el que atraviesa m xico se debe en parte a la educaci n y decidimos incursionar en este movimiento para presionar y que podamos tener una mayor educaci n c vica y reducir los ndices delictivos
9168146 hemos recibido veladoras cerillos encendedores agua transporte para algunos grupos de personas que van a venir a la marcha en la ciudad de m xico y tambi n han pagado spots en la radio para promocionar la marcha
9168147 solamente conoc a a tres de quienes tambi n participan en la organizaci n de la marcha las dem s asociaciones las hab a escuchado pero lo importante es que hemos dejado a un lado nuestras actividades para unirnos a trabajar en pro de la seguridad y comprometernos a darle seguimiento a ese movimiento
9168148 los ciudadanos decimos ya basta s pero no s lo con un reclamo sino con propuestas concretas que queremos que cumplan que cumplan con unidad sin importar su filiaci n partidista sin importar sus aspiraciones personales o de grupo
9168149 nuestras exigencias se resumen en una frase tener buenas leyes y hacer que se cumplan mediante la reconstrucci n de nuestras instituciones
9168150 estas exigencias pretenden edificar un efectivo sistema de seguridad p blica y justicia penal

9168176 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi faranno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi far uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggi in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e per me il grano inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo il rumore del vento nel grano

9168186 i understand the negotiation on a bimstec fta has been going on quite sometime now while we expected the fta to be concluded and come into effect by july 2006 it is yet to be finalized it is important that we approach the issue with a greater sense of urgency and demonstrate flexibility and accommodation to conclude the agreement without delay
9168187 this is however still at a very initial thinking stage bangladesh will immensely benefit from a road outlet to the east
9168188 there seems to be a growing interest in this idea from these countries as well which is good for us

9168206 i wont bet on it but at least i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia
9168207 if european countries continue carrying out such policies we will have to talk to washington about european matters
9168208 there is now better understanding at every level amongst the government functionaries and realization amongst the people of the area towards the ground realities as far as fata is concerned
9168209 we have to look into the affairs of this organization of vital importance with some more details not only to ensure proper implementation on development projects but also to make its working result oriented
9168210 what we are asking is that there are certain issues which have been drawn in red lines by us because those are the commitments which have been made by our prime minister
9168211 on those red lines we cant because of what we have told parliament these are sacrosanct if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9168212 we have always made this point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust with not because of anything else but because parliament has mandated us to do so

9168225 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9168226 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9168227 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9168228 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag

9168233 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
9168234 thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created
9168235 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
9168236 and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god
9168237 even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him
9168238 bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word

9168240 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares
9168241 and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
9168242 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
9168243 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
9168244 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
9168245 and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth
9168246 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods
9168247 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own

9168254 it takes a very unique guy as a quarterback in your offense to walk out of the huddle and let someone else come into the huddle especially in the red zone and finish a drive

9168297 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
9168298 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases and justifies the current control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies

9168308 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9168309 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9168310 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9168311 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9168312 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9168313 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9168314 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini

9168317 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9168318 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9168319 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9168320 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9168321 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9168326 futures in november five loads two weeks before thanksgiving lets talk price
9168327 so you want to do a contract a set price act of god clause the whole nine yards
9168328 no no you dont understand its futures i buy em you sell em any time between now amp november which is expiration i have the option to sell em back to you at whatever the market will bear and buddy boy i plan to make a profit i think you skated by on hurricane season last year this year you wont be so lucky
9168329 i think youre completely out of your mind you been getting into the patron again
9168330 nope sober as a judge but this is the coming thing when all the young mba types come into the business theyre gonna be doing this why shouldnt we have a leg up on em
9168331 when those mba types as you say come into the business itll be time for me to get out and run away very fast the contract deal is bad enough theyre made to be broken this cockamamie thing would have people shooting each other
9168332 ok ok i just thought you were more forward thinking than i guess you are
9168333 hey just kidding just wanted to activate your mind a little and see if youre gonna make it up here for a night or two before you have to go back down south
9168334 we feel that foundation for industry talent conveys our mission more effectively than our former name
9168335 we are indeed dedicated to education of the produce industrys labor talent but more importantly we are dedicated to a broader spectrum of attracting developing and retaining superior talent to sustain a vibrant global produce supply chain
9168336 food safety in the 21st century marketplace best practices throughout the supply chain
9168337 i think that the initial investigation into this outbreak considered a wide range of different possibilities that had been described as a source of salmonella or that seemed likely at the time the initial set of hypothesis generating interviews was conduced that asked people among other things whether they had eaten green bell peppers red bell peppers or other types of peppers they did not go down an exhaustive list of all the other types of peppers what was thought to be a relatively small proportion of those people answered yes to each of the peppers on the basis of that the whole case control investigation was developed based on the most common foods that were reported by the people who had been ill and thats one that identified a strong association with tomatoes and also did not find an association with either eating salsa or guacamole which were were also popular foods there were mentioned commonly i think if an association had been found with eating salsa or guacamole in the first investigation attention might have focused more on all the ingredients of salsa or guacamole but since there was not a specific association with salsa or guacamole in that first investigation or a risk identified separately from that of tomatoes that was where the investigation took us
9168338 i think that the epidemiological and laboratory information is very strong for jalapeno peppers and also strong for the serrano peppers which means we are now talking about two different food vehicles with culture confirmations the information about tomatoes was from the early study time period and it was more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory finding behind it
9168339 the traceback requirements are complex as you point out we are exploring various options the agency is planning a public meeting in the fall october or november time frame to consult further with the stakeholders and those who are interested in this

9168363 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9168372 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9168373 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

9168382 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9168383 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9168384 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia

9168406 he didnt take that attitude and resumed doing the things he loved to do
9168407 my intention is to add a little more of a personal twist about my father his personality the quick wit that he had and how his sense of humor really helped him through his illness
9168408 when i think of my dad i think of a spiritual giant
9168409 that song represented his lifes desire i believe he kept his eyes on the lord since his teen years

9168612 this abandoned warehouse is part of the history of the place there are a lot of buildings like this in the area neither restored nor preserved most of these buildings will eventually be demolished a lot of people in the area are saying that all of the new construction is going to encroach upon these buildings including the ones where people live a lot of people are concerned about this as contractors take control of these areas without really giving a thought to the existing the community and the people that have been living there for years
9168613 these condos were built about a year ago a lot of people when they see the photo ask me if this building was photographed in florida to me the building just appeared our of nowhere like a mirage it just sits there in the middle of absolutely nothing the area is totally empty but all of that area is going to be redeveloped

9168617 in this project ive tried to use saturated colors and compelling skies so that the image jumps out at you the juxtaposition of these amazing skies with the industrial landscape creates a surreal effect
9168618 im working on a photography book right now which i hope to publish during the coming year aside from the cover the whole book will be made sustainably printed on bamboo paper put together by hand in general i try to print my photos on paper made out of bamboo fiber and i do a lot of my work by hand such as the framing making cards etc this cuts quite a bit of the co2 out of the process

9169001 the love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our being it is also the most true to our nature
9169002 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
9169003 freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise
9169004 you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do

9169008 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
9169009 the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
9169010 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel
9169011 the only truly consistent man is he who will for the sake of being right today contradict what he said wrong yesterday

9169016 it is not a mistake to have strong views the mistake is to have nothing else

9169020 while we are free to do whatever we wish we are not free to have the consequences be whatever we want them to be
9169021 one of the many failings of our educational system is that it sends out into the world people who cannot tell rhetoric from reality
9169022 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
9169023 every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world
9169024 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
9169025 sin can play a big role in making and keeping us humble a contrite spirit is desired by god in order for me to be contrite i must embrace the good and the bad in me and not take either too seriously

9169033 the reason i chose islamic relief is quite simple they are apolitical by that i mean they do not have an ulterior agenda something you cant say about all charities for them creed race ethnicity and nationality are not an issue
9169034 more artists from the middle east are associating themselves with charities because the arts world is not disconnected from society therefore it must reflect the society it exists in the muslim world is going through many hardships and so its important to select ambassadors that represent those societies if the art world fails to represent those concerns then it fails as a medium of communication
9169035 islamic relief opened so many doors for me exposed me to realities through them i went to darfur and visited refugee camps i went to their offices in khartoum without islamic relief i would not have been able to highlight the hardships in gaza the closing of the borders check points and the lack of facilities and necessities in that part of the world which is always in the news but rarely accurately they made it easier for me to go to regions that i would undoubtedly have been unable to visit by myself

9169197 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9169198 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kind of cases
9169199 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9169200 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9169201 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9169202 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics

9169205 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9169206 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9169207 it got to the point where the dollars were just too much for us
9169208 we thought it was at a point where we werent going to be able to do it i wasnt able to make the adjustment with my salary structure
9169209 the last two years meszaros play has left a lot to be desired i know filip kuba well and hes really going to help us i know hes excited about this change as for picard hes local guy with a lot of potential we feel good and the first round pick is also going to help us
9169210 in present day america such a choice is a rarity
9169211 palin is known for her talent of riding the snowmobile and for being an enthusiastic hunter and fisher
9169212 for a man who is 72 and has been afflicted with cancer four times to choose someone who is so completely and utterly unqualified to become president this is shockingly irresponsible
9169213 with the choice of sarah palin governor of alaska as running mate mccain tries to get hillarys clintons angry supporters on his side
9169214 with a rebellious streak who takes almost a child like pleasure in leaving the world and also friends and close colleagues behind in complete surprise

9169235 in the past 25 years training and education have become more and more important as a path to economic security
9169236 theres been no definitive word on that just what youve heard on the news and weve heard similar thing informally as well that there may be if the need arises that there may be some rescheduling of appearance at the convention or parts of the convention if theres a need for president bush or others to stay focused on the situation with the hurricane in the southern united states
9169237 i think if it becomes a huge disaster i think it would be totally appropriate to delay the convention first things first and peoples lives come ahead of politics
9169238 if there are people suffering on the gulf coast we want to be sensitive to their plight and make sure we respond accordingly
9169239 being good planners every option is being looked at every scenario is being studied and i think there will be some game time decisions as to if there will be any adjustments to our plans
9169240 that while we intend to gavel the convention to order on monday afternoon our convention places country first and ensuring the safety of our citizens is of paramount importance
9169241 we have officers here who are on loan to us from numerous departments well over 100 different departments are represented for this event and the idea that they could just stay for an extra week or two im thinking their chiefs would have something to say about that it probably wouldnt be a fun conversation
9169242 you certainly have the right and ability to bring those concerns through the appropriate authorities if you like you can certainly call the department of safety or the minnesota state patrol next tuesday when we have open hours
9169243 we all knew this year would be hard and traumatic if we have another year like this you ll not have a harris tweed industry there will be no weavers
9169244 they are on the breadline if the situation is not as serious as it is you would not have the minister coming here to solve the problem
9169245 i don t think it is unreasonable to expect a full time weaver to earn 25 000 pounds a year but the tweed is selling at primark prices it is being sold at 16 pounds a metre while it needs to be more like 25 pounds a metre
9169246 there has been significant investment by harris tweed companies in recent years this points to an industry which already knows it must do all it can to compete in the global textiles market
9169247 i believe that this problem will only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation
9169248 the very positive contribution that this sector makes to employment is of utmost importance to our vision of shared and equitable growth this sector provides employment to over 42 million people it contributes about 45 per cent of the total manufacturing output and nearly 40 per cent of india s exports it is the capacity of this sector to generate economic activity at the local level that prompted gandhiji to give the pride of place to khadi he dreamt of an india comprising of self contained villages using local raw materials local skills serving local markets and providing employment to people locally near the places where they live
9169249 this sector has shown continued dynamism in terms of growth in the number of enterprises production and the capacity to contribute to manufacturing output and exports there were apprehensions about the impact of liberalization on the growth of this sector however experience during the past decade has amply demonstrated that this sector cannot only survive competition but can also grow faster than the overall manufacturing sector this demonstrates the high degree of resilience entrepreneurial skills and the capacity for adaptation of people operating in this important sector
9169250 president mikheil saakashvili of georgia has acted stupidly to put it mildly but we must also take into account how massive the russian provocations were
9169251 moscow supported the aims of separatists russian troops were placed in position at the start of summer russian jets deliberately flew over georgian territory parts of georgian territory are still occupied
9169252 we czechs have been made to learn by our history that fearfulness does not pay appeasement is no alternative
9169253 we have to make unambiguously clear there will be no return to business as usual with the european union before russia withdraws its troops from georgia
9169254 we have to demonstrate to russian president dimitry medvedev and russian prime minister vladimir putin how much damage they are doing to their own country

9169260 extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
9169261 this is not a protest led by hatred rancour and anger but by the teachings of the lord buddha to refrain from harming others
9169262 our condolence and homage to those who lost their lives and those who were imprisoned tortured and beaten in the recent uprisings in tibet
9169263 tibetans from nepal would like to send the message to the whole world that all tibetans want peace and freedom in tibet
9169264 tim pawlenty is like a skipper of a ship thats in rocky seas
9169265 things have gone kind of haywire in the water but somehow hes able to keep a pretty steady level of support among minnesotans during a period when there are some real challenges and a period in which the campaigns are clearly starting to pick up speed and become a little rougher
9169266 what were seeing is that carol molnau would have her hands full in building and enjoying the confidence of minnesotans and of obviously the legislature
9169267 it appears that she would come in as a fairly weak governor and one who will face some real challenges she is not tim pawlenty
9169268 molnau would come in as a fairly weak governor and one who will face some real challenges she is not tim pawlenty
9169269 its a position thats a little more behind the scenes so the people of minnesota and i think the poll reflects that theres still a pretty large percentage of minnesotans that dont really have an opinion or dont feel they know her well enough to state
9169270 they are also i think reacting to the fact that weve had two very productive legislative sessions where weve focused on issues like energy independence the economy jobs education and health care
9169271 and its pretty clear from the poll that minnesotans trust democrats to deal with these issues
9169272 if you took the top 25 to 30 races in the state i think youd see were doing very well
9169273 our polling data shows we are doing well in the races that are competitive

9169275 i know there were some things written about me being injured i dont know where that came from because i wasnt injured
9169276 maybe my left ankle is not the greatest but i was more than fine to play how much i played was really a coachs decision
9169277 i had a game plan for myself but i guess it wasnt the same as the coachs plan my playing had nothing to do with my ankle it was just how the coach made the lineup
9169278 around the country no judges are staying up late awaiting the final appeals from the condemned
9169279 governors and justices of the supreme court are not worrying that the person about to be executed may be the exceptional one who is innocent prison guards family members of victims and of death row inmates and even the media are relieved of the tension and uncertainty that each pending execution brings
9169280 but much of the death penalty system remains unaffected by this hold on executions
9169281 prosecutions trials appeals and the rituals of death row continue to absorb an enormous share of the judicial systems time and resources justices from some of the states highest courts have complained about the extraordinary strain this one issue places on the bench in many states there are not enough qualified lawyers willing to handle the appeals
9169282 the time for a dispassionate impartial comparison of the enormous costs that death penalty litigation imposes on society with the benefits that it produces has surely arrived
9169283 what i am now doing is broadening my party to have greater confidence on welfare issues our strongholds are the economy and jobs but it will now also be welfare issues if you hold these three you can win the election
9169284 the strategy we are using is frontloaded reform and then from a position of strong public finances to introduce more reforms over the next two years

9169288 probably playing the wacken festival in germany in 2001 that was amazing
9169289 not taking time to work through our problems personally i should have been more patient looking back on that time i was pretty young and naive i was not mature enough to deal with the stresses of road life and band life in general but i believe we all had a hand in our demise when you get right down to it

9169313 in a pluralistic postmodern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
9169314 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
9169315 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed
9169316 they believe everyone has an equal chance at this life and the next
9169317 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
9169318 and i was supposed to be in love with you
9169319 ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
9169320 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives
9169321 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
9169322 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
9169323 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
9169324 for me in songs like losing my ground and voodoo doll i was able to be vulnerable and let people into a subject that a lot of celebrities would just try to hide
9169325 plus being with the guys is like having all these big brothers its not so much about me its about unity and group union i love being part of a team and i love having an outlet where i can sing something about my personal life that would be too self indulgent on a group record
9169326 she rejected the bridge to nowhere the famous earmark for a span from ketchikan to an island of 50 people
9169327 palin not consistent candidate sometimes gives different answers to questions
9169328 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9169329 maybe if we had done it right maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country
9169330 maybe the 200 000 people who cross that bridge every day would have been safer than spending 233 million of your tax dollars on a bridge in alaska to an island with 50 people on it
9169331 the protests against mr samaks government are being led by a conservative group called the peoples alliance for democracy pad
9169332 a front for the exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra
9169333 pad was originally formed in the months before the 2006 coup to demand mr thaksins resignation it has re emerged now that the country is being led by his former ally mr samak
9169334 all of that has been done the bank issued an

9169416 the team gb performance in beijing showed us just how much we can achieve together if we are united not divided
9169417 arguments about preserving individual nationality are frankly a bit of a smokescreen there have been a number of direct assurances from sepp blatter that individual nations will not be affected by coming together for the olympic games in 2012
9169418 an olympics in britain is a once in a career opportunity so lets let go of the petty politics and just get on with the game
9169419 it was almost impossible to notice football matches played at beijing the reason it is simply not a football competition
9169420 an event which should be the pinnacle of every sportsman and sportswomans career does not represent that where football comes into it
9169421 scotland wales england and northern ireland have always been autonomous where football is concerned and that is the way it should remain
9169422 there is no argument i have heard which over rides what eventual damage could be done to each country by a united team

9169427 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9169428 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9169429 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9169430 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9169431 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9169432 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9169433 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9169434 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9169435 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9169436 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9169437 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9169438 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9169439 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9169440 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9169441 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9169442 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9169443 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9169444 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9169445 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9169446 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9169447 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9169448 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9169449 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9169450 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9169451 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9169452 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9169453 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9169454 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9169455 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9169456 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9169457 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9169458 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9169459 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9169460 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9169461 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9169462 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9169463 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9169464 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9169465 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9169466 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9169467 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9169468 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9169469 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9169470 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9169471 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9169472 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9169473 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9169474 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9169475 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9169476 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9169477 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9169478 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9169479 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9169480 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9169481 who are open to doing something on the production side
9169482 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9169483 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9169484 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9169485 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9169486 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9169487 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9169488 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9169489 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9169490 je suis grosse jai pris dix kilos en un jour je suis un boudin

9169495 the city of brownsville is currently conducting the necessary environmental review for the possible purchase of this building
9169496 the possible purchase and future use of this building is contingent on the conclusion of these documents
9169497 nutcase mansion would be blaming the failures of community institutions on a structure
9169498 i feel that the building is getting a death sentence for the crimes of its occupants
9169499 i think that it should be made into offices for child protective services
9169500 people said they used to hear noises babies crying at night
9169501 i dont hear those things and i stay up late
9169502 the applicant would have 30 days to appeal our decision to the city commission but nobodys coming in to save that house
9169503 im sure if we put 50 people in a room and asked them whether we should demolish it 25 would immediately say yes but if you asked them if we should instead use it to house an organization that helps children theyd probably agree with that too
9169504 and that was packed with asbestos a worst case scenario i think that their number was plucked out of thin air

9169511 the god of the quran is not the same god as the holy bible
9169512 ik heb via de pers moeten vernemen dat ik geen renner voor eendagswedstrijden ben
9169513 mijn ploeg was niet welkom in de tour de france en daardoor had ik me volledig kunnen focussen op de olympische spelen
9169514 in andere landen worden renners gekozen door ex profs niet door functionarissen die er niks van kennen
9169515 losada ontkent dat hij zei dat hij hier ongelukkig is
9169516 en kruiswijks vriendin kocht geen ticket voor cercle anderlecht in het cercle vak
9169517 en zo zijn er meer verhalen geweest met al die miserie hebben we niet veel kunnen trainen ik leek het ocmw wel
9169518 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9169519 there is no question we are taking this storm seriously
9169520 i am absolutely sure that the city and state is much better prepared than they were before
9169521 people themselves are also better prepared because theyve gone through it
9169522 from a city standpoint were significantly head of the game as far as planning
9169523 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9169524 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9169525 the allegations surfaced during the investigation but we had to do our due diligence
9169526 caseys attorney jose baez diligently tried to contact authorities to surrender his client
9169527 the arrest and the drama at the anthony home tonight only added insult upon injury for the family of the kidnapped child
9169528 indicated to the airport the possibility of replacing the plane with another

9169533 i was up at 5 a m today and i was crying
9169534 if it wasnt for the march and a lot of the activity it would be a downer
9169535 i dont have confidence in the levee system so really were at the mercy of god
9169536 we dont wish anything bad on anybody else but were praying it misses new orleans and goes somewhere else
9169537 i always watch the weather channel and try to see which way its going to go
9169538 im not worried about anything but getting us out of here safely
9169539 clearly served notice that this campaign is going to wage a strong effort for women voters
9169540 another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in politics
9169541 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9169542 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9169543 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9169544 why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin
9169545 they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9169546 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate
9169547 he said that the mccain palin ticket is very strong he wished her good luck told her that she will be a fantastic vice presidential candidate and that he is looking forward to a great victory in november
9169548 shes not someone who has millions and millions of dollars
9169549 this is a tough smart person who can relate to the average joe
9169550 she is going to energize the republican party at that convention
9169551 shes new shes fresh theyre going to like her and theyre going to believe her
9169552 i think shes more representative of the future of the republican party
9169553 ive never had problems with my other pregnancies so i was shocked
9169554 it took a while to open up the book that the doctor gave me about children with down syndrome
9169555 i dont think there was ever a question that they were going to have the baby
9169556 i was just your average hockey mom in alaska coaching some basketball on the side
9169557 my agenda was to stop wasteful spending cut property taxes and put the people first
9169558 i think she is a person who holds her principles very near and dear
9169559 it seems her vindictiveness is whats gotten her into trouble with this trooper out here
9169560 what ive seen in private is what you see in public
9169561 i think her faith and her integrity are both very real
9169562 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
9169563 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
9169564 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
9169565 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
9169566 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
9169567 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
9169568 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
9169569 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
9169570 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
9169571 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
9169572 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
9169573 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9169574 i would rather hear you say that at the end of the trial rather than the beginning
9169575 and now that im talking to you i feel blood freezing in my veins
9169576 in my mind i saw my son my husband and 22 members of my family that were killed in srebrenica
9169577 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
9169578 i sincerely hope you are not serious about that date
9169579 de russen zijn georgi binnengevallen om ons land te vernietigen
9169580 wij hopen dat er ook bij een volledige overname door lufthansa in belgi geen jobs verloren zullen gaan
9169581 gezien de huidige economische conjunctuur en de dure olieprijzen kunnen dergelijke garanties door vrijwel geen enkel luchtvaartbedrijf ook niet door brussels airlines geboden worden
9169582 brussels airlines stelt alles in het werk om een gezond businessmodel te behouden een alliantie met een andere luchtvaartmaatschappij een strikte controle van de kosten en een stijging van de inkomsten staan centraal in deze strategie
9169583 de russen zijn georgi binnengevallen om ons land te vernietigen
9169584 elke week keek ik uit naar wie er nu weer op nummer 1 zou staan
9169585 ik draaide de hit op 78 toeren waardoor het effect eerder komisch was ik werd door de openbare omroep bestraft en stapte toen zelf op
9169586 maar elke nieuwe generatie vindt de weg naar de top 30
9169587 what separates her from others is that at a time when republicans have suffered from the taint of corruption she represents clean politics
9169588 the public stereotype of a republican is a wrinkled old guy taking cash under the table one way for republicans to break the stereotype is with a female reformer
9169589 the biggest political gamble i think just about in american political history
9169590 i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9169591 a blue collar conservative woman who will excite the republican party and lay out the welcome mat for independents and disaffected clinton voters
9169592 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team
9169593 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9169594 and a running mate is not going to matter with women voters
9169595 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9169596 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9169597 shows that theyre making a concerted effort to go after women voters who are upset that barack obama passed over hillary clinton
9169598 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9169599 but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9169600 i know it will demand the best i have to give and i promise nothing less
9169601 i had promised todd a little surprise for the anniversary present
9169602 i havent met her before but she seems like a compelling person
9169603 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9169604 the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course sen hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign hillary left 18 million cracks in the hardest glass ceiling in america the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9169605 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9169606 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9169607 actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9169608 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9169609 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans
9169610 unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9169611 proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
9169612 it shows perhaps that hes a bit of a gambler that he was willing at this stage to roll the dice
9169613 its a tremendous risk to take someone of this little experience
9169614 shows that theyre making a concerted effort to go after women voters who are upset that barack obama passed over hillary clinton
9169615 a quintessential john mccain pick shes someone whos a reformer someone whos been a maverick
9169616 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9169617 im used to being very productive and working real hard and in administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question

9169619 if theres a big rain event ambulances may have a problem getting to us
9169620 theyre setting themselves up for a nightmare that area floods way more so than where charity was
9169621 if the streets flood we cant get to them with the things they need
9169622 we have everything in the hospital that we need to run it
9169623 were really focusing on a group of our folks committed to staying in the hospial and working in shifts during the storm
9169624 for 20 years we have been preparing for the perfect storm
9169625 all of our generators are on the third floor or above
9169626 for katrina we had to use a football field at the high school next door to land copters
9169627 we will discharge as many kids a possible before the storm
9169628 im not leaving camerons side i will hunker down with him on storm night
9169629 the hospital has changed a lot of things since katrina the nurses doctors and surgeons nurse have been in direct contact with me letting me know what to expect its really comforting because the cardiac specialty team stays here in the storm and camerons cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon live within walking distance a couple blocks from the hospital
9169630 patients have been calling to find dialysis clinics in the areas they are going to evacuate to
9169631 and believe me i will find a place in this book to get to for dialysis
9169632 they will automatically have my medical records there im not worried about the hurricane honey
9169633 we have a plan in place to assist those patients
9169634 we realize babies have their own timetable and will continue to be born patients suffering with chest pain and possible heart attacks will continue to present to our emergency room and require special procedures
9169635 we are getting a lot of calls from patients whose family members are outside of this area and want reassurance that their relative will be all right
9169636 we have people coming in every day still wanting to get in for this year
9169637 we had 250 to 300 applications for those spots and were still getting applications
9169638 religion is important because it is the glue that holds us together

9169643 minimalism and austerity in dance music work best as counterpoints to more ebullient fare a short salty shock to set the scene for the climax to come or to open up space for you mind to go wandering but now minimal techno rarely plays off against anything else it
9169644 i cant imagine berlin techno returning to the fairground but perhaps a possible way out of the inertia is by exacerbating the cultures own vices anal precision decadence a certain sentimentality the feeling of living in a city of scars and wastes until they become virtues
9169645 minimal might be characterised as nomadalgia a lack of sense of place a drift through club or salon spaces that like franchise coffee bars could be anywhere

9169658 culture is an essential part of conflict and conflict resolution cultures are like underground rivers that run through our lives and relationships giving us messages that shape our perceptions attributions judgments and ideas of self and other though cultures are powerful they are often unconscious influencing conflict and attempts to resolve conflict in imperceptible ways

9169666 addictions often rob people of their appreciation of things whether its food sex shopping whatever what was supposed to fill the hole within us didnt and it always leaves us wanting more
9169667 lust over time will always lead to despair which always leads to anger lust always leads to anger

9169675 faith is really taking the risk of moving when god calls me into the realm of the unknown and unseen and only dimly understood it means that i may have to give up my closely held control of my life and destiny my fate and my future a thought alarming enough to keep some of us from moving at all

9169819 mccain had to protect his reputation as an opponent of status quo washington he had to pick someone with the shortest washington r sum he did that he picked someone the right wing is going to be happy about but its a gamble

9169822 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9169823 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9169824 a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not joe biden

9169833 theres this assumption that men and women come into divorce on equal footing and thats just not the case
9169834 divorce became much more civilized people could focus on what was important they didnt have to fall on the sword to get a divorce

9169840 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall

9169845 obama gave a great speech of course i wanted a woman i would have liked to see hillary be the candidate
9169846 he was able to get specific and attack his opponent but in a very careful way

9169868 in the months afterward we saw dramatic declines in local elk populations up to 40 percent loss in some areas because so much winter range was decimated so late in the year it showed us how not to conduct prescribed burns but mostly it was a vivid example of what can happen to elk when crucial habitat is suddenly lost and that led directly to our concern for protecting habitat from wildfire as well as subdivisions and other land use changes

9169911 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9169912 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9169913 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9169914 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there

9169924 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9169925 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9169926 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9169927 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9169928 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9169929 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9169930 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9169931 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9169932 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9169933 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9169934 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9169935 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9169936 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9169937 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9169938 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9169939 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9169940 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9169941 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9169942 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9169943 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9169944 no one works for someone we all just work together
9169945 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9169946 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9169947 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9169948 falls es erforderlich sein sollte werden dabei die dfb rechtsgremien sofort ermittlungen einleiten und ihre entscheidungen treffen dar ber hinaus werden dfb und ligaverband wie in der vergangenheit auch die zust ndigen strafverfolgungsbeh rden auf wunsch bei ihrer arbeit unterst tzen
9169949 eventuelle spielmanipulationen mit der notwendigen konsequenz geahndet werden k nnen in den aktuellen f llen werde daher zeitnah alles was an belegbaren fakten zusammen getragen werden kann gewissenhaft von dfb und dfl berpr ft
9169950 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9169951 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9169952 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9169953 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9169954 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9169955 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9169956 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9169957 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9169958 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9169959 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9169960 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

9169963 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9169964 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9169965 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9169966 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9169967 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9169968 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9169969 une volont de d passer les anciens clivages sest d gag e

9169975 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9169976 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9169977 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9169978 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9169979 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9169980 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9169981 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9169982 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9169983 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9169984 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9169985 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9169986 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9169987 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9169988 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9169989 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9169990 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9169991 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9169992 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9169993 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9169994 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9169995 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9169996 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9169997 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9169998 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9169999 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
