8680199 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8680200 for me the web is a little bit siloed for a lot of users
8680201 there are all of these actions you normally take but you have to go all over the web to do them even something as simple as seeing something online and wanting to send it to yourself or someone else as an sms short message service right now thats a pretty painful experience lots of clicking lots of trundling
8680202 we have the rudimentary systems of structured natural language commands you can select something and ubiq command the software to translate this to french or e mail it to jono in both cases ubiquity is smart enough to realize what this and it refers to as well as knowing who jono is by talking with my web mails contact list
8680203 its also smart enough to be able to understand commands like map chicago comics and yelp tapas near sf and give you rich previews and search results to get you where you want to be quickly even better both of those commands let you insert results directly into say an e mail youre writing so that you never have to interrupt your chain of thought
8680204 its not yet there but it is targeted for everyone to be able to use it right now ubiquity is a 0 1 alpha prototype experiment that isnt ready for everyone
8680205 in 0 2 and on the focus there is getting the community to innovate from the edges to start making interfaces that work well for the general population that might be by being put in the awesome bar the developer of the awesome bar started looking at this

8680217 its like jennifer is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past jennifer shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8680218 since john said it was he who broke off their four month romance jennifer has kept a stiff upper lip and let her actions do the talking making sure everyone sees her smiling and looking sexy
8680219 jennifer was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8680220 id met kim but i really got to know her in our wrestling scene theres hair pulling and i hurt my back and got some burn marks but its also sexy were sort of playing with the idea that guys get turned on by girls wrestling
8680221 we get into some down and dirty positions so its a good thing we became friends kim is so cool not to mention being hot
8680222 ive sort of created that image but its definitely a part of who i am one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in mini skirts and high heels twenty four seven and go to the gym in heels
8680223 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it

8680227 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
8680228 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot

8680237 the 15 000 what reporters are doing at the democratic national convention
8680238 14 000 are wearing terrible suits 7 500 arent doing much at all this isnt surprising only a small number of reporters actually have a reason to be here the rest are conventioneering seeing old friends eating democratic themed menu items barack obamas turkey chili in pandering local restaurants brandishing their press passes at all comers looking for free things and spending about 14 percent of their time trying to rustle up enough stories to justify their presence to their editors 4 021 are smugly bad mouthing the convention and its participants there is no reason for so many journalists to be here 2 294 are bitching about only having perimeter press passes the press corps is divided into four levels of access perimeter arena hall and floor arena hall and floor passes are allowed to enter the pepsi center those with perimeter passes are restricted to the parking lot some of these are mournfully wandering around like diogenes looking for stories or perhaps discarded arena and hall passes but only finding sunburn others have tried to sneak into the pepsi center only to be rebuffed by the robustly efficient young dem robot security staffers the rest are crammed into four or five huge white tents scattered across the parking lot the tents house the remote operations of most of the news operations in pavilion four there is free coors and free swedish meatballs and a kiosk where media members can have campaign buttons made featuring their own names there are also several comfortable leather chairs and flat screen televisions during hillary clintons speech several women clap when clinton thanks the sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits one of these women is wearing a button that reads vote jeanne president 1 026 are drunk this is as it should be 500 dont have credentials but are trying desperately to get them 340 are confused about how to find the proper press office inside the pepsi center there are different press rooms with euphonic names like radio row and talk show row many of the broadcast journalists are stationed on the uppermost floor of the arena in what is probably the press box during regular operation unaffiliated journalists are stashed on a being john malkovich style semi floor in the buildings mysterious middle the unaffiliated press center is a large oblong room featuring several large oblong tables no wireless access and dozens of reporters for small and desperate outlets everybody here looks vaguely depressed or aggravated possibly because the room was so difficult to find one indignant woman in a pink blazer is desperately trying to find somewhere to have a cigarette they told me i had to go downstairs to have a smoke she said shaking her head violently as if she is about to abandon all caution and light up in the press elevator she steps out onto the unaffiliated level can i have a smoke here she asks she cannot the blogger lounge is appended to the unaffiliated press room its lounge credentials apparently hinge on the fact that it has sofas seven of them are having their photographs taken with captain morgan the rum loving pirate who for some reason was credentialed into the convention captain morgan wears a red frock coat and a frilly shirt and sounds like he was once told in a high school acting class to project his voice from his diaphragm one of them is frantically trying to engineer a meeting between captain morgan and ted sorenson the painfully dignified democratic legend who is finishing an interview with tavis smiley just as captain morgan bursts into the tent t shirts and morganettes in tow that person is me and in this i am a failure but then again we are all sort of failures here
8680239 faced with europes dramatic security crisis the irish position looks increasingly preposterous viewed from the perspective of gori or tskhinvali irish misgivings about neutrality rather pale into insignificance lisbon gives the european union the wherewithal to do good in world affairs if ireland really wants to play no part in that effort it should say so and depart
8680240 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together in the twin cities because these days they are awfully hard to tell apart
8680241 these earthquakes are too far offshore to be felt on land and too small to generate a tsunami
8680242 these announcements which may or may not be true are bargaining chips and means for intimidation
8680243 they are basically lying a common tactic i saw it on the part of the iranians sometimes you can believe them sometimes you cant but they are very convincing when they try to persuade you
8680244 this business about closing the strait of hormuz everyones always talking about the iranian threat to strait of hormuz and to our shipping passage its not going to happen
8680245 it would be beyond cutting off your nose to spite your face
8680246 iranians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait of hormuz for last 40 years
8680247 the time when they actually did block the strait the iranians had not made any threats there is of course the possibility that they might do something and the u s navy has certainly been busy trying to do something about that
8680248 iranian conventional military capability is not very good due to age lack of investment so theyve put their resources into asymmetrical capability
8680249 so when something blows up they can say hey it wasnt me but of course it was
8680250 ahmadinejad keeps on advertising look at what we have today na na na na but big deal
8680251 if iran would take on the u s it would lose automatically and thats understood by them
8680252 they are saying the same thing as the french about shifting their energy resources to nuclear power actually its also quite similar to mccains energy policy
8680253 space development is really supporting the strategic development of ballistic missiles
8680254 why does any country develop long range ballistic missiles except for weapons of mass destruction you dont thats the concern
8680255 you dont build missiles to launch firecrackers you build missiles to build nuclear warheads to wipe everybody out
8680256 theyre making progress in area that has very ominous meaning to it how long will it be before they unleash what they really have
8680257 who is responsible for betraying the judiciary zardari is zardari is

8680259 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8680260 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8680261 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8680262 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8680263 we are distressed by the reports we see of health care simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay we see that throughout low and middle income countries
8680264 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention

8680267 for the past six years military relations between the united states and afghanistan have been governed by a two page diplomatic note giving u
8680268 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u
8680269 civilian casualties long a recurring problem in afghanistan tripled last year as thinly spread u s and nato forces grew more dependent on air power against a resurgent taliban
8680270 according to the u s air forces central combined air and space operations center the number of strikes this year in which munitions were dropped totaled 2 368 as of aug 4 the equivalent number for the same period in iraq was 783
8680271 american military officials sought on wednesday to refute claims that as many as 90 civilians among them 60 children were killed in airstrikes on a village in western afghanistan last friday
8680272 in the face of an investigation by afghan officials and a report by a united nations team that support the high number of deaths united states officials maintain that 25 militants and 5 civilians were killed in airstrikes called in after afghan and american commandos came under heavy fire during a raid on the compound of a top taliban commander
8680273 the political and diplomatic consequences of the attack have been mounting by the day with the government of president hamid karzai using the episode to demand greater coordination between afghan and allied forces
8680274 thats what we are expecting and we are planning to give passage a safe area for them to come out of that
8680275 sovereignty as you know is not an abstract notion it conveys a source of authority and protection

8680278 if you sat in the pub with him you wouldnt know he was worth the money he was

8680280 he didnt throw it in your face but he was a successful businessman he just fitted in with everybody whether you were a prince or a pauper
8680281 the administrators were attempting to negotiate with someone mr foster whom they knew to be bereft of the basic instincts of commercial morality

8680285 im here for darren because i believe he would make a superb member of congress this is an easy one to support him
8680286 hes got the same kind of background i have a law enforcement background this is someone who has tremendous experience the kind of person that you need at a time in which safety and security is critical
8680287 certainly isnt a strong supporter of the military wants to raise taxes wants to increase government spending
8680288 has three central new mexico sheriffs testifying to his support for law enforcement not a high paid republican lobbyist from
8680289 hes a republican who has worked with democrats in fact hes gotten in trouble with our party for doing that
8680290 i think hes somebody that democrats particularly those who are somewhat disillusioned with sen obama i think hes somebody they could vote for
8680291 i believe congress is in need of more members like me with an agricultural perspective since all americans rural suburban and urban rely on american farmers and ranchers for food clothing and increasingly fuel each and every day
8680292 i will work to protect the farm safety net lessen government regulation of american agriculture eliminate the death tax and expand opportunities for the st
8680293 during his time in the general assembly luetkemeyer had a 100 voting record on farm bureau issues
8680294 he was awarded the friend of agriculture award three times
8680295 luetkemeyer has a background in agriculture and business and understands the plight of farmers ranchers and rural communities
8680296 he is a proponent of protecting the farm safety net lessening governmental regulation and expanding foreign markets through trade agreements

8680300 in a choice between chris carney and a conservative republican i will always choose the conservative republican
8680301 i had a very pleasant lunch with dan but it was a private discussion that i plan on keeping private
8680302 i dont feel you need to be an elected official to do effective public service
8680303 hes voted against senior citizens farmers schools truckers you name it every single american needs relief from high gasoline prices and we cant get it by giving congress another vacation
8680304 congressman davis is a pro drilling democrat who has fought for common sense solutions to bring down the price of fuel he has consistently voted to increase domestic supplies including drilling in anwr and the outer continental shelf and supports a comprehensive roadmap to energy independence that includes nuclear wind solar biomass and other alternative energy supplies
8680305 sometimes people protect a tree and not the people i believe in envrionmentally safe drilling
8680306 the county has many drivers coming from rural areas and these issues are very important to them
8680307 every endorsement is important but this is one of the most important because the number one industry in the district is agriculture
8680308 they did what the farm bureau has always done they chose a party
8680309 i will put my confidence in agriculture all the way up and down the chain
8680310 your mainstream organizations tend to overlook the new political parties that are out there
8680311 smaller family local farms can actually be part of the solution to global warming
8680312 the committee thought that hed done a good job as a state legislator and was up on all the ag issues
8680313 we need to authorize offshore drilling for oil plus make better use of nuclear and coal technologies while developing solar wind and hydrogen for the future
8680314 you can say you support agriculture but how do you support big corn when you take money from big oil
8680315 farmers like most people are tired of paying 4 for a gallon of gas
8680316 we need to get our heads out of the sand
8680317 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8680318 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8680319 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8680320 for two years i kind of half assedly applied to go but didnt pursue it as strongly as i should have finally i got an email out of the blue telling me that oranim had a place available for me and i sort of decided to go i didnt pack until the day i was scheduled to leave i guess you can say i was ambivalent about the whole thing at best
8680321 life altering experience it changed my world i extended my trip by a month and i fell in love with the country in israel i finally felt completely comfortable with my own identity as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders i love that everything is jewish the land is beautiful the desert the ocean it really is the land of milk and honey the energy really rubs off on you and i am willing to sacrifice the material comfort of the us in exchange for the peace of mind i get here i dont care i really feel unburdened more creative and clear minded here
8680322 she described her local community as being wonderful but lacking a certain measure of diversity in college her jewish identity took a back seat to her african american heritage she immersed herself into that milieu and didnt tell anyone she was jewish unless they asked
8680323 in a desperate attempt to disguise britains decline as a sporting nation sports editors have recently given their reporters a new directive any contest in which a british competitor features with any degree of success should be referred to as a blue riband event hence for several days during the 1984 olympics an assistant bank manager from croydon was said to be the toast of los angeles after his triumph in the blue riband event for marksmen the small bore rifle shooting the british were narrowly edged out of the gold in the blue riband team show jumping event and broke the national record when finishing a creditable sixth in the blue event in the pool the womens 400 metre backstroke they compensated for a generally low score on the athletics track by managing to win golds in the three blue riband events there the decathlon the 1 500 metres and the womens javelin a feat that it was claimed made britain the envy of the athletics world after a disappointing show in the synchronized swimming it was decided that this was not a blue riband event after all but merely a tedious waste of time
8680324 samantha is certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book

8680326 and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8680327 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realises who the people using her are
8680328 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse

8680339 police refused those arrested access to attorneys police did not let detainees use phones unless they posted their own bonds and even failed to provide shoes in one case marching a protester into court in bare feet and leg shackles
8680340 tricked protesters into pleading guilty by giving them the impression they had to plead guilty in order to post bond this meant that no one was allowed to make a phone call unless they plead guilty thus making it impossible for arrestees to even call a lawyer until admitting guilt
8680341 that red phone boxes do not disappear into the great gray blur of the modern british streetscape

8680364 the bill is not about the so called political reform being mouthed by certain sections of the house leadership and malaca ang
8680365 this is not reforming the sad state of philippine politics it is adding another burden to ordinary taxpayers
8680366 if this bill is passed into law the operations development and other expenses of political parties like lakas and kampi will be funded by taxpayers money this will be another avenue into the national treasury that will be riddled by graft and corruption
8680367 ya pokoknya dia baik sangat solehah kalo untuk lebih detilnya saya saat ini tak bisa ngasih informasi
8680368 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
8680369 they will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with iraqs oil ministry
8680370 given traditional markets have been dominated by well established international oil companies new entrants such as cnpc have to focus on new markets
8680371 the majors are going to have to seriously rethink their returns criteria and resource ownership flexibility
8680372 looking forward to future bidding rounds iraq could cease to be that opportunity that people had hoped for and become a different play altogether
8680373 its difficult to see this having a wider implication for the majors and other contracts
8680374 this is a self contained project and is different in many ways to the large scale projects to boost oil capacity elsewhere in iraq
8680375 calls on the indian authorities and in particular security forces to respect the right to freedom of assembly and expression and comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8680376 the use of force should be proportionate to the threat posed and firearms must only be used in dispersing a violent assembly to protect individuals against an imminent threat of death or serious injury
8680377 the acting high commissioner calls for thorough and independent investigations into all killings that have occurred so far
8680378 leaders of the different protesting groups have a responsibility to ensure that demonstrations are peaceful and that the demonstrators are not carrying sticks guns or other weapons and refrain from intimidation

8680386 for now users can avoid the problem by changing their setting so that double clicking the home button goes to home or ipod
8680387 be sure to read and carefully follow all of the application instructions
8680388 sounds like a no brainer but an incomplete application starts things off on the wrong foot you dont want organizers having to chase you down for information when theyre already overloaded tracking down missing info for these folks takes precious time which we could be using to give all the applications the proper attention
8680389 its hard to see the craftsmanship and details in a blurry photo if your skills arent what youd like them to be ask a friend to help you the photos are often the only thing the event organizers have on which to base their decision so excellent photos could be your ticket to getting into the show
8680390 no one expects you to be the next ansel adams but these photos represent your work so its worth a bit of effort especially since these photos will probably end up being used in promotions for the show there are some great tips on building a diy lightbox at home including this one on the craftzine blog which can be especially helpful when taking shots of smaller items like jewelry and accessories the main thing to remember is to give your work the respect it deserves avoid using the flash and keep the backgrounds simple
8680391 i cant speak for every show out there but the felt club jury works very hard to present a well balanced and curated show but theres just no physical way we can fit everyone in it doesnt mean your stuff isnt good it just means it didnt fit into the show this time around be persistent and patient you could always get called in if a vendor needs to cancel its happened several times over the years with our show so hang in there

8680421 i was rather disconcerted to see that the arrangements put in place for ramadan which we support for muslim colleagues have been imposed upon all councillors
8680422 we object to the request that non muslim councillors observe the fasting rules for ramadan this sends out the wrong message to our community
8680423 our community consists of a huge number of different religions all of which should be valued and no one religion should be accorded more status or influence than others

8680440 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain candidate mccain now supports the very wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once called irresponsible candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding me folks talk about being for it before youre against it let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself

8680447 which makes it a very important piece of british motoring heritage
8680448 its had a little bit of modernisation over the years such as new wheels and axle from a 1930s austin and a more modern hitch but everything else is basically the same as it was when constructed
8680449 its very much like a garden shed on wheels and i can imagine it was very cosy in its day especially if you tried to fit more than one person inside it

8680451 our security measures at the border are rooted in this fundamental fact and our ability to achieve our border mission would be hampered if we did not apply the same search authorities to electronic media that we have long applied to physical objects including documents photographs film and other graphic material indeed there are numerous laws that apply to such material at the border including laws regarding intellectual property rights technical data that can be imported or exported only under state department license and child pornography

8680456 the problem facing many homebuyers is that they do not have enough detailed familiarity with neighborhoods of the cities they are considering homebuyers become frustrated after wasting time and effort viewing a house that looked perfect online only to later find that the neighborhood is not acceptable this is usually the point that they begin to enlist the help of an agent with local familiarity

8680517 it is part of our heritage but because pubs are disappearing so are the signs
8680518 but it is not just the fact that pubs are closing we are also losing some of the traditions if we keep going the way we are they will all be corporate signs and we will only have pubs called the rat amp parrot
8680519 the signs are a totally british institution all along our roads there are so many different types of sign but the ones for the pub are unique
8680520 i think it is a good advertisement for the industry and we advise people to try to save them where they can
8680521 we as a society feel that some form of planning permission should be required for any change of name or the removal of a pictorial sign
8680522 even if people don t come into the pub it might put a smile on their face when they go past
8680523 when i arrived victoria beckham was in pieces so i had to do something about it and decided vicky pollard had more of a local appeal a friend of mine is an artist so he agreed to do the job it doesnt really say much about what we are or what we do but people notice it and it is a talking point
8680524 for example jd wetherspoon has just redeveloped an old slug amp lettuce site in oxford and reopened it with the name the four candles
8680525 we always like to come up with different names and do some research in the area so we have about half a dozen to choose from
8680526 we feel that pubs are part of the community and so we chose a name to reflect that in this case it has also resulted in some press interest that was not the reason we did it but it certainly doesnt hurt
8680527 rather than it just being another pub opening if there is a name that might feature in the press it is not a bad thing
8680528 i am not a huge pub goer but i think the signs are such a part of our heritage they have got to be worth fighting for
8680529 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational

8680545 reaction from winston peters political opponents to the serious fraud office investigation has been swift and merciless
8680546 she should stop prevaricating hes the foreign minister of new zealand hes under investigation on numerous fronts it is a highly unusual action for the serious fraud office and if shes going to maintain what is left of the integrity of her government she has to stand him down now
8680547 if having a minister mislead her and mislead parliament isnt enough having a minister of foreign affairs under investigation by the serious fraud office well what sort of look does that give new zealand imagine the briefing notes other countries are getting on the minister of foreign affairs as they come to our country
8680548 winstons bluff and bluster wont work on the serious fraud office he wont be able to decide when he answers the questions or how he answers them

8680561 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8680562 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified
8680563 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8680564 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try to help people who are hurt through this
8680565 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme

8680571 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8680572 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8680573 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8680574 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8680575 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights

8680676 the plaintiffs in the veoh case never bothered to send a notice of infringing activity to veoh before they filed suit of course once veoh was sued and realized what it was getting in trouble for it took down all the infringing videos so the court was sympathetic that veoh had been taken by surprise

8680788 there are maybe two or three countries who are strong opposers strong sceptics

8680790 some other countries like belgium are also opposed but berlin is the key
8680791 they are telling us the chancellory is talking to the foreign ministry and so forth but no matter what they say the real problem is russia
8680792 if the eu ukraine summit is not successful it will send encouragement to russia that it can influence eu policy and eu strategy

8680799 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes
8680800 this is a result of not charging by the second
8680801 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences
8680802 for example operators may want to offer some tariffs with lower per minute charges that are billed in 30 or 60 second increments and other tariffs with higher per minute charges but smaller incremental billing units
8680803 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8680813 preliminary epidemiologic and microbiologic results to date support the conclusion that jalapeno peppers were a major vehicle by which the pathogen was transmitted and serrano peppers also were a vehicle tomatoes possibly were a vehicle particularly early in the outbreak
8680814 first neither raw jalapeno nor raw serrano peppers had previously been identified as a vehicle for a salmonella outbreak in the united states

8681052 im her parent i deserve the right to know what my child is taking and any parent should know if their child is on any medication
8681053 you send your daughter to school for an education for the day to learn you dont expect them to be taken to the doctor and put on the pill
8681054 for a child to take panadol at the school they need the parents permission so i cant understand why the school nurse can take your child to the doctor to get her put on the pill
8681055 i feel its broken down the relationships between the parents and their children
8681056 having said that i was surprised at the case and it would be incumbent on the school to advise the parents that course of action had been taken
8681057 i dont know all of the circumstances of the case every case is different im sure the school and the school nurse has acted with the best interest of the child at heart
8681058 but the child is only 14 there should have been consultation with the family
8681059 where this is not possible or the student refuses to do so and the student is deemed at serious risk the wellbeing co ordinators are obliged to assist the student in seeking medical advice
8681060 she said she is in the apartment she cant leave and theres a man there with a gun
8681061 from my point of view the conclusive reaction of the summit was muted because the present situation is quite severe and member countries of sco are not ready to go fighting the americans and nato
8681062 it was obvious that the reaction of the east would be different from the position of the west we have not received direct support in terms of the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia this is because china is very sensitive to the problems of separatism and we have not done enough to convince china that this is not about separatism but quite another process of dissolution of the state sco will support our peace efforts our actions to restore peace and thats something different
8681063 as a result of this attack israel with support of the us will completely destroy irans military power the war will be followed by a strong flow of refugees from iran to the north we can prevent flow of iranian refugees to our country owing to the new security region we established in the south caucasus
8681064 russia is the guarantor of peace and stability in the caucasus 20 more states will recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia in 5 7 years two more independent states have been included into the world map and this is a reality
8681065 aimed at preserving the unity of georgia and its territorial integrity
8681066 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8681067 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8681068 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8681069 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8681096 other systems use chilled water coils embedded in each computer cabinet and sometimes even embedded invasively into the compute blades with ecophlex technology you still use chilled water but much less of it and because of our unique engineering you dont need to worry about water condensation or leakage that could harm electronic components

8681159 che ha il compito di trasportare lascoltatore in una dimensione onirica e riflessiva unica e lo fa dapprima grazie alle splendide partiture di chitarra e alla desolante tristezza che il cantante riesce a far trasparire e poi nella seconda parte della canzone con uno stacco ai limiti dellambient dove non si odono pi chitarra e batteria ma solo eteree voci femminili che giocano a rincorrersi e a sovrapporsi nellincessante soffiare di un vento freddo e avvolgente

8681163 contrappone parti lente a parti pi tirate e veloci facendo sentire il viaggiatore come se si trovasse su una nave che solca un mare in tempesta la sua vita in mano alla natura che muove a suo piacimento le onde del mare le quali potrebbero inghiottire lo sventurato ascoltatore da un momento allaltro portandolo nelle pi lontane profondit delloceano
8681164 in my view hes not fit to be our foreign minister
8681165 serious questions about political funding which go to the heart of the democratic process and government
8681166 contactpoint will improve services to young people including safeguarding vulnerable children it will not exist to detect crimes nor be open for users to trawl for prosecution evidence
8681167 to access contactpoint to prevent or detect crime or for the prosecution of offenders police would have to make a special request directly to the secretary of state or local authority and make a clear exceptional case for disclosure this will be decided on a case by case basis
8681168 it makes a mockery of any idea of parent child confidentiality its one thing to say police need access to fight crime its another to create a database for the protection of children and then use it across government this was never about the protection of children
8681169 whitehalls system infrastructure needs to undergo radical surgery before the government can be seen as a respectful user of both new technology and personal information this government has a legacy of using technology to acquire information without vision on what it is used for how it will be used who will use it how it will be stored and how it will be secured
8681170 liberty is concerned that putting every child on the database might make it more difficult to identify the truly vulnerable because of the vast amount of data which must be sifted through unfortunately it seems that increasingly the rationale behind contactpoint is not child protection but the creation of another mass surveillance database
8681171 contactpoint records will only ever hold very basic identifying information and will not contain case notes and young peoples details will only remain on the database after their 18th birthday with their informed explicit consent

8681260 sometimes when i watch the premier league i think its becoming what is it becoming
8681261 does it really mean as much to the people who are playing i think that todays players dont have that same level of emotional attachment to the clubs they represent
8681262 with so much money involved does it mean as much to the individuals in it
8681263 my worry long term is if the premier league becomes a league table of individual wealth for the 20 wealthiest individuals around the world what will that mean
8681264 it wont mean a great deal at all and that will mean we have lost something incredibly precious which is institutions like liverpool that inspire local pride
8681265 clubs have drifted too far from their supporter base in recent times and they need to come back to their roots
8681266 football finances are very fragile and we have seen examples in the past where clubs have overreached themselves and it has had devastating consequences for the supporters more than anybody
8681267 there has been concern in recent times about the way in which some clubs have been taken over the debts are just guaranteed and there isnt a great deal of new money coming into the clubs
8681268 clubs should never be in the hands of one person who can do different things at a whim

8681276 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8681277 if you did track and field you should know that i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8681278 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event

8681280 i was in seoul and flo jo was running the last 20 meters with her hand waving in front of the other competitors nobody said anything

8681333 john mccain will be surrounded next week in minneapolis with the lobbyists that run his campaign
8681334 weve got folks begging for disability payments even though theyve earned those disability payments weve got veterans who are having to drive for hours to access a va facility because we havent put up enough clinics and now weve got the problem of hundreds of thousands of returning veterans who have done everything for this country i had some strong disagreements with george bush and john mccain about the war in iraq i think its a war we should have never authorized and i think its a war we should have never waged but one thing i thought we would all agree to is that when our troops come home theyre going to be treated with the honor and the respect that they deserve
8681335 the fact is that those hundreds of thousands of troops that are coming home right now are not getting what they need and its heartbreaking
8681336 the simple fact is were not doing right by our veterans not here in montana and not anywhere in the united states and i want you to know that one of the reasons im running for president of the united states is because i want to make sure that todays veterans are treated like my grandfather when he came home and got the gi bill and was able to go to college and got fha loans to go to school and was treated with honor
8681337 its the vastness of the country but within that the contrast as well
8681338 theres so much that makes it a special place and a unique place
8681339 just the wildlife and you look at the difference but also the appeal of places like cape town with table mountain and durban with the ocean and the climate
8681340 and then youve got the intrigue of the highveld and the impact that that has on the game its unique to here within the game
8681341 it probably started as a kid to be honest just listening to the radio in the middle of the night listening to test series
8681342 so thats where the intrigue started in obviously the degree of difficulty that teams had playing over here and the folklore that came out of that
8681343 i hadnt had the opportunity and i didnt think i was going to get the opportunity then we were presented with an opportunity
8681344 even when we got halfway here i still didnt think it was going to happen
8681345 whether id do it again or not i dont know that i would with the benefit of hindsight and if the circumstance was similar
8681346 prior to the fourth test we were in the shed about to run out and i just caught a glimpse of myself in my kit in the mirror
8681347 i thought well its just not the same because it wasnt the nations strip
8681348 and by that point we were conscious of the fact we didnt have full support domestically to that end it was never going to be the same
8681349 from a rugby perspective it fulfilled the expectation that i had around the venues
8681350 all the stadiums that we currently play in were built in the 70s and theyre unbelievable state of the art stadiums when you think about it thats remarkable because their still some of the best stadiums in the world
8681351 and then you put in those stadiums a rugby population thats so passionate and proud of their past then youve got some of the best atmospheres youll ever get to play the game in
8681352 obviously the mix in the game has evolved which is good thats for the better and i think with exposure to the world some of the outlooks of the traditional rugby people have broadened as well
8681353 the wildlife is obvious because its the only place that ive known in the world that i can come and see the big five rhinos cape buffalos elephants leopards and lions and to see them in real life is something pretty special and you never get sick of that
8681354 robben island what an incredible experience that was you can only do that here
8681355 but its the history of the place from a rugby perspective and obviously theres a lot of interest as well in the nation in terms of how theyve dealt with some of the challenges and how theyre going
8681356 weve been lucky enough to have seen the evolution from 96 forward and theres been a massive transformation
8681357 theres been an obvious transformation in the game as there has been in the society and that was always going to be one of the intriguing things
8681358 youve got to be optimistic youve got to chase what you seek and what you hope for
8681359 its not going to be straightforward youve only got to look at the rest of africa to see that but where theres a will theres a way
8681360 mandelas obviously been a big part of it and you just hope that people will pick up and run with what he started

8681362 these announcements which may or may not be true are bargaining chips and means for intimidation
8681363 they are basically lying a common tactic i saw it on the part of the iranians sometimes you can believe them sometimes you cant but they are very convincing when they try to persuade you
8681364 this business about closing the strait of hormuz everyones always talking about the iranian threat to strait of hormuz and to our shipping passage its not going to happen
8681365 it would be beyond cutting off your nose to spite your face
8681366 iranians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait of hormuz for last 40 years
8681367 the time when they actually did block the strait the iranians had not made any threats there is of course the possibility that they might do something and the u s navy has certainly been busy trying to do something about that
8681368 iranian conventional military capability is not very good due to age lack of investment so theyve put their resources into asymmetrical capability
8681369 so when something blows up they can say hey it wasnt me but of course it was
8681370 ahmadinejad keeps on advertising look at what we have today na na na na but big deal
8681371 if iran would take on the u s it would lose automatically and thats understood by them
8681372 they are saying the same thing as the french about shifting their energy resources to nuclear power actually its also quite similar to mccains energy policy
8681373 space development is really supporting the strategic development of ballistic missiles
8681374 why does any country develop long range ballistic missiles except for weapons of mass destruction you dont thats the concern
8681375 you dont build missiles to launch firecrackers you build missiles to build nuclear warheads to wipe everybody out
8681376 theyre making progress in area that has very ominous meaning to it how long will it be before they unleash what they really have

8681393 standard leige were tough they were really fighting even in extra time
8681394 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8681395 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8681396 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat

8681402 as you raise the chair over your head you notice the fear in pirate petes eyes desperately he raises his arms to protect his head but too late you bring the surprisingly light chair down on his skull well you think you do when you look at your hands you notice you are holding two broken chair legs next time you should look more closely at the weapon you choose meanwhile pete growls and hefts his cutlass again this fight is far from over
8681403 you breathe a sigh of relief as you see the city watch burst into the tavern everyone pauses in their battle pirate pete lowers his cutlass
8681404 you the leader of the watch yells at pete drop your sword you smile pete is the only armed person in the bar surely the watch will haul him off
8681405 however as the leader approaches pete you see the pirate dig into his pocket and come out with a gem the size of your eye without hesitating he flips it to the watch commander now im sure you fine officers can tell who the real culprits are cant you both pirate pete and the watch captain turn to face you

8681410 as they were state schools simply were not working in ratanakiri
8681411 children and their families had lost faith in the system and people simply stopped sending their children to school
8681412 through the school garden we teach children about nutrition and agriculture
8681413 lessons that they can take back to their home villages and have a real impact on their own communities
8681414 we establish community based school boards which are responsible for the supervision and management of the schools
8681415 and we are working closely with state education officials to ensure adherence to the national curriculum and promote the community school model on a national level
8681416 the cambodian department of education has already replicated the hcep model in other communities in ratanakiri and is working closely with care to expand the program to other districts in cambodia as well
8681417 many of my friends have left my village to find work in the factories in phnom penh
8681418 they dont think they need an education because they earn good money and send some back home to their families but by going to school i know that i can have even better opportunities here i have a clean place to live and good food and i enjoy being with my friends in many ways it is better than home but i miss my family
8681419 we are very fortunate to be able to get an education not everyone can
8681420 with education comes respect for yourself and for others most of my friends from home arent as lucky as i am

8681518 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8681519 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8681534 its clear to everyone in the room that canada is driving the bus
8681535 i have talked to anyone who will listen that this project should be a public private partnership
8681536 if this is a bad project the private financial backers will let us know
8681537 the only people who continue to say canada will not let us land the bridge is mdot and federal highway
8681538 i would encourage him to talk with the canadian government and go through the process
8681539 if the canadian government say they can land it then that changes the dynamic
8681540 however senator i must remind you that this in an international crossing and canadian officials have made it clear they will not grant access unless the environmental statement is in place
8681541 im disappointed the debate remains between the department and the legislature when so many people have voiced support for the project
8681542 but then i weighed out the options if something wasnt wrong then no real harm was done if something was wrong i really had no option so obviously i had to tell her
8681543 id seen a news article here in the u k a few years ago something similar and it just sparked a memory of that also the word cancer sprang to mind with the same memory so obviously i was quite concerned and just decided to do more research
8681544 grateful cannot even begin to describe how we feel toward maddie

8681548 i suppose im a hero in a certain sense but in another sense i think im rather normal and i care about people
8681549 it usually happens in infancy or early childhood and doctors precisely look in a babys eye with that light looking for a certain kind of reflection when that reflection is abnormal it raises the risk of whether this type of tumor is there
8681550 that white reflection you see in the babys eye is sometimes picked up just on routine photography in this case a web picture but what you hope is that doctors will see it internally before it gets to this stage
8681551 sometimes its there but its so faint it really appears later its hard to put blame somehow it was missed with our increasing number of premature babies there are other problems that could also sort of look like it
8681552 so it is a reminder for parents to ask doctors when you go for the baby checkup is everything ok
8681553 if something looks like this in a picture or your babys eyes arent moving together or one eye is bigger than another just pick up the phone and say somethings not right

8681570 as a loan professional are you sick and tired of buying the next marketing widget or educational product
8681571 to still be left telling the client why you are different and why they need to trust you
8681572 sure there are plenty of great marketing programs out there

8681574 at lend ethics we are there to support our members by implementing the marketing and creating a unique selling proposition for them lend ethics markets to consumers as to why they need to work with only lend ethics approved loan professionals so you the loan professional do not have to
8681575 consumers just dont trust the mortgage industry anymore putting cursive initials after your name or having a cool marketing campaign is not enough to win over their trust in these trying times
8681576 there are lots of programs out there that give you education do background checks and have a code of ethics this is all great but lend ethics is here not to just make you a better loan professional we are here to explain to the consumer why they need to only work with a trusted lend ethics approved loan professional
8681577 we are only looking for the best loan professionals to join our network professionals who mission on honesty and integrity it is time to spend money on something that is going to put you in front of the consumer then all you have to do is just sit back and be a trusted mortgage professional not a marketing guru
8681578 can someone in recovery still enjoy their passion for cooking and entertaining without including alcohol
8681579 i had heard of the dangers of being around alcohol while cooking or socializing
8681580 i knew that cravings could be triggered under these circumstances and that recovery could be put at high risk
8681581 i began to experiment with different kinds of substitutes to find ways to create the same flavor by using various alcohol free ingredients says scott
8681582 by using substitutes like a special combination of orange juice orange oil and bitter orange marmalade in recipes like duck a lorange a french dish known for its use of grand marnier or curacao i was able to create a unique dish that tasted just as yummy as the original dish
8681583 i wanted to make this book as easy to read and utilize as possible while showing that like my own recovery great recipes and healthy choices are made one step at a time
8681584 the joy of cooking and entertaining shouldnt be limited because someone doesnt drink or like alcohol great food experiences should be for everyone

8681793 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings

8681853 even though our business works further into the life cycle management process than design and construction it is critically important that we endorse evolving sustainability standards like bim and leed
8681854 our bottom line is that its the right thing to do for our customers our profession and for our society we see bimstorm sponsorship as taking one more step towards greater social responsibility as a business
8681855 when onuma partnered with the buildingsmart alliance at the national institute of building sciences to create bimstorm the energy and visibility created across the facility professions was significant it supported the federal facilities community in taking a world leading role in sustainability
8681856 one of our greatest challenges in asset management lies in capturing and sustaining information about buildings that have existed for some time

8681858 but it gets tiring to be on the road all the time its either that or work a day job id rather sit in a van for now anyway
8681859 all the songs were written 25 years ago so it was like trying to recreate being a kid
8681860 when i came back to vancouver after the gig we had to start practising for a black mountain tour and the first time or two i felt like i was in rush i had all these guitar pedals and i was like ugh i hate this that stuff from when we were 12 13 and 14 was so pure

8681862 theres no reason for a major selloff because the global context remains fragile the market remains balanced between risk aversion and risk appetite
8681863 gt mccain says obama is just the latest britney spears or paris hilton be respectful of others and their opinions
8681864 we need to win this game for south africa the coaching staff and all those involved with the boks
8681865 we certainly dont want to get together at the end of the year before the boks go to europe still asking ourselves questions about our game
8681866 we need to build some confidence now and ensure we take the chances we create this weekend
8681867 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman
8681868 hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete like bolt
8681869 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen
8681870 ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength that symonds has
8681871 the guy paralyses you you cant teach guys that its natural
8681872 when i first got involved with the australian cricket team in 2003 we focused on our footwork throwing and quickness little strategies
8681873 we jumped the other countries they werent ready for it
8681874 but now theyve watched and everyones taken it on board and its great for cricket
8681875 were back to playing the footy that we like to play and that is intimidating teams putting the pressure on and making the most of the turnovers
8681876 were just playing as a team and not relying on too many individuals
8681877 we can finish top four but freo have got a lot of blokes that are retiring so theyre going to be out to beat us as well
8681878 ive been in that position before where collingwood was down the bottom of the ladder and youre playing just to knock a team off and wreck their finals chances so theyll be fired up so its a matter of us taking them on early
8681879 hes obviously just walking at this stage but hell have a long break
8681880 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8681881 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8681882 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8681883 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8681884 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8681885 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8681886 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8681887 hi jon that will be gbp 60 about payment i cant use my paypal or bank account because im in divorce and i dont want to split the money with my future ex wife with moneygram we can complete the transaction in a couple of days because i will ship the package through ups same day payment is confirmed it will take maximum three working days until you receive the package it will be shipped fully insured and youll receive it directly to your address so if you agree there will be no problems regards chris
8681888 if i was in drew mitchells position and id come in and replaced an injured fullback and performed the way he did id expect to retain that position
8681889 one is because you become a little bit rusty you lose all the skill aspects i wasnt allowed to catch a ball for two or three weeks i wanted to but the doc just wouldnt let me
8681890 also two you cant train with the guys you feel left out so youre running up and down the sideline doing fitness while theyre together playing competitive games and training games
8681891 and three obviously with them playing football and youre not youre sitting on the side feeling useless really and obviously with such a great win you couldnt feel part of it and it was upsetting
8681892 the all blacks applied a lot of pressure in my area at fullback so i basically couldnt do anything with that
8681893 i felt pretty much useless so ill be looking to go out there and definitely make the most of it i suppose come back from that new zealand test
8681894 i was out for 10 or 15 seconds i thought i got up straight away but the footage showed that i was having a breather
8681895 i remember getting up and the doctor saying are you all right and i said im all right and i remember him saying youve got to go push and he pushed me to the other side of the field and then i had sooialo to deal with
8681896 i suppose performing well at fullback in the last couple of games i suppose the sydney test was the highlight it changes that opinion
8681897 no child left behind or i was a pow for 5 years
8681898 climate change and its economic social and ecological consequences are a reality and demand a responsible and considered response
8681899 hypnosis is often misunderstood because of sensationalism and melodrama coming out of hollywood and especially nowadays on the internet the contributors to this book are working hypnotists with years of experience this book is an effort to give the public a better understanding of how hypnosis can help them

8681901 people dont realize how many types of algae there are from single cells to large kelp and each one develops differently
8681902 what were trying to do is choose the best of the best the ones that produce the right lipids for a particular type of fuel
8681903 the most optimistic assessment that ive heard is that it could be six to eight years before theres something thats useable but the tools and techniques to make it possible are being created right now
8681904 my team and i put together the idea of the mortgage adoption center as a service for our past clients
8681905 but as we started to put the program together we heard story after story from friends and family members of clients who hadnt heard from their mortgage broker in years or had been told about home mortgage loans or loan refinancing opportunities that actually hurt their long term financial goals these stories in addition to the current state of the loan industry compelled us to offer the service to all homeowners free of charge to help those homeowners whose loans have been abandoned by their loan professional
8681906 we are incredibly proud to offer the refinancing alert service at http mortgageadoptioncenter com and look forward to helping its users save money and time in refinancing their home mortgage loans
8681907 cfo magazine is performing very well in a difficult year for b2b media with display pages holding at previous year levels
8681908 this is in spite of the fact that we reduced the number of issues for cfo magazine to 11 in 2008
8681909 our web sales are gaining traction especially with webcasts and other sponsorships and our research business is on track for a record year as with other conference producers cfo is experiencing some negative impact due to the economy and increased fuel prices but overall our franchise is performing well in stormy seas
8681910 we are not immune to the pressures of downward economic cycles and do expect increased headwinds as the year advances yet we continue to uncover sales opportunities as advertisers and sponsors appreciate the value of our decision making audience
8681911 weve got some interesting programs in the pipeline and anticipate creating more client specific programs leveraging our content expertise in such critical topics as international financial reporting standards xbrl and fair value accounting in addition our technology advertisers are continuing to invest in the cfo brand
8681912 i hack for a living that is something that many cant say without a snicker in return but trust me those that do are extremely smart and very well paid chicagocon is meant to not only showcase their abilities and educate a new crop of security professionals but more importantly reclaim the word hacker from the grip of a negative press
8681913 theres this hazy line between government and the party the ruling party is basically doing its propaganda and its electoral campaign using government actions
8681914 the other thing is the party doing its campaign but of course they are mixing all of these and using public funds and public resources to conduct the campaign transportation all these resources
8681915 there is this unending saga with where the party ends and where the government begins
8681916 we are supposed to be selling ideas and programmes and then have people choose on that basis but if those in power are short on ideas but plenty on goods that has a potential to distort what we are trying to do here
8681917 clearly jornal de angola is working for mpla the state media is being overwhelmingly used to publicise mpla every time the television shows an event or rally by the opposition it will show the worst possible images while for the mpla its all very neat very composed very nice
8681918 its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
8681919 patterns of violence include sporadic assaults by local mpla supporters sometimes involving traditional authorities and local mpla leaders against local unita party members and their property and party symbols
8681920 obviously in the interior provinces there is still some fear out there
8681921 of course people interpret this in different ways will this be an earthquake in the country or within the mpla party
8681922 our message to people is people will vote on september 5 and life will continue the sun will rise just as it normally rises we will wait for the results to be announced and we will simply continue to live our lives waiting for the next election
8681923 a couple of years ago i was like you know

8681931 i am surprised but honored to be recognized by the cahcc
8681932 since founding my first company in 1982 ive learned the key is struggling to stay alive looking for every resource you can to meet the next milestone make the next sale especially in this tough economy and never throwing in the towel
8681933 while many will divert some incremental loan volume away from the larger more established competitors in the marketplace today many more will struggle to rise above the lowest volume thresholds
8681934 of the new competitors in jul dec 2007 22 6 did no business just six months later and trends suggest almost a 50 fallout rate as they approach 1 2 years seasoning

8681939 its not always wise to start someone in that situation when the games very intense
8681940 but to come off the bench hed be pretty good the two strikers were probably the two outstanding players last week
8681941 its important we find out exactly where were at at this stage of the season
8681942 theyve changed their formation virtually every game ive seen them play in the pre season and the first two rounds
8681943 i would say garys either trying to change a couple of things so all we can do is focus on what we do well
8681944 is a contest big enough to get a lot of people involved on the inside its a community of writers and readers dedicated to great storytelling and to breaking down walls of human isolation
8681945 we are now fully in the multi core many core era its widely assumed that these chips will be the dominant platforms for servers and client devices there are however many unknowns for the future its obvious that as the more processor cores are used it is more important to address hw sw system performance
8681946 at the early stage of system development performance and architecture simulation can be performed with using visualsim from mirabilis design inc which assist the multi core many core developer to address performance issues quickly with minimum effort we recognize the visualsim as one of the best tools for multi core and many core architecture
8681947 with the continuing broadband revolution mirabilis design is uniquely positioned to assist system architects and designers in the development of new applications products and protocols
8681948 currently there is a gap in front end design and visualsim helps engineers translate ideas into new products in todays competitive environment it is critical to design it right the first time
8681949 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8681950 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8681951 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8681952 the process of settlement is a civilization jihadist process with all the word means the ikhwan must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
8681953 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles
8681954 ibm is an ideal partner for hci and the talent management forum for government an opportunity for federal talent professionals to learn innovative human capital practices they can apply immediately at their organizations

8681961 2 day course cloud computing managing services that are in the cloud the itil service management way
8681962 there is a lot more to cloud computing than initial thoughts
8681963 i found this an extremely valuable experience to assist my understanding of cloud computing concepts issues and the processes needed to develop successful migration strategies or implement cloud computing solutions
8681964 the 3 most useful things i have learnt on this course were service level management positioning of cloud computing and seeing opportunities for use in our organsation
8681965 lately there is a lot of media exposure on cloud computing on demand computing and virtualization most of the presentations and articles focus on the technical side of it presenting the newest generation of vmware or the way virtualization of servers can be organised but what about the other side of the story how do you manage the continuity of the services that make use of could computing how do you ensure consistency in service levels how do you choose the best provider of your on demand computing services and that doesnt even touch on information security an important side of any it services especially when it uses the cloud for part of the delivery we felt it was an important step to enable us to become a more rounded organisation in terms of it service management solutions expectations on all of us are increasing and this course gives our clients that additional knowledge to show we are a progressive organisation
8681966 with the right training staff will feel more confident satisfied self reliant and actively communicate more effectively introducing and implementing virtualization and cloud computing training programmes will have a ripple effect throughout a company thus improving morale retention efficiency and productivity
8681967 practical education is at the heart of the art of service
8681968 the more you eat the less flavor the less you eat the more flavor
8681969 a man may be a pessimistic determinist before lunch and an optimistic believer in the wills freedom after it
8681970 for us the term enjoy the ride is more than just a slogan we truly try to make the experience as enjoyable and as possible
8681971 this is one of the reasons we decided to give new member a free 25 bonus
8681972 the summer internship program my law firm offers is the perfect way for students hoping to attend law school to get real life experience with tax law
8681973 by coming to work at my firm the interns are able to gain prospective on tax law as well as an opportunity to rub shoulders with and ask questions of attorneys who work in tax law
8681974 the interns learned how to perform all the same duties as the full time assistants
8681975 they process incoming documentation sent to us by our clients and help to prepare the clients files for negotiations with the irs they also review and process irs mail as needed the interns have also been instrumental in helping the law firm keep pace on work relating to creating the electronic client files
8681976 in school youre always so focused on how a teacher or a judge sees things that it is easy to disregard the perspective of the client and other third parties
8681977 working at this firm gives the interns the unique opportunity to see hear and experience how the legal process unfolds from the client representatives perspective as well as the clients perspective it is important to be able to understand or at least empathize with all sides of the issue both in law school and as an attorney
8681978 i learned a lot about the field of tax law and gained hands on experience with real life tax law
8681979 it has been rewarding to play a part in helping people resolve their tax liabilities plus i really enjoyed working in the law firms laid back yet productive environment
8681980 our practice is very deadline driven and the interns have worked hard this summer
8681981 they have taken some of the pressure off the law firms full time employees i believe this has allowed us to focus a little more time on providing our clients with the outstanding service they deserve
8681982 i am looking forward to offering this program in the summers to follow it gives prospective attorneys a worthwhile experience and guidance while giving my law firm and our clients dedicated and interested workers i cannot think of a better trade off
8681983 working at a private law firm before law school makes sense
8681984 it gives interns a chance to get their feet wet experiencing the work environment first hand it also provides them some perspective of what it is like in the real world before taking the law school plunge

8682031 north queensland has met all the commercial criteria we set for them last month including local community and business support which has been terrific

8682039 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8682040 we should be so lucky if we were important enough for google to actually respond to something were doing
8682041 much of our work in creating our assessment for use in corporate wellness programs is in debt to dr mcewens research
8682042 we rely on his expertise in leading our board as we pursue visibility in the corporate sector as well as among the many research associations on diseases with clear ties to accumulated stress
8682043 you can find all the details you need an plenty of pics to guide you
8682044 our goal is to have hospitals fix these events and change their systems so they dont reoccur

8682060 napster existed solely to provide the site and facilities for copyright infringement and its control over its system was directly intertwined with its ability to control infringing activity by contrast veohs right and ability to control its system does not equate to the right and ability to control infringing activity unlike napster there is no suggestion that veoh aims to encourage copyright infringement on its system and there is no evidence that veoh can control what content users choose to upload before it is uploaded
8682061 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8682062 the result was driven by some unique facts in the case first and foremost that io is seeking to protect copyright in adult material and for whatever reason did not give notice to veoh that they were hosting infringing material

8682084 the suspension of the mehdi army is considered valid for an indefinite period and whoever disobeys this should not count themselves a member of this religious sect
8682085 the first section is the armed one for resisting only the occupiers and to not carry weapons against any other side the second part will undertake ethical and cultural issues to change the society from its tendencies toward a secular and western orientation to a society based on islamic and religious culture
8682086 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8682087 nothing comes in frozen except for chips and onion rings
8682088 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8682089 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8682090 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8682091 if people start canceling their vacations to the gulf because of the storm were probably going to have less demand for fuel than anticipated
8682092 weve tried to make presentations with a variety of offers and terms but theyve been rejected at this point and time
8682093 i think mez is a potentially good young defenceman who had a bit of an off year this past year and weve asked their camp to entertain that in what were trying to do with him
8682094 i think weve made more than a fair offer and put ourselves in a position where he could come here and with some help we think he can be a top player
8682095 we need their camp to help us in that area as well ive tried to get that message across but to this point we havent gotten there
8682096 his agent has brought that up there have been a variety of scenarios that theyve passed back to us
8682097 if my guesses are confirmed i could suspect that someone in the u s triggered this conflict on purpose in order to escalate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the u s presidential candidates
8682098 russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8682099 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8682100 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8682101 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase
8682102 maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear program
8682103 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control

8682113 there are two dates that have changed the world in recent years sept 11 2001 and aug 8 2008
8682114 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world
8682115 that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing we were sitting in our homes the national discussion was internal now this georgian attack is perceived as aggression and made us realize that we cannot stay home we have to go outside our homes to protect ourselves on new frontiers
8682116 there are two dates that have changed the world in recent years sept 11 2001 and aug 8 2008

8682119 i do worry about children being abducted because it happens
8682120 i think the best choice is to protect them as long as you can
8682121 she and i do not see eye to eye on this
8682122 im pretty certain ive been called a hypocrite because of the way i was raised
8682123 it depends upon the child and it depends upon the neighbourhood
8682124 one of the fears that parents expressed was that their children could be harmed or kidnapped
8682125 in fact more kids are hurt by the cars of parents driving other kids to school considerably more the percentage of kids who are nabbed on their way to school is minuscule
8682126 we havent encouraged them to walk alone at any specific age
8682127 some of the neighbourhoods are not such that we recommend it
8682128 we never expect or encourage even 10 year olds to be riding their bikes alone
8682129 we have a number of parents who are also walking with our middle school students
8682130 long story short my son got home ecstatic with independence
8682131 long story longer and analyzed to boot half the people ive told this episode to now want to turn me in for child abuse as if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cellphone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids its not its debilitating for us and for them
8682132 its very very annoying the squirrels cant get past that they decide its a bad place to raise their young

8682166 and our findings clearly showed there to be a pattern of terminal decline even among relatively healthy individuals that the brain changes that influence our cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time even among individuals who remain non demented until they die
8682167 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8682168 weve found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8682169 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes
8682170 this means the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechano sensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre flight pose

8682173 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8682174 these would be to the detriment of the eu as much if not more than russia
8682175 we need the new agreement as much as the eu does not less not more should such a grave mistake be made by the eu leaders which i hope they will avoid we will have to live with existing arrangements
8682176 most of the steps i have heard mentioned meant to punish russia would not work
8682177 they wont change russias behavior and moscow will turn around and respond
8682178 up until now tadawul has been the least open to foreign investment among the gcc bourses
8682179 this step is considered a leap in the regulators efforts to diversify the markets investor base and develop the kingdoms financial market
8682180 it is a step towards further liberalization of the market but more importantly it shows that the saudis want to do this very gradually and very slowly for two reasons one is that opening up the market to foreign investors brings up more liquidity and thats the last thing they need right now
8682181 but what theyre the saudis interested in is bringing in expertise hoping that the presence of foreign investors will slowly force local investors to adopt much more transparent rules of doing business
8682182 it is a step towards further liberalization of the market but more importantly it shows that the saudis want to do this very gradually
8682183 will greatly enhance the depth and breadth to of the saudi capital market
8682184 this development will undoubtedly increase foreign capital inflows to the kingdoms stock market promote greater transparency reduce volatility associated with dominance of the retail investors in the saudi market and encourage more comprehensive equity research on listed companies
8682185 buy out firms are unlikely saviours but private equitys 450 billion war chest is big enough to fill western banks capital shortfall
8682186 there are few other sources of ready capital sovereign wealth funds have been badly burnt banks cannot easily raise equity in public markets and the atrophy in many of the biggest lenders leaves them in a poor state to buy the weakest
8682187 before private equity takes the plunge the rules may need to be tweaked as early as next month the fed is expected to offer more guidance on the grey area of the ownership thresholds probably relaxing its stance
8682188 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8682189 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8682190 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8682191 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8682192 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8682193 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency
8682194 weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand

8682237 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8682238 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8682239 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8682240 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8682241 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8682242 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8682243 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8682244 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8682245 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8682246 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8682247 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8682248 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8682249 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
8682250 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8682251 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8682252 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8682253 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8682254 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8682255 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8682256 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8682257 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8682258 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8682259 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8682260 we used to carry both the flotation device which is the seat cushion as well as lifevests
8682261 the nature of our operations doesnt require that we carry both
8682262 transport canada was satisfied that we met the regulation and they approved the change
8682263 they are going to save about 50 pounds 23kg taking off 50 pounds is not going to make a hell of a lot of difference to the fuel consumption

8682362 this is a case that is extreme the defendant in this case plotted with a co defendant to partake in an aggravated robbery an aggravated robbery in which they were armed with a rifle and an air pistol where they intended to go to the residence of the deceased and confront the resident

8682432 racism is so strong and ingrained in western pennsylvania that he will need to convince voters that as much as they dont want to vote for him they cannot afford to have another republican administration
8682433 a lot of people are going to make excuses because he is black and that would make it harder to get him elected
8682434 im telling people to support obama because he has a real progressive message for change
8682435 the average worker needs to know that they need to support obama because we would not get anything from john mccain except hardship for most of us
8682436 i hope our country is better than that but i dont trust the republicans they would do anything to inject fear in people to not vote for obama
8682437 what we need to focus on as a country is on the issues and not race all people are created equal
8682438 im upset that in this country we dont have healthcare for all we have senior citizens who dont have health insurance and thats a shame
8682439 im a strong supporter of obama and a member of his national steering committee for hispanics
8682440 we are very energised and excited and were going to come out of denver united
8682441 i know for a fact that there is no such thing as an easy election
8682442 the gop republican party are geniuses in negative campaigning but well do everything we can to get obama elected
8682443 race will always play a role in politics but obama as a nominee is a very good thing for america
8682444 im a conservative democrat i dont care what the colour of his skin is
8682445 this is about green money and the economy more than anything else we cant be scared about voting for him ive seen him fight for people he didnt just start here

8682450 weve created a website for mobile phones that display the most popular news headlines as determined by fellow readers headlines come from the mobile versions of reuters cnn new york times etc
8682451 users vote for the news articles they find interesting once a headline gets a certain amount of votes its displayed on the front page so when you visit newsnomad youll see the most popular and interesting stories of the day
8682452 we include a few advertisements on newsnomad which allows us to provide this service free of charge while continually improving the user experience
8682453 alex has phd in mathematics and has worked as a principle engineer and architect in various companies including polycom lucent and motorola im a full time uc berkeley student pursuing a degree in computer science
8682454 since our beta launch a few days ago weve had over 7 000 people visit our website and cast a total of 500 votes as with any internet service we hope to exponentially increase this number in the coming months one of the advantages of catering to a mobile audience is the fact that our advertising medium isnt limited to the web because people carry their phones with them everywhere they go advertising in the real world on trains billboards etc becomes a viable option
8682455 recommendation is a core part of our service users recommend stories to one another by voting on them future plans for newsnomad include a recommendation engine as well
8682456 as of now newsnomad is the first and only social news service geared entirely toward mobile devices our closest competitors are the huge socials news sites of the internet reddit etc however despite the fact that these giants have created mobile versions of their sites almost all of their headlines come from websites that mobile browsers cant view so you can visit digg from your mobile phone but you cant read the majority of the stories
8682457 i think were at the start of a new mobile dot com bubble as data plans become cheaper and networks become faster more and more people are taking advantage of the mobile web and 405 million used it in 2007

8682483 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8682484 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8682485 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8682486 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8682487 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8682493 pretenderemos que cencosud financie 18 9 millones de d lares de los 19 millones de d lares que cuestan las obras seguramente ellos querr n no s poner 12 millones de d lares eso es fruto de la negociaci n
8682494 el estudio podr a ser rechazado si las mitigaciones viales son insuficientes en general las obras deben ser financiadas por el titular del proyecto

8682499 mccain at first seemed happy enough to do the interview but his mood quickly soured the mccain on display in the 24 minute interview was prickly at times abrasive and determined not to stray off message an excerpt
8682500 well my record is clear i believe that the world is better off without saddam hussein i believe its clear that he had every intention to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction i can only imagine what saddam hussein would be doing with the wealth he would acquire with oil at 110 and 120 a barrel
8682501 think of how destabilized iraq would have been when saddam hussein died in 2003 without our intervention
8682502 my record shows that i have put my country first and i follow the philosophy and traditions of abraham lincoln and theodore roosevelt and ronald reagan
8682503 it was abraham lincolns declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the confederacy that had not already returned to federal control by january 1863 the ten affected states were individually named in the second part not included were the union slave states of maryland delaware missouri and kentucky
8682504 anything so far about this campaign that you wish you could take back
8682505 pro big government welfare warfare statist that in the end will destroy your liberties
8682506 a lot of people know about your service from your books but most people dont know that you have two sons currently in the military can you describe what it means to have jack and jimmy in uniform
8682507 i suppose on one level you have to feel just a little sorry for mccain after all he was plowed under in 2000 by the rove machine
8682508 here is an example of honor that i wrote about in one of my books
8682509 in 2000 after the primaries you went back to south carolina to talk about what you felt was a mistake you had made on the confederate flag is there anything so far about this campaign that you wish you could take back or you might revisit when its over
8682510 do i know you says with a laugh long pause im very happy with the way our campaign has been conducted and i am very pleased and humbled to have the nomination of the republican party
8682511 time i wonder if you could define honor for us
8682512 youre all wrong but im not willing to explain debate why

8682520 it could also help businesses that produce virtually no greenhouse emissions such as wind farms know where to best locate their operations he said
8682521 obama and mccain who face off in a november election both support regulation of greenhouse gases through market mechanisms such as cap and trade programs on emissions
8682522 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
8682523 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
8682524 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself

8682528 we are surprised by overwhelming buzz for twilight as the film to beat for the fall
8682529 among all upcoming movies twilight has consistently ranked among our top 3 most requested titles the other two are harry potter and watchmen much of the anticipation has to do with the blockbuster novel and moviegoers looking for a great fantasy in the fall it appears to have a wide appeal as parents are also looking for a film they can enjoy along with their teenagers
8682530 sen barack obama of illinois completed an improbable and historic journey here wednesday when he was nominated by acclamation as the democratic candidate for president becoming the first african american to lead a major political party into a general election campaign obama who just eight years ago attended his first democratic national convention and who four years later shot to national prominence with an electrifying keynote address at the gathering in boston was given a final symbolic boost wednesday by sen hillary rodham clinton who moved from the convention floor to suspend the roll call of the states and formalize her former rivals nomination by acclamation
8682531 brought to an end an often bitter two year political struggle for the nomination with senator hillary rodham clinton of new york who standing on a packed convention floor electric with anticipation moved to halt the roll call in progress so that the convention could nominate mr
8682532 framed the case for sen barack obama and against the republicans in a way that no one at this convention had done before only a day earlier when there was some unease among clintons associates about whether he was being straitjacketed in what he could say in his speech obama tried to defuse the situation by saying clinton could say whatever he wanted good call as it turned out
8682533 perhaps not even obama himself could have conjured up an oration so powerful on his behalf not only did clinton utter the words barack obama 15 times they came in his first sentence and his last and there were long riffs about the candidate in between
8682534 with an ode to his middle class upbringing and a blistering attack on senator john mccain on tax policy and the war in iraq on health care and terrorism on the minimum wage and on russia mr biden said the contrast was clear between mr mccain and the democratic presidential nominee senator barack obama
8682535 it was red meat stuff for the 4 233 democratic delegates packed into the pepsi center for the partys national convention many of whom were looking to biden to fill a role they say presidential nominee barack obama badly needs that of an aggressive and experienced attacker
8682536 they misread the threat and misled the country instead of freedom its hamas hezbollah the taliban and dictators everywhere that are on the march north korea can build more bombs and iran is defiantly chasing one
8682537 the world has always been more impressed with the power of our example than in the example of our power
8682538 talk about being for it before your were against it
8682539 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8682540 perhaps not even obama himself could have conjured up an oration so powerful on his behalf not only did clinton utter the words barack obama 15 times
8682541 however its worth pointing out that obama will officially be the

8682547 they are the people i feel really sorry for there is a lot riding on that they are going to be feeling pressure as it is and you dont want to be standing over a three footer with so much doubt in your mind not knowing if the ball is going to run straight
8682548 has decided on his running mate two republican strategists in contact with mr mccains campaign said wednesday he is expected to reveal his choice at 11 a m friday at a rally at a basketball arena in dayton ohio republicans close to the campaign said that the top contenders remained the same three men who have been the source of speculation for weeks former gov mitt romney of massachusetts gov tim pawlenty of minnesota and possibly senator joseph i lieberman independent of connecticut
8682549 lieberman dismissed the request lieberman laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8682550 speaking of lieberman politicos martin writes that karl rove called the connecticut senator to urge him to withdraw his name from vp consideration
8682551 are you nuts this is a chance to play with the big boys
8682552 only an a hole would put together a budget like this

8682560 what can i say the fans have spoken sara returns
8682561 i think it was at some point during the writers strike that i started hearing rumors that sara was returning that the fans were organising write ins and petitions and i think thats emblematic of where we are in terms of television and the media
8682562 its very much a back and forth conversation between the fans and the writers between the writers and the powers that be their opinions especially when expressed online or via correspondence are important and are taken into consideration
8682563 own a piece of history only buying the dvd will get you the full complete outrageous movie and game sadly the rental version is edited down and doesnt include the infamous postal games so dont get beat renting it

8682565 i dont know how anyone could do it in those stinky little toilets there is no room in there whatsoever

8682571 i like to think that im nowhere near guy ritchie as i said before guy ritchie makes plastic gangster films he writes about characters that are caricatures whereas mine are real characters they are actually london boys theyre robbing a bank
8682572 its the real thing and hopefully when people watch it they will appreciate what im trying to do i am trying to change peoples minds on all these over played exaggerated gangster movies
8682573 one senior republican who has talked personally with romney ridge and pawlenty during the past two days said none of them had been told yet by mccain all of them believe that its not them the gop source said
8682574 if security sweeps are the giveaway former massachusetts gov mitt romney may be on the brink of being selected as sen john mccains r ariz vice presidential running mate according to sources with strong michigan ties the secret service has conducted a security sweep of the home of romneys sister romney was raised in michigan where his father served as governor
8682575 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8682576 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8682577 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8682578 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8682579 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

8682600 carrying capacity today given current technologies levels of consumption and socioeconomic organization has ingenuity made todays population sustainable the answer to this question is clearly no by a simple standard the current population of 5 5 billion is being maintained only through the exhaustion and dispersion of a one time inheritance of natural capital ehrlich and ehrlich 1990 including topsoil groundwater and biodiversity the rapid depletion of these essential resources coupled with a worldwide degradation of land jacobs 1991 myers 1984 postel 1989 and atmospheric quality jones and wigley 1989 schneider 1990 indicate that the human enterprise has not only exceeded its current social carrying capacity but it is actually reducing future potential biophysical carrying capacities by depleting essential natural capital stocks
8682601 because most of those people should have went for smaller houses with lower utility bills and lower monthly payments
8682602 actually many of the people could afford their loan at first but the interest rate went up because it was not fixed also the bank did not help the situation they gave loans out like they were candy
8682603 more kids more mouths to feed more pressure on the planet less of the problems we have today
8682604 are proof of government inaction in the area of reduction despite the green rhetoric
8682605 this is an extremely worrying development for many reasons not least the prospect of having to purchase carbon allowances on the open market in order to compensate for increasing emissions at a time when taxpayers money is scarce
8682606 instead of a specific government response which is what we need we get the usual lecture on the need to reduce emissions and the need to create green collar jobs
8682607 the greens have placed too much emphasis on merely highlighting the issue of climate change when what was needed were measures that would actually improve our environment and so improve our quality of life
8682608 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
8682609 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional to have done such a thing a week before a number of different scenarios could unfold
8682610 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case hes a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
8682611 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you
8682612 thats the most respectful thing i could have possibly wanted to hear from a captain
8682613 i really dont need to get into the monty discussion of he seems to think ive got a hotline the fact is i know nick and ive been fairly friendly with nick since ive come on tour
8682614 i shouldnt stop that fact just because hes ryder cup captain i dont need to get in the discussion of montys discussions hes got enough work to do this week to try to make the side himself he should just be getting his head down and trying to play good golf
8682615 there are a lot of emotions going about comments from players that i dont think should have been said to be honest
8682616 i think were all professional enough to understand everybodys situation and professional enough to understand everybodys schedules and we should be professional enough to understand peoples decisions
8682617 if you look at my statistics over the last 12 months in relation to the other names that have been put in the potential wild card pick choice im 70 points in the world rankings ahead of paul casey and darren clarke
8682618 ive played well this year and thats all i could have done i dont feel that i just have to go back for that one golf tournament to prove my point
8682619 this is a first step in what we hope will be the deployment of more than 2 million meters in our service territory said tom standish group president of regulated operations for centerpoint energy
8682620 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8682621 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8682622 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8682623 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8682624 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor

8682632 i think pres bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8682633 make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back

8682674 a partir de ah el resto de rivales nos van a pelear por entrar como segundos
8682675 es muy peligroso pensar que somos favoritos para ser segundos si pensamos as quedaremos eliminados tenemos que respetar a todos los rivales s lo as tendremos opciones de pasar
8682676 ya tiene due o y habr que pelear por la que queda
8682677 a lo mejor la gente piensa que el villarreal es favorito pero nosotros no podemos pensar as

8682681 satisfecho porque volvemos a jugar el primer y ltimo partido en casa que son cosas favorables en cualquier sorteo estamos contentos ya no por los equipos sino por el calendario siempre le doy importancia al hecho de jugar el primer ltimo partido en casa porque en europa son factores decisivos
8682682 hasta que no te encuentras con los equipos delante no se puede decir nada
8682683 en la champions est el prestigio y la gloria poder ser de nuevo campe n es uno de los objetivos pero reconociendo la dificultad existente
8682684 para ganar la liga de campeones hay que ganar a los mejores tener un grupo complicado es mejor para empezar fuerte y arrancar mejor la competici n
8682685 sobre el papel otros equipos espa oles lo tienen m s f cil
8682686 no hay que asustarse sino competir porque somos el equipo que m s veces ha ganado esta competici n tenemos mucha ilusi n por volver a ganarla pero con tranquilidad paso a paso

8682831 with daunting challenges of logistics style and substance the plan was hatched before the republicans began a concerted drive to paint mr obama as a media sensation lacking the r sum to be president now obama aides are feeling all the more pressure to bring a lofty candidacy to ground level showing that mr obama grasps the concerns of everyday americans

8682833 republicans who are mocking obamas appearance havent mentioned it but george w bush accepted his own nomination in 2004 on a set with a similar neoclassical theme with columns rising on either side of him indeed the bush set and the obama sets currently look strikingly similar with the podium set well in front of the columns and connected by a path
8682834 even before he entered public life he began honing not only his political skills but also his mental and emotional ones he developed a self discipline so complete friends and aides say that he has established dominion over not only what he does but also how he feels he does not easily exult despair or anger to do so would be an indulgence a distraction from his goals instead they say he separates himself from the moment and assesses
8682835 but with obama officially becoming the democratic presidential nominee on wednesday night some of the same qualities that have brought him just one election away from the white house his virtuosity his seriousness his ability to inspire his seeming immunity from the strains that afflict others may be among his biggest obstacles to getting there

8682846 an innovative program to prevent and treat child abuse which is the mission of family resources
8682847 when we see a child having a meltdown or a child standing dangerously in a shopping cart we dont know what to do
8682848 we are all kind of helpless and freeze when we see others in this situation what we want to do is enable people to assist these parents
8682849 the video showed how people could assist parents with their children through gentle intervention
8682850 i came aboard the project in the fall of 2002 when my boys were almost 3 and 5
8682851 we knew it was a great concept but we asked ourselves how can we get everyday people to understand and use this concept
8682852 lets just say that my younger son has always been an intense and loud child i was living it
8682853 i never got to meet him and i wanted to know his thoughts and plans for the program
8682854 what is the first thing you see on the show
8682855 we want people to stop and recognize when they may be able to help a parent or child take a moment to pause think and get ready to assist and three try one kind word to assist
8682856 getting involved may be as simple as standing closer to a shopping cart where a child is standing and in a dangerous situation while the parent is busy with another child
8682857 that was a lot of fun we filmed the video at the giant eagle in the waterworks from midnight to 6 a m here we are filming a video about child abuse and we had children there in the middle of the night
8682858 we had to get all sorts of waivers and special permission to make it
8682859 based on our feedback we can say that we can really impact how people can help parents in difficult situations
8682860 we want it to be a regional showpiece we want to put the message out in our region that one kind word can make a difference to someone
8682861 we have been talking with a major grocery store chain and other places such as museums and amusement parks we feel that anywhere large groups of families with children gather will be the ideal sites for the program
8682862 attention customers an inbound train toward the loop will be arriving shortly

8683024 people of good will who have studied the present day catholic teaching as given in the catechism of the catholic church john paul iis encyclical the gospel of life and have read the fathers of the church can easily recognize the flaws in her remarks on the teaching of the church concerning when human life begins

8683162 i am so sad to say it but i think that mccain would be better for the future of iraq especially since my family and friends are still living there
8683163 im a taxpayer now obama is better for the u s but not for iraq
8683164 iraqis back home prefer mccain they do not want an early withdrawal which will only leave the country in the hands of militias and political parties that will fight with each other
8683165 we do not have a strong military to stop that
8683166 a milkmaid will never tell you that her yogurt is sour
8683167 people back home are tired and the republicans will follow the same footsteps of bush nothing good will happen to iraq if mccain wins
8683168 ever since i was a child ive always had this image about the u s its the land of equality
8683169 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
8683170 this is an exciting day for hockey fans in alberta and throughout canada
8683171 the bid group from alberta put forward a great plan and the site selection committee was particularly impressed with the bids focus on making tickets affordable for all hockey fans
8683172 ni las ca das ni los neum ticos merman mi confianza
8683173 un pilotaje mejor con m s confianza y mayor rendimiento
8683174 si no fuese por los problemas con las gomas quiz tendr a el cuarto puesto un poco m s asegurado pero tambi n hubo ca das y malos resultados as que pensar en la tercera plaza tambi n se antoja complicado
8683175 una pista menos cr tica que laguna seca y brno as que en principio deber amos estar m s cerca de los bridgestone
8683176 las pruebas en brno fueron bien para m y para mi pilotaje y para michelin porque probamos nuevas gomas que mejoraron el rendimiento si esos neum ticos nuevos van a funcionar aqu eso ya es otra historia
8683177 porque en las carreras siempre suceden cosas imprevistas me marco objetivos generales quedar entre los cinco primeros a final de a o pero no carrera a carrera
8683178 cuando vi c mo el lazio lo celebraba al final del partido era como si hubieran ganado la copa del mundo yo no estaba nada contento y pens esto no me volver a pasar
8683179 para nosotros es un partido muy importante y todos somos conscientes de ello
8683180 no lo afirmo porque el mundo del f tbol es una sorpresa el tr snfer es un mero tr mite burocr tico y ahora estamos en un mes muy malo por las vacaciones
8683181 s es cierto que es un futbolista que apetece mucho al consejo de administraci n y al cuerpo t cnico
8683182 el levante est en manos de unos administradores concursales que son personas que se encuentran con un pastel muy gordo y les cuesta trabajo actuar

8683184 its no longer unusual to receive an invitation prescribing a dress code of
8683185 empower teachers to create change by expanding the classroom to the world
8683186 there are a lot of things i wanted to say
8683187 i think it emboldened many of the insurance companies not just state farm all policyholders have lost some leverage as a result of this
8683188 put their lives on hold worked for months in horribly bad conditions and did an admirable job
8683189 it was not fair to them to also have to face a daily onslaught from politicians and trial lawyers attempting to cast them as criminals
8683190 what document ever produced anything incriminating about state farms claims practices none
8683191 thats the tsa not doing the right things not even doing right the things it does
8683192 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683193 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8683194 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8683195 ich sch me mich dir in die augen zu schauen du bist gekommen uns zu helfen und meine landsleute bringen deine soldaten um
8683196 lassen sie den tod unseres kameraden nicht umsonst gewesen sein
8683197 unsere vorg nger und wir haben schon eine menge geleistet um diesem land zu helfen so wie uns vor jahrzehnten nach krieg und zerst rung geholfen worden ist
8683198 stehen sie zu ihrer trauer aber lassen sie uns auch nicht vergessen dass unsere abendl ndische kultur von der vergebung gepr gt ist und lassen sie uns den weg gemeinsam weiter schreiten dieses land aufzubauen
8683199 wir stehen tief in ihrer schuld wir wissen dass sie es sind die die voraussetzung daf r schaffen dass unsere arbeit in diesem land erfolgreich sein kann
8683200 because you always wait for me to finish what im doing when its my turn to make dinner im hungry zebra
8683201 yes last year brutus raised the dead had to fight off a troupe of zombies in our basement

8683205 do you two not actually care about the zombies at all
8683206 well you remember that total eclipse of the sun about a week ago
8683207 earlier i was just closing up the candy shop when i turned around and there was one of
8683208 they were making weird noises moaning sorts of noises and grinning at me i knew that they would attack me at any moment to eat my brains

8683214 so you ate one of the infected customers you idiotic mammal
8683215 am i the only one here who finds something wrong with eating a person probably infected with a zombie virus
8683216 something smells what the hell is that on the floor
8683217 it involves water and rocks and whatever else she can get her hands on
8683218 are not you do know that the parsley is just for decoration right
8683219 but that doesnt mean it doesnt go in rock stew everything goes in rock stew
8683220 note that thats the only thing stopping her from putting it in the pot
8683221 you came in here shouting about zombies happy zombies they taste funny any of this ringing a bell
8683222 you cant sleep when theres a zombie epidemic going around thats just asking to be infected
8683223 id better see who it is might be someone complaining about brutus again
8683224 so its a suicidal zombie did you destroy the brain
8683225 did he say anything to you before you killed him
8683226 thats not what he said im just trying to remember
8683227 its the only way to make sure it stays dead
8683228 you didnt see it when it was alive it was definitely mindless so theres got to be something weird going on in snowtown i want to find out what
8683229 yes it has never served me wrong in grand theft auto
8683230 what and lug a friggin sledgehammer all over town i dont think so the golf club will do me fine dont worry
8683231 whee zombies dont say whee they say brains or uhhn something like that
8683232 shut up zebra you i kill people on a semi daily basis sometimes i torture them first generally i wind up soaked in the blood of other people before the day is out
8683233 a confession like that would have made anyone falter zebra even you but he just
8683234 theyre worse theyre blissfully happy citizens well have to put a stop to this
8683235 first things first we need to talk to someone who might know whats going on
8683236 were in need of his help assuming he even knows anything about this and if he doesnt hell know where to start
8683237 think katters did you see a single unaffected person here besides us
8683238 hes our best chance at some information on whats going on now behave god damn it
8683239 i think hes ah purging the contents of his stomach
8683240 what the fuck are you three doing in my house
8683241 and we thought you might be willing to help us with that
8683242 is a vampire drink no sane human would buy a bottle what with the blood content and youve got the obvious traits eye colour fangs but youre not doing too well are you are you only getting your blood intake from that swill
8683243 i can get you a reasonable supply of fresh blood enough to keep you alive for a while
8683244 that mr wilhelm is precisely what we want to know
8683245 well its just that some people were acting funny about a week ago some kind of flu epidemic or something
8683246 struck me as a cop out on the part of the doctors so i did a little investigating and it all seemed to go back to that park in ripton and ramsey you know the one
8683247 well it seemed like all the flu carriers spent a lot of time there at that park id say if theres something odd going on youd do best to start looking there
8683248 we can get to the park faster if we go this way
8683249 i know but i want to head back to westchester for a minute
8683250 you say that like i should know where you live
8683251 still i need to head back over there to uh check something
8683252 no just hoping i have an excuse to kill her
8683253 jake oedipus killed his father to have sex with his mother
8683254 we have a job to do god damn it and your wild accusations arent even helping now give me a hand breaking into my mothers mysterious and incredibly creepy factory so i can murder her in cold blood and for the love of god dont even suggest that sex enters into the equation at all okay
8683255 erika doesnt get hung over shes too drunk for that
8683256 and i never felt as good as how i do right now especially now that my favourite daughter is here i was just thinking about you
8683257 you just got here we should have tea you can tell me all about how your business is going
8683258 you two stay here and chat and jake and i will go deal with the ack
8683259 my favourite soon to be son in law isnt going anywhere
8683260 i think that if you hadnt just killed her your mother would be proud
8683261 shell be back shes always back you cant keep a good erika down and you cant kill erika forever wherever there is torture to be done and wherever there is alcohol to be had there is an erika to do and have she here ill show you erika zebras got vodka in his pocket
8683262 you were a brainwashed stoner zombie so we killed you well i killed you
8683263 the people of snowtown are acting a little funny jake thinks theyre zombies zebra thinks theyre stoned i think theyre brainwashed so
8683264 anyways we were just heading to the park to figure out what was up and put a stop to all this you know happiness when i figured that you were probably one of the infected and i might get to kill you
8683265 but mom cant i go stop the zombie hordes first
8683266 but after that youre restricted to your room for a week
8683267 its about time we finally got on with this mission
8683268 well no but it seemed like a good idea at the time
8683269 im not sure how you could possibly think anything to do with erika is ever a good idea
8683270 im not sure how you could possibly think that yerface is a good idea
8683271 its right there dont even tell me you dont see that
8683272 look lets just get you two home and we can try to deal with the brainwashed stoner zombie hordes tomorrow
8683273 oh well if thats the case i was expecting something bigger
8683274 we cant be sure that its behind whats going on
8683275 i think that would be a good idea we cant know what this bug can do if we just you know kill it
8683276 you think it could be a benevolent space bug with like the secrets to eternal life and shit like that
8683277 ive seen enough b movies to consider the possibility yes
8683278 that bug just infected harry with like happy juice or something
8683279 i couldnt help but notice you seem to be infecting the entirety of the city with something
8683280 heavens no youve got it all wrong i just infect a small fraction of the population then they become contagious and infect the rest of the city for me eventually the entire planet will be a part of the mutual symbiotic spread of psychic vibrations
8683281 you really are quite attached to this headpiece arent you
8683282 i just dont want any of your insides on it
8683283 no offence or anything but we have to kill you
8683284 its just that youve gone and made everyone happy we cant stand for such things
8683285 are you going to give the hat back or not
8683286 why werent we affected by the bugs happy juice if it was transferred via people infected
8683287 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
8683288 your responsibilities include cooking staying skinny wearing sexy things around the house and doing whatever your man tells you to do because moore writes heres a little secret ladies men never really ask for anything
8683289 those dudes that think their woman just comes out to get a book signed are probably in for a rude awakening as im hugging them theyre whispering right in my ear so im loving it
8683290 if he hadnt put his name on the book i wouldve thought my ex fiance wrote it
8683291 this is the first study to show their parabens accumulation in human tissues it demonstrates that if people are exposed to these chemicals then the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies their detection in human breast tumours is of concern since parabens have been shown to be able to mimic the action of the female hormone estrogen estrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours it would therefore seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide range of cosmetics applied to the breast area including deodorants
8683292 it is welcome additional information and we will want to examine the findings in detail

8683295 empower teachers to create change by expanding the classroom to the world
8683296 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8683297 if we didnt they would not have been able to carry on and we would have been up for that amount to pay the players anyway
8683298 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman if it withdrew could have impacted on other provincial unions
8683299 we are seeking further information before we think about challenging the nzru
8683300 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683301 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8683302 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8683303 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8683304 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8683305 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8683306 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8683307 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8683308 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8683309 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683310 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683311 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8683312 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8683313 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8683314 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8683315 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8683316 the production team has stepped up their game creatively as proven by the strong ratings

8683318 the study confirmed that olive leaf extract efla 943 has antihypertensive properties in humans
8683319 this works showed that taking a 1000mg dose has substantial effects in people with borderline hypertension

8683321 cluster allowed us to measure the gradient of the magnetic field and see how it was changing direction with time
8683322 we are beginning to realise just how many interactions can take place between the solar wind and the atmosphere
8683323 we can only predict these future changes if we understand the mechanisms involved
8683324 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683325 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8683326 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8683327 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8683328 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8683329 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8683330 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683331 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8683332 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8683333 he is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital

8683337 an additional daily serving of fruit juice increased the likelihood of developing diabetes by 18 percent
8683338 this is a significant finding particularly because of the large subject pool studied and the high rate of risk linking fruit juice drinks and diabetes risk
8683339 the benefits of high orac fruits do not overcome the high risk of obesity and diabetes associated with ingestion of fruit juices high orac antioxidants can be found in spices berries and legumes

8683343 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8683344 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
8683345 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation
8683346 but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
8683347 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
8683348 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the details we are merely keeping in touch with the parties can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
8683349 it is not possible to conduct coherent foreign policy if senior officials are freelancing
8683350 another angle to this is that when it has milked something like a freeway or
8683351 ive been hearing so much about local food recently and its got me thoroughly confused what exactly is the difference between local organic and sustainable food and how does urban farming tie into all of this what should i be eating and focusing on for health purposes
8683352 there are ways to get what we need and leave nature in better shape than when we found it
8683353 freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community
8683354 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683355 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8683356 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8683357 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8683358 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8683359 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8683360 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8683361 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8683362 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683363 if it seems too good to be true it probably is
8683364 the important thing is making a good start we took one point from the first three games last season and weve got to do better
8683365 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8683366 we know it wont be easy but we know liverpool from p laying them last year that could be an advantage for us but also for them
8683367 romanian football has come on a lot and fiorentina were semi finalists in last seasons uefa cup and had a good season in italy well have to get points pretty much everywhere
8683368 rhode island is in the nose bleeds how does this happen they told me its because they went for barack obama and rhode island went for hillary
8683369 they asked for a shout out on the air and they got it they came over like 10 times and said thank you thank you this is a big week for guam
8683370 i always say that bill is my tv husband and i married well
8683371 the energy is palpable it doesnt matter what your party affiliation is just being around these people who care so much about process and their country on the floor in particular its contagious the sheer excitement i think its good for the human spirit just to be in the middle of all that positive energy i look forward to seeing the same next week in st paul
8683372 you get these molds i have small ear canals they tell me so its even harder for me to get these things in my ears
8683373 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8683374 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8683375 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8683376 what should i do to make sure my email marketing campaign is a success
8683377 we think we can get clean renewable power but we dont think this contract is necessarily the way to get it
8683378 here is the opportunity for us finally to tap into renewable energy in east texas where transmission congestion has not been an issue
8683379 talking through the language of the bullet should be stopped

8683394 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683395 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8683396 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8683397 after thorough consideration it would be too dangerous to do so
8683398 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8683399 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8683400 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government
8683401 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683402 guys are visual so when a girl is dressing to show off wearing tight pants low cut shirts etc it is hard for guys because they are stimulated by what they see
8683403 s tart respecting yourself and your guy friends by dressing modestly
8683404 the colorful graphics will catch their attention and the thought provoking stories and facts on the inside will challenge them to change the way they think about sex outside of marriage
8683405 women have described it to me as the most awful thing they have ever been through women often block out the memory of it and regret having aborted their baby not only do these women have lives haunted by their abortion but they also have an increased risk of infertility miscarriage and premature babies there is also a risk of breast cancer in women who have an abortion trying to hide your pregnancy with abortion only leaves you alone to cope with all the depression pain and regret that follow
8683406 fight the dragon of sexual temptation while their ladies watch in wonder and admiration
8683407 god made guys to be the leaders that means that they lead in relationships
8683408 paying your bills serving your country when called paying your taxes going to a job you dont like to support a family you love
8683409 im not laughing at these diseases im laughing at the idea that you can have casual premarital sex with no negative consequences and you know something young people thats what youre laughing at you agree with me
8683410 every high school im in without exception everywhere in this nation every high school im in i will have a girl write me e mail me or come right up to me and say this well my mom found out i was having sex and so she put me on the pill or depo the shot fill in the blank what is that protecting that girl from what does birth control protect you from pregnancy is what that protects you from that drug that hormone that pill that shot that this girl is taking has just made her 10 times more likely to contract a disease than if she were not taking that drug this girl could end up sterile or dead thanks mom glad you cared
8683411 designed to control young peoples sexual behavior by instilling in them feelings of dread guilt and embarrassment
8683412 whats so wrong is that they start this conversation by saying im your friend they ingratiate themselves into the teen world create a personal relationship with them and then give this information theyre giving blatant misinformation to teens in an attempt to control their behavior and thats just wrong
8683413 these are old age messages the conservative movement has been putting out there
8683414 it wasnt long ago that these were the same messages that were given to rape victims who were blamed for what they wore and thats pretty dangerous to still have out there
8683415 much of what theyre going to consume from the media is going to be inaccurate so we need to help them figure that out and the biases whatever they are
8683416 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683417 gustav is on track to pose a sizeable threat to both upstream and downstream production capacity
8683418 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released
8683419 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8683420 it would be very difficult to be in a short position today and tomorrow
8683421 there is the u s labour day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness
8683422 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683423 i was enjoying some turkey chili with david broder yesterday
8683424 there is no reason for so many journalists to be here
8683425 there is a lot of sensitive material in this room
8683426 they told me i had to go downstairs to have a smoke
8683427 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683428 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8683429 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8683430 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8683431 installing a new government could demotivate the security sector reform process if we say well reform and then nothing happens that will be very dangerous
8683432 guinea bissau has more generals than africas most populous nation nigeria
8683433 many members of the military and the police havent been paid in two months
8683434 you dont want military officers having to sell coffee in the streets to survive thats a recipe for disaster
8683435 drug trafficking is a big threat here and it will undermine everything we do to build peace here if it is not tackled
8683436 key people such as the ministers of defence and of justice have not changed and the new government has given assurance that it will not change ongoing plans

8683439 residents decided to avenge a man who had been beaten up earlier the same day and set upon the miners deeming them responsible
8683440 anything could happen and not much is being done about it
8683441 there is a problem between the groups originating from here the tshokwe lunda kahonde nungu dembo and kalwena and the sanga baheke who come from the adjacent province its ridiculous to allow people to create the same situation that led to the killings in 1962 and 1991
8683442 the sanga and the baheke are fighting the others because they want to keep the town of kolwezi which the new set up takes away from them and places in the mini province of lualaba

8683446 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

8683450 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
8683451 the transformation of a vaudeville era theater in serious disrepair with only one working light bulb to the linchpin of a revitalized downtown is nothing short of exemplary
8683452 the preservation of the historic theater and arcade as well as the adaptive reuse of the adjacent department store has delivered a heightened sense of place and history as well as state of the art performance spaces
8683453 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
8683454 talking through the language of the bullet should be stopped
8683455 we dont know for sure because nobody is keeping tabs of the dead
8683456 what we do know is we have 155 live penguins we are treating for oil intoxication
8683457 who paid for the winebox inquiry yours truly i would never have thought tau henare would have the temerity to raise that question shame on the member i had to carry the whole can by myself
8683458 a signal that the inter party talks are heading towards a hard rock and that the state machinery is reactivating itself
8683459 they are being very rough and unreasonable they are threatening us with arrest and saying that our gathering is illegal
8683460 as you all know i said very early on that my sights were a different place and i did not want to be considered
8683461 i do support john mccain we are certainly friends and i think he has a lot of good options and im told thats hes made the decision
8683462 its been really overwhelming in the last week or so
8683463 i do not have a plane ticket to ohio tomorrow
8683464 let me just end by saying i appreciate everything that you have said
8683465 i am going to go through this election helping the people who are running in this election i think that they deserve that but after this election i will be beginning to put in place the timetable to take the next step
8683466 its a sad sad attempt by a chicago union to infiltrate the milwaukee market
8683467 obviously now its a popular place because of the harley 105th but weve been out there before too
8683468 we would like it if people would patronize other places
8683469 la discipline de son lectorat et de son appareil militant
8683470 we know who looks like they are the leaders but they need to do it when it really counts and sunday is when it really starts counting
8683471 its not always going to be positive stuff there are going to be things that go wrong and well see how they respond thats one of the things weve gotten a lot better at the last two years we didnt get down when things didnt go right we just kept plugging away and expected good things to happen
8683472 its always important to get off to a good start
8683473 you never want to dig yourself a hole early i think weve got firepower but whether it will perform as firepower in games is what we need to see
8683474 they always look at the quarterback regardless of whether hes focused as the team leader or not he is a team leader on offense tony dixon garry williams braxton kelley micah johnson marcus mcclinton trevard lindley jeremy jarmon who knows who knows who will have the guts to make things happen in those situations
8683475 im tired of seeing us go against each other i want to see us hit somebody else
8683476 i can think of no better name for the ship than the man who stood a few metres away from where i am standing today john george diefenbaker
8683477 he understood that to truly fulfill our national dream we must accept the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by our north
8683478 were not saying we dont welcome more federal infrastructure military development
8683479 if were not going to get our kids through school the involvement of inuit in economic development will continue to be slow
8683480 requires a rethinking of what early urbanism may have been like in diverse and variant forms
8683481 we are also deeply shocked and anguished to hear of the atrocities and violence meted out to the innocent christians and churches in orissa as a backlash of the sorrowful event
8683482 and we are praying for an immediate halt to the violence
8683483 what is most disturbing is that these attacks seem to be well organized and orchestrated
8683484 we have reports that the vhp have actually held strategy meetings in order to plan and coordinate this campaign of violence against peaceful christian families and churches
8683485 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our bible college campus and trying to protect our people
8683486 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
8683487 we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time
8683488 we also have approximately 200 to 300 that were previously on layoff
8683489 so tomorrow if theres a need for 20 more employees theyre calling them
8683490 with our volumes being down theres obviously going to be some idle employees in our manufacturing plants
8683491 by being creative with our work force and how were operating aggressively managing our costs and overhead
8683492 our existing contracts are in place the volumes of what they are though have been reduced as demand has slowed
8683493 one of the key reasons that weve probably managed quite well compared to our competitors and other manufacturers is that we have strategically diversified not only in our customers but in our products
8683494 houve muita suspeita ao longo dos anos sobre o que acontece com essas plantas
8683495 ele um homem do clero e por isso muitas pessoas n o querem pensar nada de errado mas francamente se algu m tem uma grande planta o em seu jardim muito improv vel que fique apenas admirando suas propriedades horticulturais
8683496 any of us as republicans could ever have believed six weeks ago or even two weeks ago
8683497 people in this country are very skeptical and suspicious of who is barack obama and what does he stand for
8683498 i think its going to be close and i think john mccain is going to win im going to campaign very strongly and passionately for him
8683499 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683500 were hoping that the last time it was here it had a good burst of meteors that shot out with a bit of force as ice from the comet vaporized
8683501 for a given comet we dont know physically what happened
8683502 youve got to have an active comet actively producing meteors we dont know that this one is
8683503 21 leaders have been killed and many houses have been burned down
8683504 less than 400 000 non indigenous inhabitants of the state
8683505 only a continuous territory ensures the rights of physical and cultural reproduction and integral maintenance of customs and traditions
8683506 it is true that no one likes rate increases especially in these difficult economic times but like everything else in life these things do occur on occasion
8683507 have the ability to ask questions specific to their own organizational concerns directly of the appropriate people within sap as well as opportunities to offer alternative ideas
8683508 saps initial program had it adjust in 2009 to 22 but asug was able to convince sap that this was not in the best interest of our members
8683509 specific focus on innovation and protection of investment in sap

8683511 i like her to portray the love interest of dickwell thrust in his new motion picture
8683512 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8683513 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8683514 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8683515 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8683516 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8683517 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency
8683518 weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand
8683519 i came down tonight to see whats going on and found out there is nothing going out
8683520 its a very emotional time for me and i am going to try and get something else but it doesnt look good
8683521 its mixed emotions i am not going to be able to attend the funeral but i am also angry with zoom
8683522 they must have known something was going on as i only booked it yesterday
8683523 you need to go see dr oswald dont call just drive straight over there
8683524 im sorry but i feel like im in a movie of someone elses life i just dont believe you
8683525 well you are dont worry its not as bad as it seems youll be okay
8683526 i had her do the test twice just to be sure
8683527 go straight to dr oswalds drive right over its much better than waiting for a tubal pregnancy to send you to the hospital
8683528 we dont hold elections in august we hold them in november
8683529 so you know as we move forward out of this convention were not expecting a bump but we feel frankly that weve made a lot of progress this week
8683530 we expect that probably after our convention after john mccains v p pick after their convention that this race will probably be in a very similar place to where it is
8683531 expressionist bass fx3022 verf gen jeweils ber einen eigenen 4 inch subwoofer sowie einen 1 5 inch treiber der f r kristallklaren sound sorgt

8683533 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8683534 with so many modes of communication available these days its difficult to keep track of your partners whereabouts or who theyre chatting to and when
8683535 flirting is age old but the fact that it can now be tracked on your phone makes a nervous partner a paranoid text checker
8683536 the avon womens empowerment bracelet was created to raise awareness about the need to speak out against the violence that affects women globally
8683537 leering at her and saying i want to fuck you
8683538 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8683539 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzontee il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8683540 one rumor on which mariotti would not comment had him bound for boston and an array of multimedia opportunities how he would find flaws in a city with defending champs in basketball and baseball is anyones guess
8683541 we wish jay well and will miss him not personally of course but in the sense of noticing he is no longer here at least for a few days
8683542 the most environmentally sustainable political convention in modern american history
8683543 sort of an indulgence to pay for your carbon sins
8683544 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term
8683545 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8683546 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8683547 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8683548 ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8683549 power of our examples versus the examples of our power
8683550 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on ones convictions
8683551 we have 22 of our 38 facilities in guelph so the vast majority of the impact would be felt in guelph but its not limited just to ontario
8683552 each of the general managers is assessing the work force every day and then assessing any layoff numbers they are temporary and our goal is to get people back as quickly as possible so that numbers going to always be in flux
8683553 were at a point now with the volume reductions being what they are that weve had no choice but to start looking at our workforce and conducting temporary layoffs
8683554 he was captured at the airport he had just returned from lebanon with his family
8683555 we strongly condemn this operation against one of the highest officials of the committee who had done good work
8683556 coalition forces captured a man suspected of working within the highest echelons of the special groups criminals
8683557 it is not enough to restrict the death penalty to cases of murder or aggravated robbery
8683558 the death penalty must be abolished in its entirety because it has never been proven to be a deterrent its maintenance on the statute books violates the spirit of the truth and reconciliation commission trc
8683559 the government says it is committed to the implementation of the trcs recommendations yet it is backtracking on one key issue the abolition of the death penalty this sends conflicting signals
8683560 the time is now to mount our campaign mobilising abolitionist campaigners and civil society to continue this campaign the constitutional review commission must be made to understand
8683561 when you consider that we have come out of a war that consumed many lives i think it is appropriate some of the punitive laws are kept on our statute books though with some adjustments
8683562 the death penalty cannot altogether be abolished because crimes like murder are still being committed
8683563 there are no facilities for recreation and skills training for death row inmates this is inhuman and degrading once in the cell on death row you are isolated deprived of basic services and psychologically tortured
8683564 they all get normal rations of meals toiletries and supplementary diets in fact the prisoners on death row get better diets than ordinary convicts the prison laws do not discriminate against death row inmates
8683565 there are no workshops no libraries or recreational facilities for inmates and this in no way helps the prisoners to be reformed
8683566 we consider it mental torture and a clear denial of their rights to a speedy dispensation of justice
8683567 justice delayed is justice denied these people must have their appeals heard or be released without any further delays
8683568 i can come out here and do whatever i want to do if i was in the city i would probably be getting into trouble
8683569 now i can tell whether it is a haulage truck a bus or passenger vehicle with the same ease with which politicians and local leaders have let us down
8683570 promised grain deliveries never materialise week in and week out perhaps it is because the elections are over we dont know
8683571 due to their ngos inability to operate only 280 000 people of the 1 5 million in need of food assistance are being reached with distributions
8683572 we are starving and no one seems to care about our plight our livestock will soon perish
8683573 what we need is grain not affordable hampers containing luxuries like sugar cooking oil and toothpaste
8683574 we have survived on sadza a thick maize meal porridge as a staple who wants clean and healthy teeth when he is starving
8683575 they have to choose whether to barter their livestock to meet immediate needs in the form of grain or face the prospect of failing to prepare their fields for lack of draught power in time for the onset of the wet season
8683576 we applaud and are committed to efforts such as the child health campaign but we cannot forget that a growing number of children are suffering daily because of the ngo ban
8683577 every day that such an important lifeline of humanitarian aid for children remains cut off puts the children of this country at ever greater risk
8683578 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8683579 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8683580 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries

8683587 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8683588 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them

8683594 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8683595 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
8683596 similar to youtube content can debut in the marketplace after only three simple steps register as a merchant upload and describe your content and publish it
8683597 we chose the term market rather than store because we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available
8683598 i was young na ve enough to think i would see that in 5 10 years
8683599 then you see leaders killed you see police brutality residential segregation in cities about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this this is something for my grandchildren
8683600 weve had disappointments since then but if someone told me i would be here
8683601 when people say nothing has changed i feel like saying come walk in my shoes
8683602 we have one foot in both eras were still living out a lot of anger
8683603 people ask what has changed and i say dont trivialize the changes
8683604 im seeing the fruit of the changes that began in 1964
8683605 were going to be moving to mile high stadium tomorrow and i want to let you know why
8683606 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody that wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8683607 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives

8683612 the first reaction from io was to sue rather than to work through the system
8683613 they didnt find out whether veoh worked to protect copyright which it appears they do relative to the digital millennium copyright act
8683614 what the supreme court said in the grokster and napster cases is that you have to look at the business model
8683615 the files on napster were something like 95 or 98 percent unauthorized copyright material that was illegally posted to the site there copyright owners in that case demonstrated that napster and grokster were both well aware of the piracy on their site there was no evidence that this was the case at veoh
8683616 youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement
8683617 id be hard pressed to say that the decision is a good precedent for viacom
8683618 i think it was a complete victory for veoh and for the 11 or so other user generated sites that have copyright cases pending the decision was pretty much a vindication for sites that comply with the dmca
8683619 very influential decision because its the first to rule specifically on user generated sites

8683621 the no child left behind act of 2001 requires states to set forth objectives of proficiency in reading and mathematics participation in testing and attendance and graduation rates schools and school divisions that meet the standards are considered having made adequate yearly progress of those that do not those schools that receive title i federal funding face sanctions including being forced to offer after school tutoring to allow parents to transfer children to a school that did make ayp and other consequences if a school repeatedly fails to meet ayp the operation of the school could potentially be taken over by a private agency

8683625 se qualcuno vuole uccidere uno di noi dovra passare sul cadavere di tutti gli altri

8683634 we knew there was something we could make a game out of but we didnt just want to abandon what everyone had been playing around with
8683635 the great thing about line rider is its elegant simplicity
8683636 we knew there was so much we could do to it but we didnt want to ruin it by making it too complex
8683637 he came out for about a month and a half
8683638 we put him up across the street and have him come over every day he and our lead engineer here started playing around with the next update of the flash version
8683639 after they did that we sat down and bounced around ideas like game design stuff and what we wanted to feature in the new games
8683640 you just push a button and it spits out an avi
8683641 i started watching these videos come out on youtube and called up techdawg
8683642 we had him come here to help us with course design he amazingly has really good design sense he flew out for about three weeks and sat down and went over game design ideas and tried to figure out what we wanted out of story mode maps
8683643 the differences with the wii are basically in the user interface

8683650 people dont hack accounts by using programs and any other bullshit that you hear around xbox live
8683651 we can confirm that joes account was compromised representatives from microsoft aided joe in swiftly resolving the issue
8683652 the republicans are immediately going to steal the spotlight and probably counter any bounce that would be there
8683653 mccain could come out of the convention with a five point lead and if it sticks around through october thats hard to shake then mccain is the leader and people are wondering why obamas losing
8683654 i think it is possible that mccain people will start out at the convention drawing contrasts with obama
8683655 it was a bland choice because nobody knows who he is
8683656 youve got poor job approval for president george w bush youve got the iraq war and the economy when you take the sum of all of these issues it suggests a larger lead for obama
8683657 we are no longer a christian nation we are also a muslim nation
8683658 whatever we once were we are no longer a christian nation at least not just we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation and a buddhist nation and a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers
8683659 cristi adkins says she was a gung ho clinton activist when some friends an informal group of christians from the south asked her for help in responding to an obama speech that offended them
8683660 i truly fear an obama presidency this guys so dangerous who needs al qaida
8683661 thomas says he and his brother had never produced a political ad when adkins came to them he says adkins originally wanted to depict obama with devil horns juxtaposed with images of hitler the brothers declined
8683662 i certainly didnt want to completely slander somebody especially a guy that might be the next president then i get audited every year or something
8683663 i might have said can you put a subliminal shadow in i dont know that i said put devil horns

8683667 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different
8683668 were surprised by how many people opted to get full albums
8683669 but it s a good value proposition talk about something that s been lost and forgotten
8683670 to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries
8683671 ele naturalmente um orador muito talentoso mas ele tamb m trabalhou muito duro por isso
8683672 obama n o estaria onde est hoje sem o discurso de 2004

8683688 your message should be it is now under investigation and anyone who has any specific knowledge about the break out should contact the investigators
8683689 with notes indicating that in fact we do not have a gang or violence issues in our provincial correctional system
8683690 securing the future the saskatchewan partys plan and new ideas
8683691 hiring more corrections workers to eliminate drugs and gangs in jails
8683692 banning gang colours and paraphernalia in jails by instituting jail uniforms
8683693 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8683694 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8683695 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials

8683697 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter

8683703 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8683704 showed that being young is not necessarily being inexperienced or not being ready to lead
8683705 i think we all know how productive and positive the clinton administration was for americans
8683706 he ripped the mask off the face of the republicans
8683707 are so good at defining the democrats that was nice to give them a taste of their own medicine
8683708 president clinton tied john mccain to the current state of affairs and urged democrats and americans to elect obama as president of the u s to avert four more years of the same policies
8683709 in my view the obama train just left springfield illinois en route to 1600 pennsylvania avenue and anyone especially the mccain campaign who had hoped president clinton was not going to be onboard must be really disappointed
8683710 while i admit to being very apprehensive about the biden selection after tonight im sold
8683711 obama and biden make a formidable team i almost feel sorry for mccain and whomever come the debates i said almost
8683712 you dont have to worry about which joe biden youre going to get on which day he is a person that speaks with honesty and trust a person you can believe in
8683713 joe biden found his footing and drove home the message we need change
8683714 i think he gave a heartfelt speech that was appealing to the heartland to those blue collar voters people keep on talking about
8683715 he stumbles over his words a bit and thats fine by me as long as he has the intelligence and broad vision that a leader needs and i believe he does
8683716 answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century

8683723 since tests havent begun yet we dont know what the ailment is
8683724 he comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health
8683725 no law is going to prevent a woman from giving birth sic when shes raped or has incest no law ever its the same thing with the parental notification every bill has an abuse clause in it every bill has if youre afraid to tell your parents if theres incest if theres violence in your home you can go to the courts and theyll decide whether you can have the abortion not your parents ok every law says it
8683726 but the crazies the pro abortion people the people who worship at the altar of reproductive rights dont care they want abortion on demand any kind of abortion at any time
8683727 on the date that the states are recognized by the united states supreme court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy
8683728 supreme court reverses in whole or in part roe v wade
8683729 p rohibits abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother
8683730 i think theyre gonna look at the republican platform and see the opposite side of the zealotry and see that you know when youve got a platform telling women that they have no control over their bodies when theyre the victims of rape or incest that they have absolutely no choices even early on in their pregnancy i think that that is going to you know were one justice away from that potentially becoming the law
8683731 i just called about schecters comment about abortion and sort of your reaction to it when he mentioned rape and incest being a huge issue for women in the suburbs i find that to be a red herring issue that has absolutely nothing to do with abortion as an issue
8683732 you know the spectrum has gone too far to the left and im gonna readjust my opinion to try to get it under control
8683733 in the end there was a move to weaken the recommendation to be basically forward looking and not focus on any particular project

8683737 tra poco oltrepasserai il muro ma non temere ephram ti difender
8683738 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8683739 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8683740 ogni santa notte ogni volta che chiudo gli occhi lei li ogni volta che la mia mente vuota lei la occupa oh wiliam quando tu non ci sei io mi sento cos inutile cos debole e lei mi logora dallinterno mi sento come se fossi divisa in miliardi di coriandoli tutti senza senso e tu non so come riesci a dargli quel senso riesci a farmi sentire che esisto quando invece io non so pi chi sono non lo so pi
8683741 ho visto te fra lei sue braccia ho sentito il male che ti ha fatto dalla prima volta che sei entrato in questa stanza penso che questa sia colpa tua
8683742 tu hai risvegliato la parte peggiore di me quella che mi faceva male ho rivisto frammenti del suo e del tuo passato ho visto come la guardavi ed anche se non volevo credere che fossi tu quel ragazzo inconsciamente io invidiavo natalie perch so che non potrai mai guardarmi come guardavi lei
8683743 ho sentito la sua perfidia lei mi perseguita mi dice che non sono niente e che tu gli apparterrai per leternit
8683744 ero gi un vampiro allepoca lei non lo sapeva o almeno io non glielo avevo confessato me ne innamorai perdutamente nellistante i cui la vidi
8683745 era bellissima fui superficiale a limitarmi allapparenza cominciai a frequentare il suo castello ogni giorno ogni notte sorgeva proprio qui questa era la sua stanza
8683746 decisi di dirle la verit ero stupidamente sicuro che lei mi amasse solo ora so quanto mi stessi sbagliando non so come ma venne a conoscenza della mia natura da sola allepoca circolavano strane dicerie sui vampiri si diceva che mangiando le nostre carni si poteva ottenere limmortalit senza linconveniente della dannazione
8683747 ma io non volevo vedere non volevo sentire volevo solo lei lultima sera che la vidi nella sua stanza fui attaccato da un esercito di vampiri allora non potevo pi sfuggire dalla realt
8683748 ero forte ma non cos forte per sfuggire ad un esercito lei era li di fronte a me mentre gli altri mi tenevano in modo che non potessi sfuggire non so come riusc a farsi ubbidire da quei vampiri non so nemmeno cosa promise loro in cambio mi disse il suo desiderio ed il suo intento mi aveva venduto ad una nobile famiglia del tempo in cambio di qualche trancio della mia carne lei voleva limmortalit la bellezza eterna lunica cosa importante per lei mi disse che avrebbe mangiato le miei carni che in questo modo avrebbe esaudito anche il mio desiderio essere parte di lei per sempre capii che era pazza che ero stato uno stupido a cercare qualcosa di cos profondo come lamore in una come lei ale era cos fredda cos vuota
8683749 mi fece rinchiudere nelle segrete del suo palazzo quello fu il suo unico errore piegai le sbarre di quella prigione avevo un solo desiderio ucciderla
8683750 rotornai nelle sue stanze alla mia vista i suoi occhi si riempirono di paura di terrore e ne fui felice perch in qualche modo ero riuscito a fargliprovare almeno unemozione alla fine non fui in grado di ucciderla
8683751 la baciai unultima volta cercando di trasmetterle tutto lodio che avevo tutto il ribrezzo me ne andai e non la rividi mai pi ora so cosa le accadde
8683752 lunica cosa che seppi dopo essermene andato che il suo esercito fin col distruggersi da solo soltanto uno si salv a quello scempio gli augur di subire tutte le pene dellinferno gli promise che lavrebbe perseguitata ovunque in ongi vita qualunque forma avesse assunto lui lavrebbe perseguitata sarebbe stato la sua paura pi grande
8683753 poi mi allontanai cos tanto da quel luogo da questo luogo che lei per me non divenne altro che un amaro ricordo un ricordo nitido del mio orgoglio ferito del mio cuore infranto un ricordo che mi perseguitava ed al quale non potevo sottrarmi la mia punizione per aver assaggiato il frutto proibito poi decisi di tornare ed te che ho incontrato tu risvegliasti tutto quel dolore che mi sembrava di tenere sepolto tu eri identica a lei to odiai per questo ti odiai con tutte le mie forze inizialmente pensavo addirittura che tu fossi lei che in qualche modo era riuscita a restare in vita io lo speravo
8683754 gi non sei nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile a lei per fortuna
8683755 e tu mi portasti qui qui dove tutto era cominciato decisi allora che qui anche tutto sarebbe finito ma tu non eri una normale ragazza di questa epoca
8683756 avvertisti subito la mia presenza e questo mi spavent ma ormai avevo deciso tu mi avresti liberato da tutte le mie pene poi a tutto questo si aggiunse il tuo profumo cos dolce cos intenso e la ciliegina sulla torta pensai sarebbe stato tutto pi semplice naturale io ero il vampiro tu la preda ma i tuoi occhi il tuo modo di fare il dubbio cominci a d insinuarsi nei miei pensieri tu non eri lei mi sentii un mostro eppure capii immediatamente di non essere pi capace di allontanarmi da te tu eri una perfida illusione per me lillusione che natalie fosse ancora li per me che fosse diversa
8683757 avanti avanti fa quello per cui sei venuto quella dannata sera mettiamo fine a questo stupido gioco
8683758 ti sto solo chiedendo di rendere concreto ci che in realt hai gi fatto
8683759 va bene se ci che vuoi far ci per cui venni quella sera
8683760 era per questo che ero venuto quella sera non ti avrei mai morsa
8683761 no resister perch ora tu sei pi importante del mio istinto tu sei pi importante di tutto
8683762 voglio che tu lo sappia non sei come lei tu sei tutto ci che ho sempre desiderato tu sei lamore della mia eternit
8683763 the vampire and me 2 quando passato e presente si mescolano
8683764 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8683765 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

8683829 if the election to u s congress were being held today for whom would you vote colleen callahan democrat sheldon schafer green party or aaron schock republican the three names were rotated in order as the question was asked of voters
8683830 public opinion strategies is one of the most respected and accurate polling firms in the nation
8683831 some people questioned the validity of the polls we released in the primary campaign and even scoffed that aarons numbers couldnt possibly be that high but aarons margin of the vote confirmed those poll findings
8683832 without question the only poll that counts is on election day
8683833 that is why aaron schock is working exceptionally hard to earn new support each and every day just as he has done in each campaign
8683834 my brothers been in the army for about four years now and he was serving out there
8683835 obviously when i knew i was going out to afghanistan the chance to meet my brother was one of the main things on my mind unfortunately when i got there i found out he was on the other side of afghanistan and it looked like i wouldnt get a chance to meet him afghanistans a big country and people were telling me that it was just too difficult to link up it was a bit of a shame but i just got on with it and put it out of my mind for a few days
8683836 the whole trip lasted about 10 days but we spent probably seven or eight days actually in afghanistan
8683837 we spent a day in kuwait on the way out there and a day in kuwait on the way back it was absolutely incredible to be honest even going to kuwait was a bit of a culture shock afghanistan itself though was something amazing a very humbling experience and something ive never experienced before it was the sort of thing other civilians never get to see so i was very lucky to be given the opportunity to go out there
8683838 some of the conditions we were staying in werent exactly the ritz carlton
8683839 but then you start thinking about the sacrifices that the soldiers are making out there staying out there for months and years on end and you realize how easy youve got it we were speaking to american soldiers who had been there for 18 months and women who had five children back at home you cant complain for being out there for a week youd look like a bit of an idiot
8683840 a couple of the very remote bases that we visited out near the borders of pakistan up in the hills were a little intimidating you kind of got the feeling that if it went off youd be there on your own and a little stranded you cant dial 999 and call the police up in those kinds of places
8683841 i was amazed how well the army manage to mimic home life for the soldiers out there
8683842 they create a home away from home for these guys by putting up burger kings pizza huts and dairy queens in their army base there was also a barbershop and a supermarket it was as much of a home environment as you could get out there
8683843 the soldiers were huge fans and were very appreciative that we were there
8683844 some of them said just getting an autograph and a picture brightened up their day and gave them something to think about that made us feel quite strange to be honest
8683845 we did a little mixed martial arts demonstration for them and asked around to see if there was anything in particular they wanted to see covered we tried to gear it towards what they may want to use in their line of work so to speak we had a q and a session and sometimes did a little grappling with the guys once we sparred with the special forces and that was fun
8683846 all in all the trip was very educational for me
8683847 you read and listen to the media and they give you a clouded view of things
8683848 as soon as we got out there we had a commander sit us down and explain exactly what they were hoping to achieve out there theyre looking to build an infrastructure and an economy out there theyre looking to build roads schools hospitals and various other things so that they can eventually hand over independence to afghanistan without this work the people in afghanistan have no real future the army are simply trying to create options for them and ultimately build an economy so that the locals dont have to pick up a machine gun and fight for the taliban
8683849 at one of the bases a load of children came up to me wanting food
8683850 as a father myself i dont want to see a kid going hungry and what have you i had a little backpack with me and filled it up with little bags of cookies and stuff from the dining hall so that when i met these kids i could throw them all the things i picked up
8683851 one day a load of kids came running up behind a fence and they all spoke surprisingly good english i started throwing bags of cookies over to them and they were all going crazy after a while a few of the guards came over and told me off for feeding them they said that the kids would keep calling for food long after id left and if they didnt have anyone else to give them food theyd start stealing the metal from the fence
8683852 theyd ask me what my name was and id tell them it was michael
8683853 theyd then start shouting out michael jackson michael jackson it was pretty funny even these little eight year old kids in afghanistan know who michael jackson is it was amazing after id given them as much food as i could and told them id be leaving the kids all wanted to know what time id be back tomorrow it was heartbreaking knowing that i had a bag of food i couldnt give them and that i wouldnt be retuning tomorrow
8683854 towards the end of the trip two days before the end we were sitting down doing a demonstration and sgt murphy told everyone that id hoped to see my brother while we were out there
8683855 suddenly mid speech my brother walked out from behind the big screen and everyone gave him a huge round of applause
8683856 hell always be my clumsy little brother and i worry about him out there even though hes now a grown man and is in the army walking around with a load of guns strapped to him hes still my little brother i got some pictures with him and you couldnt wipe the smile off my face for the rest of my time there

8683860 if he runs remind me to send him a virginia state map
8683861 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8683862 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8683863 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8683864 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators
8683865 he would be the least welcome here of any democrat i could think of
8683866 i think the clintons have performed superbly under very difficult political and emotional strain
8683867 quiet and not given to self promotion a very gracious man
8683868 i had an amazing amount of luck to race for 22 years and not a drop of blood or a broken bone
8683869 always fearful and throughout his career he struggled to find a balance between the perils and pleasures of his profession
8683870 by the mid 1950s he had become americas best sports car racer

8683873 werent life threatening and he doesnt have a recurrence of cancer
8683874 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8683875 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8683876 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8683877 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8683878 it is just like a monitor on your desk only deeper
8683879 it uses an external power supply like a laptop that minimises heat issues
8683880 indeed it is so quiet that users dont notice the nose over other office monitors they wouldnt know it is on
8683881 organisations that select loco2pcs can expect to gain substantial payback through savings on their power bills estimated at 100 per pc every year
8683882 100 is not a controversial figure it is a conservative figure
8683883 in the worst case scenario when an organisation is running old pcs that are left on overnight the annual savings could be as high as 250 especially if they dont have a sleep mode indeed the whole system could completely pay for itself in two to five years

8683889 we can also confirm that we have been able to narrow down the number of customers affected by this breach to 10
8683890 we are currently contacting those customers and offering assistance as needed
8683891 purges reservations data within seven days of guest departure thereby limiting potential data exposure
8683892 we got the warning from the antivirus software and after that we turned off the systems and changed the systems
8683893 we cut off our internet connection informed it and turned everything off immediately i dont know the details of the virus it was only 10 people who were affected the clients who were hacked have been informed
8683894 what i found was on one of the top underground forums for the rbn trading network
8683895 there was an indian hacker selling a log in to best westerns systems with a screenshot saying the log in can get access to credit card numbers and card verification codes
8683896 we were calling it the second shot from the grassy knoll
8683897 we had four people in four time zones working on that problem
8683898 mark foster in taipei me in boston someone in india and someone in santa clara we had to program a workaround on the fly its in the radio something youre not supposed to touch under normal consequences
8683899 we werent hiding it everybody knew but we werent broadcasting it we figured it all out and shipped a million of them
8683900 when we announce something now that will be in play two years from now its partly to give the manufacturers something to start copying now
8683901 if you go back two years and you look at the press the xo was dismissed it was not possible then came the classmate then asus if i underestimated anything it was how fast people would copy it even if they didnt get down to the same price or didnt have the same features it was a movement a hardware trend that happened because of olpc
8683902 i am not a ceo management administration and details are my weaknesses
8683903 unless we keep designing showing the world its doable i dont think they will follow in that path
8683904 if we stop at this stage they are not going to come down enough for us to use their machines we have to push them at least one step further
8683905 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8683906 those who are considering supporting separatism should understand what dangerous consequences their actions threaten to have for world order international stability and the authority of the u n security councils decisions that took decades to build
8683907 if the kosovo precedent is used the russians can also recognise ethnic russian enclaves in places such as georgia or moldova whats good for kosovo is good for other places as well
8683908 we will operate within the law as we understand it in consultation with elections canada
8683909 our position is that elections canada has changed some of their positions since the last campaign thats our problem
8683910 we dont want to fight over the interpretation of the law
8683911 but we want to know that the interpretations clear and we want to know that its going to apply to all parties the same way and that its not going to change after the election campaign
8683912 it is true that no one likes rate increases especially in these difficult economic times but like everything else in life these things do occur on occasion
8683913 have the ability to ask questions specific to their own organizational concerns directly of the appropriate people within sap as well as opportunities to offer alternative ideas
8683914 saps initial program had it adjust in 2009 to 22 but asug was able to convince sap that this was not in the best interest of our members
8683915 specific focus on innovation and protection of investment in sap
8683916 overcome issues and keep projects on schedule and systems online
8683917 the hpx500 package with its variety of recording and off loading options is tailor made for our production environment with edit suites in three different buildings on our campus
8683918 the ease of the p2 workflow was a major reason for our decision
8683919 standardizing on dvcpro hd is a win win for us as we can purchase weekly footage from nfl films in that format
8683920 moreover btn produces all the teams pre season broadcasts in house and its a simple matter to rent trucks with dvcpro hd support
8683921 those things sometimes may be different in magnitude but theres certainly at base the same problem and i feel that i have the experience to deal with that
8683922 we need to convince voters that we as new democrats would take economic issues as seriously as we do on social issues
8683923 and that includes issues around the environment and the economy that includes issues of key investment training and all of those things which well talk to more specifically during the campaign
8683924 if the partys going to gain electoral success in this province we need to go after soft liberals soft conservative undecideds on key issues that are important to them and the environment is one of those
8683925 i believe the way you attract green voters to the ndp is by proposing good policy around the environment
8683926 firmly believed that the ndp should continue to support separate school education
8683927 its a long campaign a bit of a marathon and im pretty used to running a marathon
8683928 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
8683929 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
8683930 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called
8683931 it may well be that one of the deaths is now back into the under investigation stage because we received new testing or new evidence
8683932 i cant tell you specifically what happened in that case but i can tell you thats generally what the procedure would be
8683933 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8683934 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8683935 the active role of russia in promoting peace and co operation in the given region
8683936 we are ready we are well organized we are determined to win this election
8683937 i think we had good reason not to trigger an election before canadians learned more about what this government represents
8683938 det er gl deligt at det trods en kpmpliceret transformation fra frivilluge k destruktur til kapitalk destruktur kombineret med faldende forbrugeroptimisme er lykkedes at opretholde vores markedsposition og samtidig skabe et forbedret konomisk resultat der er i god tr d med vores forventninger
8683939 im a little bit worried about tonights event im worried that its too big its hard to be intimate and connect with the tv audience in that atmosphere and bring it down to earth its the opposite of him interacting with his kids
8683940 tennesseans have the right to know the facts about barack obamas extensive connections to bill ayers an unrepentant american terrorist whose organization bombed many buildings in the 1960s including the u s capitol
8683941 and yet as reported by several media outlets the obama campaign is engaged in a multi pronged effort to intimidate media outlets including radio and television stations into not airing information or advertisements focusing on the issue
8683942 that the server a network attached storage nas box contained unencrypted backups of cds
8683943 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was not planned to be disposed of by the company and investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations
8683944 we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8683945 a spokesman for mail source which owns graphic data put the situation down to an honest mistake
8683946 i have to be very sincere the person that makes me feel very happy also because she chose vintage was julia roberts in erin brockovich when she got the academy award
8683947 i was very excited i was not in los angeles but i saw on television and i really was excited to see her when she appeared with my dress
8683948 when i work and i create i am not very approachable to know everything i say was being recorded did irritate me

8683950 it was amazing to kind of hang out with valentino and giancarlo for two years
8683951 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8683952 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8683953 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8683954 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8683955 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8683956 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8683957 i dont know if this is a turning point but at least its a pause where rising fear is replaced with something more like rising uncertainty which is better than rising fear
8683958 any evidence that pessimism may have peaked at least for the moment is good news for the harper conservatives
8683959 given the close nature of the national race a few percentage points make a difference
8683960 i am scheduled to be and planning to be at the state fair tomorrow morning
8683961 sometimes you go to the line and you say lets go
8683962 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore

8683965 perspectives improving ssh style host authentication with multi path probing
8683966 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8683967 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8683968 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8683969 why it wouldnt be better for the professor to write that lecture out let students read it on their own then reserve the whole of class time for dialogue and discussion has always baffled me

8683974 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8683975 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8683976 relying exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8683977 the appropriate sides to resolve the existing problems through peaceful dialogue and apply efforts to reconciliation and promotion of negotiations
8683978 the sco member states welcome the adoption in moscow on aug 12 2008 of the six principles of resolving the conflict in south ossetia and support the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region

8684010 when i worked with frank and saw his expertise when he became available with the dismantling of ravens staff i started thinking what kind of an advantage we might gain from that given the talent level is on par with most of the teams we played we werent going to line up and beat people walking out tunnel

8684084 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8684085 showed that being young is not necessarily being inexperienced or not being ready to lead
8684086 i think we all know how productive and positive the clinton administration was for americans
8684087 he ripped the mask off the face of the republicans
8684088 are so good at defining the democrats that was nice to give them a taste of their own medicine
8684089 president clinton tied john mccain to the current state of affairs and urged democrats and americans to elect obama as president of the u s to avert four more years of the same policies
8684090 in my view the obama train just left springfield illinois en route to 1600 pennsylvania avenue and anyone especially the mccain campaign who had hoped president clinton was not going to be onboard must be really disappointed
8684091 while i admit to being very apprehensive about the biden selection after tonight im sold
8684092 obama and biden make a formidable team i almost feel sorry for mccain and whomever come the debates i said almost
8684093 you dont have to worry about which joe biden youre going to get on which day he is a person that speaks with honesty and trust a person you can believe in
8684094 joe biden found his footing and drove home the message we need change
8684095 i think he gave a heartfelt speech that was appealing to the heartland to those blue collar voters people keep on talking about
8684096 he stumbles over his words a bit and thats fine by me as long as he has the intelligence and broad vision that a leader needs and i believe he does

8684102 production capacity is a very interesting asset for every big utility in europe
8684103 the germans have huge investment plans and i think it would fit quite well but also looking to france and utilities which are further away they might also be interested in generation capacities
8684104 nuon and essent have a number of gas fired power plants which are pretty new and recent and both have an important renewables position
8684105 this will be a good opportunity for external growth in a market which is strategically located between the north the west and the southern part of europe

8684111 sen john mccain is in some ways outsmarting sen obama when it comes to internet marketing one example as of wednesday a google search for joe biden or even just biden resulted in a prominently displayed ad labeled joe biden on obama that links to sen mccains site there a video begins playing that shows sen biden criticizing sen obama during the democratic primaries the move mimics the ambush strategy that advertisers often employ buying a competitors term so that an ad for the buyers own product appears when a consumer searches for the other brand
8684112 its about time advertisers were taught to use correct terminology simply because others have gotten

8684116 it is proof of the complete commitment by sikorsky aircraft to this program and to the exploration of innovation in aviation we look forward to expanding the flight envelope for this demonstrator and will continue to conduct market analysis to determine the next steps for this important program
8684117 the teams achievement sets the stage for the next series of tests eventually leading to maximum speed it also sparks the imagination for what ultimately the technology can mean to the future of the rotorcraft industry we are far from having a product but closer than ever to realizing the potential

8684130 that woman rachael mullenix is the reason mr allen did this horrendous brutal act
8684131 what they wanted was to be together they believed her mother was in the way
8684132 he didnt have motive opportunity or will to kill barbara mullenix
8684133 hes not a violent person when you look at rachael mullenixs life the sad thing is that she was working up to this for two years
8684134 he said he didnt like her and wanted to kill her
8684135 he said he wanted to make it slow and painful
8684136 ian allen knew he didnt do anything but he decided to take the blame
8684137 they didnt believe anything he said because they knew this was not the kind of person he is
8684138 we are very concerned about the level of west nile virus activity in orange county
8684139 adding to our concern is the number of people who will celebrate labor day weekend by spending time outdoors where they may be exposed to mosquitoes
8684140 he was captured at the airport he had just returned from lebanon with his family
8684141 we strongly condemn this operation against one of the highest officials of the committee who had done good work
8684142 coalition forces captured a man suspected of working within the highest echelons of the special groups criminals
8684143 intelligence sources have implicated the captured man with multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets specifically the june 24 bombing at the sadr city district advisory council
8684144 you know it was once said of the first george bush that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second
8684145 the enthusiasm up here was just as great as if we would have been on the floor
8684146 this is a triumph of the recognition of womens fundamental rights
8684147 it will surely establish a precedent for mexico for the other states and for the region of latin america
8684148 this decision could be legal or criminal but it can never be moral

8684150 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8684151 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8684152 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8684153 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8684154 we want to express our sincere gratitude to the staff of the morgan county emergency management center in morgan county and the booker t washington community center in vigo county
8684155 by providing the facilities for our centers they have helped disaster victims in their community we deeply appreciate their generosity
8684156 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years hes been alert hes been steady
8684157 the late prime minister bhutto or her husband or it was a joint account
8684158 i think hes better than many of the others out there plus he was the husband of benazir bhutto who dreamed of a prosperous pakistan hell live out her dream or at least hell try
8684159 he may be an expert in darwinian politics but people perceive a sheer lack of leadership qualities
8684160 the refugees should have the right of return to their homeland and we are negotiating this with the israelis i have to say we are not with permanent settlement of palestinian refugees in lebanon
8684161 the camps in lebanon are part of the lebanese territories and part of the lebanese governments responsibility regarding security and non security matters
8684162 we are ready to cooperate by all means because we do not see ourselves as being in charge of security inside the camps
8684163 she could have stopped it with one finger but she didnt
8684164 we know she used that microwave as the instrument of death
8684165 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8684166 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8684167 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8684168 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly
8684169 to be recognized by our peers and to be in the company of such successful stores as hustler and castle is an honor in itself
8684170 adam amp eve has been around for nearly 40 years
8684171 we started as the first adult mail order company then were one of the first adult retailers on the internet with http www adam eve com we have a long history or firsts and i see the adam amp eve stores as the next progression in this list of successes
8684172 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8684173 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8684174 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8684175 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8684176 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8684177 i obviously respect his opinion and we get along great and were pretty close
8684178 i know his family well and his baby girl and his wife but at the same time he captains our davis cup team so who knows if thats a conflict of interest in any way shape or form with the other players
8684179 theres no way he can be davis cup captain and coach against one of his other players thats just impossible
8684180 it a permanent arrangement is not really even worth discussing because i dont think its in the realm of possibility
8684181 it was pretty obvious who would be the best fit to help me out for this just this tournament
8684182 ill probably get to that decision on a permanent coach i have a fair amount of time after this to figure it out
8684183 johns been feeling the effects of the road for a little while when we first got together it was temporary
8684184 he was kind of just helping me out and was going to help and then all of a sudden its two and a half years later i think he was spent and i was struggling and so it was an easy conversation he was just like im kind of tapped
8684185 its pretty intense day to day and im pretty intense day to day but hes been here the whole time and weve been hanging out so its not too big of a deal and well always be brothers
8684186 there is a huge amount of uncertainty as to why there are big natural swings in co2 levels
8684187 its clear from our work that the greenland ice sheet is very sensitive to carbon dioxide levels but its wrong to draw inferences about what will happen
8684188 you cant say that if you get to the level of 400 ppm the ice sheet will melt in the next hundred years because we dont know enough about the process it might be easier to create an icesheet than to melt if you reverse what you did before you dont necessarily get the same answer back
8684189 we certainly talked about the complexity of the challenges that we have in the border area the pressure that we believe needs to be applied there for lots of reasons not the least of which is the effect its having on the fight in afghanistan
8684190 a very clear need from a us standpoint and from the pakistani standpoint that we have got to figure out a way to get at this problem
8684191 is undertaking operations that were not ongoing a few months ago
8684192 i am encouraged that hes taking action and i also think its going to take some time
8684193 expectations for instantaneous results are probably a little bit too high
8684194 i was up 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 4
8684195 i was lucky that i held my serve there is more room to improve hopefully in the next match i can do better
8684196 i guess i am better at just knowing what to do on the court
8684197 i found my weapons on the court and i know when to use them
8684198 ive been working a lot on every shot i spend a lot of time on my conditioning if im faster it helps me to play my game to be aggressive on the court
8684199 i tried to go to the net more often because he was using the slice a lot
8684200 i tried to make more first serves he gets more nervous when i make my first serve
8684201 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8684202 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8684203 the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8684204 the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8684205 youll have to do the best you can we dont have subpoena power theres no argument about that
8684206 we will proceed promptly and go at least full days and maybe into the evening
8684207 im acting based on what my obligations are under that law and based upon what city council has asked me to do

8684209 coach you know you could easily have four accomplished quarterbacks in the lineup at the same time do you ever think about that
8684210 when we made the decision that todd was the guy we wanted to go with we realized we had one of our premier athletes and a big 12 caliber receiver not playing
8684211 we incorporated him into the offense and he took to it and did a great job
8684212 we hope a j can do the same at tight end
8684213 we have always tried to recruit great athletes at quarterback
8684214 and as we all know you can only get one quarterback on the field at a time especially if the one you have is pretty good
8684215 blackberry owners are some of the most groundbreaking mobile users and the bold is sure to inspire a growing number of blackberry converts
8684216 although a lot of people traditionally associate blackberry usage with business weve seen huge interest in our product from both the business and consumer segments we built eqo with this in mind so users can get the best of both worlds having a really cool app on their phone that meshes with business and pleasure
8684217 there is no state of emergency committee report to warrant the recalling of parliament earlier than the fixed date september 23 2008 following the adjournment on july 18 2008 we have had enough enough is enough on this erratic decision making with so many pertinent questions unanswered
8684218 if due process was followed why are their own ranks saying that they were only given 24 hours to study the lng gas agreement who drafted it it looks like it was drafted outside of usual legal and government process
8684219 why do we need to worry about immigration when we cannot even have our power system up thats the most basic stuff no investors in their right mind would come here because of our power situation
8684220 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8684221 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me december 6 cant get here soon enough
8684222 this is my greatest challenge when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8684223 it was a great event the last time we played
8684224 both clubs have passionate fans and were looking forward to it
8684225 the players and the fans will already be looking to that fixture on the calendar
8684226 its fabulous for celtic fans there are no easy groups there are no free passes in europe
8684227 its a mixed bag but any team that reaches the group stages has to be given respect
8684228 we are totally focused on champions league the determination is there and they are completely focused on making the final again this year
8684229 its not easy but the three teams are fairly close by and theres no challenging trips
8684230 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8684231 but were optimistic and confident we will get to the knockout stages
8684232 there were no allegations by anyone that was on the bus that there were sexual intentions involved
8684233 when they were last asked they said they did not want there to be any plea deal at all
8684234 they wanted to see the case go to trial so that justice could be done
8684235 its our position that theyve accepted and admitted to assaulting the victim by the alford plea
8684236 theyve been denying that since day one trying to make the victim the bad person when thats not true
8684237 we have in 50 years turned our ocean into a plastic soup
8684238 the solution we think is to end the age of disposable plastic
8684239 it feels good man you know to get a second chance and i just have to take advantage of it
8684240 first and foremost i dont want to let myself down definitely my little girl down im thankful for jerry jones the fans in dallas and my teammates for believing in me i need to keep doing what ive been doing to get reinstated staying with myself and my teammates and staying away from those knuckleheads and just stay focused
8684241 it feels good man you know to get a second chance and i just have to take advantage of it
8684242 first and foremost i dont want to let myself down definitely my little girl down im thankful for jerry jones the fans in dallas and my teammates for believing in me i need to keep doing what ive been doing to get reinstated staying with myself and my teammates and staying away from those knuckleheads and just stay focused
8684243 and i thought joe biden did superbly it was the best night by far i thought that bills speech was much more total commitment to obama even than hillarys and i thought that hillarys was a good speech and i believe it will go a long way toward healing the you know competition it wasnt an animosity between hillarys supporters and obamas
8684244 though we did our best to hide it usually by using thicker than normal glasses i think people could easily tell that my left eye and i had been going in different personal and professional directions for some time
8684245 i wish it all the best in its future endeavors
8684246 bloggers who normally provide worthwhile insight into conflict provided curiously generic analysis or links to the same
8684247 were still linking to the same narrow set of news sources sources that offered little more than thin quotes from government officials
8684248 when you have people who have never been to that region whove probably maybe been to moscow once in their life who god knows have never been to georgia or south ossetia or north ossetia never have experienced this and never studied the history of these conflicts and so they reach for the first set of adjectives in the thesaurus thundering tanks and all the rest and the first set of historical analogies that they can possibly reach
8684249 it would be sublimely naive and condescending to expect south ossetians or georgians to respond to intense shellfire by taking a crash course in podcasting even if they did have electricity and and an internet connection
8684250 most were of poor quality and many appeared on blogs with no reputation no previous blogging history some had been registered only a few days before the war and carried no identification of a real person with a real name who could claim responsibility for or ownership of them
8684251 the few blogging accounts i did find enlightening were almost exclusively those written by people i had met on earlier trips to georgia and whom i trusted
8684252 writing in the columbia journalism review julia ioffe finds russian journalists writing on their livejournals offering opinions and perspectives that are far more extreme than what theyd offer on air or in print
8684253 krig42 pledging to stay up all night posting his videos of tskhinvali as
8684254 combine a culture already suspicious of all things political with the natural magnifying outlet of the free for all blogosphere and you get russian bloggers searching desperately for the necessarily elusive key to the riddle of this war
8684255 there are some dope emcees who would perform at the republican convention but not for mccain
8684256 hes not reaching out to us he doesnt have a facebook or a myspace he doesnt twitter
8684257 i understand the ones in the area between weslaco and harlingen not working due to new construction but the others
8684258 the first one was we can go 50 50 on the construction and then later we go 50 50 on the maintenance and operation
8684259 or the other was txdot would come in with 100 percent of the construction we would have built everything to specs left it running and then at that point we turn it over for the cities to maintain
8684260 we do have these agreements with them but as much as we harp on them and they tell us yes yes were going to go check yes yes were going to get a contractor to go do it
8684261 the priorities sometimes change and before you know it that they were going to go look at it next week turns into two weeks or a month and here we calling them again

8684286 as this is now a criminal investigation the council is unable to make any further comments at this stage we have also notified the information commissioner of this incident
8684287 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter

8684293 women more than ever need an advocate in the white house
8684294 i think shell always champion childrens issues and health care because theyve been her issues
8684295 assuming sen obama gets elected she could be somebody to carry water for him in the senate and be a strong voice for health care reform thats really her issue i think thats a great role for her
8684296 i think shes got a long career shes a young woman shes clearly brilliant shes clearly articulate shes in touch with the issues she has a passion for children and families anyone would want to have her involved
8684297 shes just a strong woman and will play even a greater role in the life of our country
8684298 i expect her to be on the vanguard for those issues that were important for us universal health care social and economic fairness those were all issues that brought me into her camp and i know shell continue to promote those
8684299 kerry had a national race and he was just slimed it would have been very difficult for anybody to have immediately bounced back after that this was an intraparty family fight pure and simple shell be back shell be back stronger than ever carrying our values
8684300 i think its very clear that her role in the senate is going to be as one of the strongest women leaders
8684301 but clearly the priority is going to be with the gulf coast and the affected area and politics will take a back seat

8684309 we have been going at top speed up to now
8684310 it is sad we had hoped that more people would be buying our cars
8684311 but improving the quality of our cars is our utmost priority this kind of time can prove important
8684312 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8684313 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8684314 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8684315 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8684316 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8684317 as long as i still get the 83 wins in 133 games sure why not
8684318 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8684319 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
8684320 i think its a case of live and let live i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
8684321 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
8684322 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it
8684323 we pretty much used to eat whatever we were provided with and there were no ingredients on the packet
8684324 with the heating bills it is not too bad in the summer but it is a real worry in the winter months each year the bills go up and things become a little bit tighter to manage
8684325 my husband and i are often conscious about using the heating even when it gets very cold
8684326 we have to think about using the gas fire and the central heating and try to be careful whenever we can
8684327 part of the problem is that you dont know how much the bill is going to be until it arrives and it seems to go up every year
8684328 i cannot tel but but i can say that theyve been working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus

8684336 the modernization and expansion of infrastructure is a constant ongoing market demand in every part of the world and will continue to be a substantial part of our growth
8684337 in britain alone the run up to the london olympics in 2012 is expected to generate more than 10 billion of new construction and infrastructure modernization by virtue of our specialist design capability and expertise in developing tailored access solutions we continue to redouble our expertise in this sector and should be well positioned to capitalize on many of these upcoming opportunities
8684338 this step marks a key milestone in the schedule as the space vehicles progress towards final checkouts in preparation for shipping to the launch site later this year
8684339 we want to make sure everyone understands what the expectations are
8684340 its important that all employees can go to work in an atmosphere free of intimidations and harassment
8684341 it has a lot to do with how they screen applicants and the high expectations they set for staff
8684342 there are quality candidates out there you just have to look from them
8684343 we think its better for not only the educator but the community in general
8684344 the next day i got up and i was feeling sick i had diarrhea and a headache and i got scared
8684345 we didnt know about it the people at the hospital thought it was just a bug
8684346 we have written to maple leaf foods asking them to investigate this particular product more closely we are concerned this is another incident that has not yet been identified
8684347 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8684348 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8684349 the intent appears to be to go after the people who consistently download far more than the typical user without hurting those who may have a really big month infrequently
8684350 as far as i am aware uploads are not affected at least not initially
8684351 hum visiter le cern ca oui mais descendre voir les installations du lhc cest

8684358 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8684359 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8684360 the dems keep saying what an honorable man john mccain has been
8684361 i have no problem with criticisms of obama when presented that way
8684362 he led the team that beat the best political machine in the country in the primaries he is ready to lead this country
8684363 its as big as putting a man on the moon
8684364 we want more afirmative action more federal programs and more handouts
8684365 even if obama wins so called african americans will still be whining and crying
8684366 can anyone really say obama has suffered any where near some of the greatest black americans has he really earned this landmark historical event
8684367 there are so many things that we want to do more than we can do with the resources so when london studio was looking at the early work on eyepet and the prototype of eight days they knew they couldnt do all of them
8684368 pirates vs ninja dodgeball will have scurvy thieves squaring off against crafty martial artists in large detailed arenas
8684369 the music is guitar based rock just the way a rock band should be the album features sounds from the 80s hammond style organs and a bit of rob zombie style as well all the experiences weve had and people weve met touring the world during the last few years have had their influences on the album
8684370 ive had certain putts i had in real life competition break the same way and by the same amount
8684371 what jay z did was brave but it was very clever he rocked that place so it proves he made the right decision
8684372 det tilh rer privatlivet og det udtaler jeg mig ikke om
8684373 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8684374 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8684375 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8684376 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8684377 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8684378 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8684379 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8684380 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8684381 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8684382 the drpa has shown through a series of public meetings and hearings that this action is necessary to keep the bridges and patco trains operating safely and efficiently
8684383 without this funding the drpa would be unable to make vital investments in its infrastructure like re decking the 50 year old walt whitman bridge rebuilding aging patco train cars and completing other important safety and repair projects
8684384 the funds from this toll increase must be used exclusively for transportation infrastructure if the drpa attempts to use those funds for economic development projects on either side of the river i will exercise my authority to veto any such action
8684385 a pesar de los elogios que hemos recibido en la primera temporada hemos hecho un esfuerzo por mejorar lo que cre amos que era mejorable y estamos todos convencidos de que lo hemos conseguido
8684386 mantenemos la misma calidad interpretativa que era la mejor porque as lo han reconocido todos los premios que nos han dado
8684387 desde el primer momento se empez con much sima ilusi n
8684388 los espectadores que nos han seguido nos han permitido hacer esta segunda temporada sin la ayuda de david mart nez y de tve no hubiese sido posible
8684389 the big read reckons that the average adult has only read 6 of the top 100 books theyve printed
8684390 we would like to build a cotai strip in india
8684391 mel has anger management issues but then shes a red head
8684392 i think it will be a competitive tournament and it is a good start to see where we are at this point in the season
8684393 it will be something to build on in the future
8684394 the experience helped a lot being able to sit out that first year instead of jumping into it
8684395 being able to work behind a great goalkeeper like nick noble definitely helped me out it got me to learn the system learn the players and learn what was in front of me
8684396 having a senior defense playing in front of me was a big help they took the brunt of the organization and kind of guided me along and that is what i have to do with this freshmen line i think experience from year one to year two is definitely the big thing that got me through
8684397 the main goal everyone has on this team is to be in dallas in the final four
8684398 we are going to be flying under the radar for most of the year because not many people expect us to do much because we lost such a big senior class
8684399 we definitely have the talent to make it to the final four in december and definitely win the big east we are going to be a good team and can challenge anybody we face so i think this team can accomplish a lot a lot more than people expect
8684400 i think thats something that i expected of myself that i could live up to
8684401 accolades dont really mean much to me per se its more of what the team does its nice to have but most of those things i can attribute to my defense last year
8684402 dirk is a great goalkeeper and the competition is good for us both it pushes us both everyday hes an excellent person to go up against
8684403 dirk and i are friends off the field and when were on the field we definitely try to beat each other in every little thing we do and every little drill its definitely good to have someone like dirk there pushing me everyday i know without him i wouldnt be near where i am today
8684404 ok i want you guys to raise your hands how many of you knew that i was having medical problems
8684405 well thats impossible because its been announced during church and my names in the bulletin and ive asked you guys to pray for it in here and in sunday school also people we dont even talk to have been sending me get well cards so i know its impossible that you didnt know i know that ive been insignificant to you all ever since we started coming here 14 years ago i know i have but when someone tells you their prayer request they expect you to listen and hopefully pray and no offense to any of you but you guys are definitely lacking you dont care about anyone except for the people in your little groups and ive tried to be in your groups too but it just never happened so i gave up but as a church community you guys everyone in the church really is responsible to care about other peoples prayer requests theyre responsible to pray for them
8684406 my best christian friends and the people who support me the most go to public school
8684407 thats exactly what i was talking about we all need to pray for eachother and support eachother and care about eachothers needs
8684408 shes his girlfriend but beyond that i really dont know i am totally in for whatever makes ranbir happy
8684409 it is my dragon or my king kong its just an adornment
8684410 it will be enough if you take care to instruct your children in the fear of god instill them with an orthodox understanding and by teaching them to be faithful you protect them with reasoning that is foreign to the teachings of the orthodox church
8684411 you think it would be better for your son to be with you all the time but who knows with you if god permits he could become spoiled while in the hands of others preserved from harm in the end regardless of where your children might be with you or in the case of someone else instill in them christian principles and entrust them to god and the intercession of the mother of god
8684412 weve never actually even played with one weve played with girls in bands but weve never played with an all girl band
8684413 i dont mind being in a girl band category because it does separate us
8684414 its weird though because i never think of us that way anymore
8684415 people still refer to us like that sometimes but it doesnt happen as often as it used to which is kind of cool i guess but when i hear people say that im always like oh yeah i guess we are all girls i just dont think about that anymore
8684416 were hoping to start getting more attention in dayton which looks so far so good we hope people come out for riverscape and yeah just be on the lookout for the cd
8684417 players disagree with the ministry s assessment of the game
8684418 although large sums of money are often involved poker itself is comparable with other sports though relying on mathematical and psychological skills as opposed to physical
8684419 while there are a few professional players living in the czech republic most see it simply as recreation and a way to escape the monotony of their working lives
8684420 no really youre very good its just that no one cares
8684421 without a falloff the bucs have rebuilt on the fly and continue to do so with 08 first round pick aqib talib who is slated to eventually replace ronde barber in the last two years coordinator monte kiffin and tough as nails secondary coach raheem morris have slotted three new players corner phillip buchanon and safeties tanard jackson and sabby piscitelli into impact roles the safeties attack the corners cover on nickel downs barber moves inside and becomes the games best blitzing corner in 07 the unit allowed a measly 76 2 passer rating expect more of the same for years to come
8684422 hillary told us last night that she is going to do everything that she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8684423 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8684424 people the world have always been impressed by the tpj wow what a line hes so good at boiling the differences between the two parties candidates down into a short concise powerful and memorable sentance statement
8684425 they actually want to us reward them for the last 8 years with 4 more
8684426 my fellow democrats 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity
8684427 i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8684428 we started the process three months ago and so far we have registered about 10 500 palestinian refugees in baghdad
8684429 our teams will soon head to the northern province of nineva and the southern province of basra to register other palestinian refugees another team will visit al walid camp inside iraqi territory on the border with syria
8684430 sign of the brotherhood of the iraqi people and its government
8684431 are still going through an acute humanitarian situation at the border camps
8684432 we highly appreciate the efforts by the iraqi government to offer us all the possible facilities to help us

8684435 the establishment of the global hybrid center at mftbc shows the increasing focus of daimler trucks and mitsubishi fuso on developing hybrid commercial vehicles
8684436 we believe the market for hybrids will expand more rapidly in the future given the need to further reduce vehicle emissions as well as fuel consumption the new center will concentrate our efforts in developing clean efficient hybrid commercial vehicles to meet market needs now and in the future

8684445 this brings to the state of utah a major astronomical initiative to survey distant galaxies survey the early universe to uncover the origin of the first galaxies understand the birth and evolution of our galaxy and discover planets in other solar systems that would have a suitable environment for harboring life
8684446 boosts the reputation of the department and the university and brings internationally important astronomers to utah to collaborate with u scientists and to design future instruments together
8684447 all faculty undergraduate students and graduate students at the university of utah will have access to the data from this survey to pursue research at the forefront of astronomy
8684448 elevating the university of utah to one of the premier physics and astronomy departments
8684449 would love to see more women get into the sciences into physics and astronomy
8684450 joining a recognized astronomy project like sdss iii is a stepping stone to a successful astronomy program at the university of utah
8684451 the wide scope of the sdss iii program from planet searches to galactic studies to cosmology offers ample choices of research topics to faculty and students
8684452 they are going to take light that comes from a star or galaxy pass it into a high resolution spectrograph and look at the specific color lines emitted by specific molecules in the star or galaxy
8684453 use those measured colors to determine the distance to the star or galaxy and the processes occurring within those objects
8684454 mapping the stars of our galactic halo the roughly spherical region with few stars surrounding the populous galactic disk
8684455 measures the abundance of the chemical elements in hundreds of thousands of stars in the milky way
8684456 these precise measurements will reveal how and when the various chemical elements formed in previous generations of stars
8684457 besides the scientific implications this kind of search has repercussions in the way humanity perceives its place in the cosmos
8684458 look up in the sky its a nigga sellin birds on a plane you aint never heard of the pain im the new superhero of the brand new age brand new rims brand new chevrolet
8684459 i do it for my kids and my kids kids and when im dead theyll come to my grave to tell me what they kids did
8684460 how long you think its gonna take before they start to respect the blood and the tears and the sweat and still dont forget where they so called ideas came from and who they call for ideas when they aint none
8684461 e allora cosa c di strano e uno dei soliti bug
8684462 it really has been an amazing blessing and an honor to be able to perform at the dayton reggae fest for 20 years
8684463 ive been fortunate to perform at reggae festivals in many diverse places and what i like to call our little festival right here in the same place where i grew up is still one of the best around its a great multicultural gathering of people of all walks of life and reggae is such positive music that it always lifts the spirits of all in attendance
8684464 ive been a fan and supporter of the dayton reggae festival since its inception
8684465 when seefari asked me to be a part of it i jumped at the chance he and the likes of ras robert have made it the longest running reggae festival in the midwest i see tom carroll as one of the most conscious musicians out there and consider it an honor to work with him
8684466 dayton is spending a lot of time speaking about its creative class
8684467 well heres an example of a group of people that have brought their own brand of fun and the creative spirit to downtown dayton for years now without any catalyst or initiative being in place its festivals like this that make dayton not a dying city as forbes would have it but a living city and we all should support it
8684468 hate for you to miss out on this valuable advice but heres some bonus info now and maybe ill make the recorded version available to you
8684469 message this gets some of them to want your info
8684470 i think it was easier for me to come back to the american league
8684471 it was more difficult last year going into the national league with new parks and new situations but this year im coming back to the al west where i played before and in a park where i played 10 times a year
8684472 well of course they are going to come out with that
8684473 rock and roll will never die but live eternally in paradise
8684474 for those who love to rock an appropriately reserved amount
8684475 on christ the solid rock i stand all other guitar based rhythm games are sinking sand
8684476 if its too loud then youre probably right ill turn it down
8684477 new classics of the fantastic will be an essential science fiction library it will bring back hugo and nebula award winning books that have fallen out of print sadly most award winning genre titles dont last long on the a function of space not quality so idw has assembled a list of extraordinary books titles that represent the very best selections of the very best authors in science fiction robert silverbergs nightwings is a genuine must read for science fiction fans
8684478 sanitation and availability of drinking water are going to be highly restrained therefore there is always the possibility of water borne diseases and some epidemics breaking out unless disease surveillance happens and proper health care facilities are provided especially to the vulnerable groups like children and women
8684479 the biggest concern is clearly that the discharge is expected to increase in the coming months it can double
8684480 therefore the biggest threat comes from the water which is coming from upstream so rains will clearly make things much worse
8684481 so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8684482 on the one hand obama is expected to give one of the best speeches in american history so expectations are enormously high there will be 75 000 people an unprecedented number in attendance cheering him on but because of the attacks on obama as just another celebrity if it looks too much like a rock concert obama could actually be penalized for doing well he could also be penalized if the speech does not meet the skyrocketing expectations for another gettysburg address
8684483 well he probably cannot do what he really would like to do which is make people comfortable about him about his foreign policy experience about the direction of change that he wants to bring and i think that will take time
8684484 what he realistically can do is impress people remind them those who do not know him how articulate he is how sharp is what a great motivator he is and generally get good reviews
8684485 i have been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abysmal failure america cannot afford four more years of this failure
8684486 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8684487 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
8684488 i am really honored that theyve asked me and i cant wait to be a part of their big day
8684489 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8684490 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8684491 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
8684492 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra to selectively inhibit platelet function we now know that not all the enzymes in the cell are doing the same job just like in real estate its all about the location
8684493 the new xyz phone from abc has this and that feature
8684494 do i really need the gps in my advantage do i need gps in a mobile device
8684495 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words
8684496 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8684497 this is consistent with our finding with newborn babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8684498 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8684499 the company pioneered the production of sulphur dioxide leaded petrol cfcs and recently deep well injection of hazardous waste the company then used dubious science political manipulation and cover up to avoid restrictions on their use
8684500 issue a report on pfoa compounds used in dupont products by the 2007 annual meeting at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information evaluating the feasibility of an expeditious phase out of the use of pfoa in the production of all dupont products including materials that may degrade to pfoa in use or in the environment and the development and adoption of safer substitutes
8684501 banning child labor allowing all workers to form and join trade unions and bargain collectively prohibiting discrimination of worker representatives barring discrimination or intimidation in employment and not using forced labor including bonded or prison labor
8684502 are being allowed to create global technology cartels that run below the radar screens of anti trust regulators
8684503 a natural interest both in owning and exploiting plant genetic material mostly derived from developing countries and in replacing farmers own local varieties with few patented crops and their often associated inputs
8684504 this patent may considerably impede the development of maize varieties in latin america
8684505 seriously discourage further research on maize oil content if it is not challenged
8684506 duponts decision to begin toxic discharge into the guadalupe river threatens an already sick bay there is no need for this zero discharge is possible right now all i am asking is that dupont do a feasibility study to find out what it would take to achieve zero wastewater discharge from its victoria plant
8684507 has irrevocably damaged the intelligence of two generations of american children and is responsible for 50 000 deaths a year by heart attack and stroke
8684508 the parallels between duponts handling of cfcs and ethyl are striking both were invented by the same team in the same lab at roughly the same time the dupont company adopted similar strategies to maintain sales of these environmentally hazardous products in both cases dupont answered critics concerns about health and environmental hazards with bold faced denials
8684509 dupont is probably most culpable for stringing out the cfc era for its own business reasons and for delaying a shift to safe alternatives
8684510 put in laypersons terms dupont cheated and it cheated deliberately and with purpose
8684511 benlate did not cause the damages alleged in these cases
8684512 from the time people brush their teeth in the morning using a toothbrush with dupont tynex nylon bristles to the time they go to sleep at night with a pillow filled with dupont qualifol polyester dupont products have become an essential part of daily life

8684749 i dont know how far ahead they planned that we obviously revealed our drum kit much earlier than they did ive a feeling there was a oh s theres cymbals how can we put cymbals on our kit that would be the easiest way without having to rewire everything and re engineer the entire circuit board you can easily run a double bass pedal on our game we have future expandability for high hat control pedals it would also be very easy for us to add other cymbals via the midi interface with the midi jack we can expand it to as many drums and cymbals as humanly possible theres just only so many that the casual consumer can take our high hat control would not just be another way to trigger the high hat it would be a completely separate interface thats mapped differently and that correlates differently in game
8684750 it might just look like more songs but really the technology that were pushing forward and some of the features weve added its not just a title update it really is a new game with a lot of really great stuff we actually have expansion ports on the back of our drum kits that let you attach three cymbals to your drum set at harmonix we really are musicians first and game people second my drum set has three cymbals on it i dont know how many drum sets youve seen with two cymbals on them i guess thats a question for other people

8684754 nici bayern nu ne bate n ghencea crede i c bayern e peste galatasaray steaua va fi o echip greu greu de nvins vom spulbera tot n grupa asta

8684759 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8684760 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8684761 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8684762 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8684763 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8684774 in fact all the charges were municipal court violations that do not carry such penalties
8684775 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer sic witness or arrestee on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
8684776 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
8684777 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
8684778 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8684779 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
8684780 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8684781 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper
8684782 attorneys were at the court from 11 pm on the night of aug 25 2008 and were staying until each and every arrestee came to the city and county building

8684791 my whole thing is that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so expletive smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what expletive dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

8684799 weve got a couple centermen that we think are going to be nhl players
8684800 i think weve got a decent mix of centers defensemen
8684801 when we drafted him we knew that being a big guy he had to get his quickness improved and hes addressed that and hes going to address it this summer
8684802 hes assured us hes going to work very hard this summer
8684803 i compare him to viktor kozlov a big guy that skates well and moves the puck well his maturing level is at 24 25 years old when he gets there he might be at 230 240 pounds
8684804 he probably thinks he needs to get back and get stronger
8684805 hes realizing hes not far off his dream you can tell how badly he wants it his determination is good hes got such good all around hockey skills hes a smart poised player hes not a flashy player but hes in the right place hes got incredible hockey sense
8684806 in the organizations mind hes going to need some seasoning in the american hockey league
8684807 but he made great strides last summer so who knows what hes capable of
8684808 were not going to send him back to junior as an over ager
8684809 he signed last fall he was that impressive in training camp we envision him probably starting the year in wilkes barre and getting some seasoning
8684810 with dustin he needs to work on his quickness and his overall strength
8684811 those two things are whats probably followed him around the last couple years we just saw too much skill and too much hockey sense to overlook his quickness improved and we dont think hes near the peak of what his skating will be the next couple years
8684812 i think casey has to improve his quickness and learn to play at a higher pace be on the move more often he played a couple years in tier ii which was a little slower and he could control the pace hes very good at protecting the puck but he really didnt have to turn his feet over like he would as he climbs to various levels
8684813 casey is behind the curve a little bit as far as the plan that was kind of mapped out for him
8684814 if he has a good summer and impressed in the fall hell be eligible to play in wilkes barre
8684815 i think casey has to improve his quickness and learn to play at a higher pace be on the move more often he played a couple years in tier ii which was a little slower and he could control the pace hes very good at protecting the puck but he really didnt have to turn his feet over like he would as he climbs to various levels
8684816 for him the issue coming out of college minnesota was getting stronger
8684817 i think hes addressed that or hes showing that he can compete for a job at the strength he has right now but after going through a whole season plus playoffs in the american hockey league hes realized he has to get a lot stronger hes an exciting talent pittsburgh really covets him hes a guy thats knocking on the door
8684818 he was drafted with a bit of offense to him but hes projected to be an all around defenseman
8684819 puck decisions getting his feet quicker in the defensive zone thats where were looking for him to improve hes got size hes not piling up the points in college but hes making strides
8684820 its what role does his coaching staff envision for him in the next couple years
8684821 in college a player has to wait until his junior or senior year if he does have those offensive capabilities hes got to wait for his opportunity i envision him having some more development time in college
8684822 what really jumps out with brian is leadership capabilities and determination
8684823 he does a lot of things well not one thing exceptionally well just does a lot of things well everywhere hes gone hes been a quality teammate his leadership and work ethic rubs off on other people
8684824 its just time for him to improve a little bit of everything
8684825 get a little quicker puck decisions but hes a solid defensive defenseman were still wondering if theres a little bit more offense under the surface than hes shown so far
8684826 but when we see the end product he could be a guy playing at 225 or 230 hes got a good work ethic he doesnt get beat one on one he has good puck skills i dont envision him being an offensive defenseman but his passing is above average
8684827 we liked his skating ability his tenacity he moves the puck pretty well
8684828 the issue with him is strength and maybe develop his offensive game
8684829 hes a guy that hoped to have a better season this year
8684830 he had a solid career at notre dame maybe its going to take a bit for him to find his way but we still consider him a prospect
8684831 our evaluations on him have been really really good all year just because of where he comes from and the ambiguity in that situation hes another guy that we thought might fall to us and when it got to the fifth round we said were not letting this guy go any further
8684832 our evaluations on him have been really really good all year
8684833 just because of where he comes from and the ambiguity in that situation hes another guy that we thought might fall to us and when it got to the fifth round we said were not letting this guy go any further
8684834 hes a good athlete and hes quick that along with the size we think this could eventually come together he has a chance of really developing
8684835 disulfiram causes alcohol drinkers to throw up and suffer a hangover as soon as they start to drink

8684837 it improves sensory stimulation and cognitive function when youre a young child we know a lot about some of these things but weve taken a lot of it for granted
8684838 people are focusing on getting kids outside and getting them physical
8684839 but the playgrounds that they have just dont do that anymore if youre used to going from your climate controlled house to your climate controlled car to your climate controlled school and then back to your computer you dont go outside and you dont have to think about creating and manipulating things
8684840 are supplied through regional representatives of playgrounds manufacturers all theyre interested in is selling play equipment
8684841 it almost feels like a zombie at this point its the walking dead its such an abrupt end to what was e3 which had been this huge escalating arms race i understand why they really pulled the plug on the big e3 looking at the amount of money a company like ea would spend on it it was ridiculous amounts of money just to be present and competitive with everyone else so i think they were looking for a way to sign the arms treaty and de escalate the whole thing
8684842 i talked to jane jensen primarily about the story in fact were doing the same thing now because theyre starting work on the second game what i try to put into everything i do is to have something thats driving the story forward and to see that the individual chapters are self sustaining and are as powerful as we can make them i wanted the story to have some dramatic power something to hold you i wanted the little side missions which are a staple of casual games to be a little more organic in some casual games they can get a little sloppy
8684843 james patterson some casual games are sloppy but mine isnt
8684844 i know hes a millionaire and hes got the funds
8684845 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8684846 these findings underscore the link between closer integration of rfid and it infrastructures and maximizing the business value of investments in both areas
8684847 best in class companies are increasing integration of rfid and it infrastructure management by focusing on effective monitoring testing and optimization of their it and rfid infrastructures
8684848 we understand the importance of safety traceability and proper inspection management with all the compliance regulations most notably ansi z35 1 2007 and the ever increasing importance of liability reduction field id is the solution we were looking for by joining the field id safety network our customers are provided with the tools to easily manage safety compliance by using technologies such as rfid mobile devices and the web
8684849 fall protection equipment is highly regulated because of the high profile of risk associated with aerial work there is a huge amount of paperwork that must be created to ensure a harness is safe and compliant with safety regulations the paper trail required becomes quickly unmanageable and often neglected by joining the field id safety network peakworks inc will empower their customers with the tools required to electronically manage their inspections and safety compliance completely paper free
8684850 the industry needs the old e3 back the sizzle is what sells and revealing new information with lasers and booth babes attracts more attention than showing off a game that is going to be released in two weeks

8684868 my focus was going to be to get kids familiar with flagler college when it comes to the softball world flagler is not one of the schools that they softball players research because we didnt have it
8684869 a couple of different things converged together to lead to a pretty substantially large class
8684870 its kind of like a perfect storm several different events all happened at one time so all of the sudden now the enrollment will be over 2 400 its going to be a very large college this fall for flagler standards
8684871 through natural attrition graduation and reducing the size of the january class we should get the enrollment back down to a more manageable number
8684872 its going to be good for us i think itll be a nice experience its something new people will be more interested in the activities and sports and more kids will come out
8684873 for the first time in the colleges history we are having students that are boarding students live at one of the local hotels in saint augustine
8684874 it was an option provided to about 12 male students to live at the howard johnson or to be in triples in lewis which we were trying to avoid the college is not putting any rules and regulations in place no supervision no security however in a gesture on our part the college will be paying the howard johnson so they dont have to pay for housing
8684875 but at the same time theres no ra over there theres no type of security system other than what the hotel has but its the howard johnson i would want some perks if i had to live over there but i also think they are getting a better deal than what everyone thinks they are getting
8684876 flagler is starting to appeal to different people than it used to we are offering more things we have more places to put people and we have this brand new student center
8684877 st augustine is becoming more of a college town were a very small school thats growing beyond its wildest expectations i dont want to see flagler get really big
8684878 the building had a 1982 look and needed a more contemporary look
8684879 dr abare wanted to make it was very inviting and nice for the students faculty and staff that work there
8684880 also the college hired new faculty members and there was a need for additional faculty offices
8684881 the fabbrica is a mixture of library private museum devotional chamber magazine and journal deposit photography and poster fundus fax archive and most recently large mildew spots on the damp walls
8684882 these budget cuts threaten to weaken canadas artistic presence on the international scene
8684883 certain artists benefiting from subventions have been judged to be too radical or too leftist to represent canada abroad
8684884 to understand the concern felt by americans over the weak dollar and the new rich from russia china and saudi arabia one need only take a stroll through the rockefeller center a deeply symbolic building that is also home to christies auction house
8684885 the auction market is flourishing no longer in new york but rather in dubai and hong kong the buyers are the same ones acquiring british football clubs manhattan skyscrapers and villas on the italian costa smeralda
8684886 the revolution in the art market which is worrying america

8684888 we had just let him out for the morning and he ran into the yard and started barking his head off
8684889 but the biology of pancreatic development is very closely related in mice and humans
8684890 i would say within five years we could be ready to start human trials
8684891 this experiment proves you dont have to go all the way back to an embryonic state
8684892 you can use a related cell that may be easier to do and more practical to do
8684893 this adds to the large and growing list of studies helping to make embryonic stem cells irrelevant to medical progress
8684894 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8684895 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8684896 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty

8684906 when i worked with frank and saw his expertise when he became available with the dismantling of ravens staff i started thinking what kind of an advantage we might gain from that given the talent level is on par with most of the teams we played we werent going to line up and beat people walking out tunnel
8684907 i went to one just to see it and wow

8684916 mr perzel has been in office over 30 years i feel somewhere along the way he lost sight of the reason he was there
8684917 the reason is to serve the constituents of the 172nd district not to amass personal power at the end of the 30 years whatever he has accomplished he has accomplished if it hasnt gotten done it wont get done
8684918 it has been a long process and it is a relief to know we are officially an active member of ncaa div ii
8684919 this process not only involved the athletic department staff but the entire college community beginning with the commitment of our president dr william abare
8684920 we commend the u s department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice these decisions illustrate once again that game piracy will not be tolerated and the extent at which these criminals will be prosecuted the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry
8684921 we have already depleted more than 50 percent of the worlds petroleum

8684923 louise pack metcalf an east asheville resident who was one of the plaintiffs could hardly contain her emotion shortly after hearing the news
8684924 i am so thankful i just thank god that they left it as parkland
8684925 im thankful that just one time the system worked for the people and not for the big man
8684926 theres still a lot to be done and there may need to be further hearings to determine exactly what kind of relief is granted

8684929 the butterfly is pretty often interpreted as transformation but the stuff im really interested in is the descent mythology
8684930 and it also relates to the changing of the seasons and our relationship to nature this theme along with wandering or homelessness is why i have small portraits of orphans empty dreamlike buildings
8684931 the cocoon and then the emergence being in this deathlike waiting period
8684932 theres going to be a lot of white with a lot of bright colors
8684933 the whiteness is sort of like creating a space of dreaminess some kind of dream world the wings are all different colors i like to mix of dull tones with these bright colors
8684934 i love doing portraits and after this show ill probably do a stint of that i tend to spend these chunks of time painting real people and then go inward and have the portraits become imaginary people characters in a story i used to do comics and i put out a book from time to time there is storytelling inspiration

8684939 i just told him today youre the love of my life
8684940 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore
8684941 i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me

8684943 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me
8684944 has no idea what is going on in my life samantha has not and would never sell me out

8684948 our biggest markets are located in the western united states and they will provide significant growth for the company in years to come
8684949 given that the majority of our business is in the western united states though it simply made better business sense to move to the heart of our core market
8684950 our top priority since the merger has been to return cash to our business by taking advantage of the synergies the merger has created were beginning to see positive results from those efforts
8684951 as the catechism and early church documents make clear abortion is always an evil that is an unchanging teaching
8684952 the magisterium has not expressly committed itself to an affirmation of a philosophical nature but it constantly affirms the moral condemnation of any kind of procured abortion this teaching has not changed and is unchangeable
8684953 the exact time when a fetus becomes animated has no practical significance as far as the morality of abortion is concerned
8684954 if a person does not know for certain that his action is not killing another human being he must accept the responsibility for doing so anyone who is willing to kill what may be human is by his intention willing to kill what is human consequently the one who performs or consents to abortion inescapably assumes the guilt of voluntary homicide
8684955 on conscience catholic politicians need no reminding that catholic teaching requires them to follow their own consciences
8684956 the erroneous conscience by sheltering the person from the exacting demands of truth saves him thus went the argument

8684963 someone clocked me in the face and took my shoe in the mosh pit this is a quicker route to the pepsi center
8684964 im marching because it seems to be the last vestiges of our free speech and because people have demands and our governments not listening
8684965 we dont want to hurt you we dont want you to hurt us
8684966 i figured as long as we kept things peaceful they would hear us and they did
8684967 just let me live till voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8684968 theyve gone way over the top for years i had no idea where the art donations came from theyre very nice and unassuming
8684969 going to the game its one quiet airplane everyone is focused in on the game plan and their assignments theyre either studying or sleeping but when the games over coming back its like a circus in there the coaches are standing in the back mingling talking
8684970 the linemen get a middle seat in between them because they think theyre big i dont think theyre that big mays is 6 foot 3 and weighs 230 pounds were all jammed in the defensive backs linebackers probably have it the worst the linemen have their space and they think theyre better than everybody else
8684971 we get all the free cheese we can eat being from the midwest thats my favorite thing babybel cheese theyve got the red ones and the yellow one its all about the cheese

8684975 we knew our next job was to be able to communicate how that technology can be used to help our clients grow their businesses
8684976 its really quite astonishing that the bush administration would seek to implement new regulations to the costly tune of 44 million to appease social conservatives during the final months of bushs presidency
8684977 so if the hatred isnt among the democrats then maybe its among those who are reporting this crap
8684978 ive seen war up close i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies who will respect our veterans when they get back home instead of letting them languish without the medical care they deserve
8684979 hillarys values are the values of my family and my community for hillary clinton no american is invisible
8684980 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8684981 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8684982 i was for hillary oh i was for hillary but barack obama beat her and when he won when he beat the woman i backed with all my heart and soul he proved to me that he was ready to be president
8684983 we shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice

8684987 the negative net result for the first half of 2008 the cash dividend payment an the purchase of the groups own shares
8684988 those types of charges that the united states was involved in instigating it you know just are without foundation and just ludicrous plain and simple
8684989 it needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbour
8684990 russia is doing a great job on its own in isolating itself
8684991 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states has specially created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and to benefit one of the candidates in the struggle for the post of president of the united states
8684992 its not only that the us administration could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army
8684993 gunship helicopters targeted a vehicle carrying seven miscreants in koza bandi area of kabal in swat valley all of them died in the action
8684994 fifteen more were killed when security forces hit a militant hideout in the same area numerous people were injured
8684995 suspected islamist militants detonated a remote controlled explosive device when the prison van was crossing a bridge over the kurram river killing six policemen and a passerby
8684996 militants from the tribal areas are now increasingly taking vengeance on security forces
8684997 kiron is not a medical curiosity but was sent from heaven as blessings from the gods
8684998 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8684999 i think what senator obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8685000 can obama force americans to understand the gravity of our problems can he offer solutions
8685001 dragon slayer whose sword has been forged in the intellectual smithy of thinkers

8685014 why are you watching that didnt you know bones is on
8685015 jen its not every day you get to watch this stuff this is history in the making

8685017 its not propoganda these are real people this could be our president and vice president
8685018 why you probably definitely should not vote for me as president

8685022 i dont know what is happening at everton actually there might be a slight problem between david moyes and his president regarding the signing and im also aware of the fact that newcastle want him as well
8685023 it is slow in terms of getting anything done because were trying to get decent players off other teams
8685024 i expect a flurry over the weekend though and hopefully were involved in it
8685025 hopefully we can get one or two players into the squad and there may be one or two players that move on as well as a consequence of that
8685026 it wont be difficult to pick the players up because it happens to quite a few teams
8685027 its inappropriate to comment on what is going on behind the scenes at the moment
8685028 were working on it but ive been doing transfers for many many years and know nothing is done until its done either in or out
8685029 well see what happens but unfortunately everybody is going to have to wait
8685030 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8685031 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8685032 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8685033 after an hours play i thought we upped our energy levels and our play was more progressive
8685034 from that point onwards through extra time there was only one team that looked like they were going to nick it
8685035 we had a couple of chances michael johnson could very well have won it before the end of play
8685036 but well take the result it doesnt matter how we go through
8685037 its a bit of a lottery with penalties but were delighted weve overcome this hurdle
8685038 youre always relieved there are no easy games its a cliche but in europe there arent look at the events of last night with liverpool
8685039 it is a big blow to us and we could be without him kranjcar until around christmas or whatever
8685040 the frustrating thing is he didnt even do the injury playing for us he played nearly all the games last season and hes a player you cant replace really but we are going to try
8685041 jermain has picked up a bug and we just hope he will get over it in time
8685042 as for jerome hes never had a back problem before and we dont know why hes got one now maybe its because of a change of beds since he moved here
8685043 there are still a lot of ways we can play
8685044 although 4 4 2 is the way ive chose to go with these two up front there are going to be some games in which we go back to 4 5 1 which was so successful last season
8685045 ive still got a good squad even though it is not big enough especially with the uefa cup coming up

8685052 the androgen receptor in the stromal cells always turns the cancer on
8685053 the androgen receptor in the epithelial cells at least in the animal models we studied tends to inhibit cancer
8685054 anyone who has been around teen boys and older men knows that androgen receptors in different parts of the body cause different effects
8685055 androgen receptors on the scalp make older men lose their hair while androgen receptors on the face make teenagers grow beards so androgen receptors can do different things in different places

8685068 bechara must be remodeled in tune with the new puerto rico i have been here since 1982 and have dedicated all my efforts to work with the local government to improve the area because we cannot expect the government to do it all
8685069 we have already acquired an entire block on georgetti street except one parcel at a 5 million investment this was a dilapidated area plagued with prostitution we are going to demolish the structures and make the space available to investors and developers so they can build projects that promote housing retail stores and light commercial spaces for the next generation of doctors lawyers accountants engineers dentists and more
8685070 we want to get the permits and financing lined up getting the financing isnt easy but there might be developers who can finance their own projects we want financing that is accessible
8685071 san francisco has its biobay and singapore its biopolis now puerto rico will be known as bioisland
8685072 this project has actually sparked the flame and created a domino effect in the area enticing entrepreneur to ito mu oz along with a group of investors to redevelop all the area of the former corona beer facility under the citys master development plan
8685073 now pavia hospital santurce has noticed what doctors hospital is doing and wants to do the same it just shows you the domino effect redevelopment has in surrounding areas

8685075 the board of directors of the tourism development fund tdf and the government development bank gdb approved late last week the direct financing of a 120 million construction loan for the 150 room bah a beach st regis five star hotel in r o grande
8685076 the gdb has the responsibility and the financial capacity to assume its fiscal agent role when the private sector is limited by present economic conditions we will take this role without necessarily competing with the private sector banks the st regis represents an important development in the tourism industry so we must ensure its viability through the tdf as soon as the private banks are in a position to support the project they will do so
8685077 firstbank had preapproved the construction loan but with a gdb full guarantee apparently the gdb decided to provide the financing directly instead of the requested guarantee as a matter of public policy
8685078 i cant deny that the paseo caribe situation has had and is having an impact regarding the perception of financial institutions developers and investors
8685079 antonio mu ozs mu oz holdings and federico s nchezs interlink group are excellent clients with excellent credit we believe in the project and understand the importance it has for puerto rico but we have a fiduciary responsibility to the regulators the credit rating agencies and our shareholders
8685080 beauchamp is not going to let the same dog bite him three times the first time was the marriott courtyard the second paseo caribe and he is not going to let the same dog bite him a third time it would show very poor business judgment and he is a veteran banker with plenty of it the government allowed this situation to happen so now it has to face the consequences this applies not just to firstbank but any other bank willing to finance substantial tourism projects in puerto rico
8685081 in puerto rico there are only three banks left in that segment financing of major tourism projects of the industry firstbank scotiabank and popular
8685082 of course there is an element of discussion among the gdb board of directors but i can only speak as a member of the board of the tourism development fund tdf and the hotel development corp hdc our priority has been and still is to participate in conjunction with private sector banks
8685083 for years tdf and gdb policy has been to not be a direct lender letting private sector banks provide the financing and that continues to be the priority but if private sector banks cant or dont want to assume the risk and demand certain conditions that for them are not negotiable then we have to rethink our function and assume a more active role in the financing of essential tourism development projects such as the five star st regis mandarin and regent
8685084 these projects are so important that even before the discussions with the gdb the hdc had approved investing in the projects as partners we also share the concerns of paseo caribe as hdc has been part of the project
8685085 we have been working hard and the restoration is 75 completed
8685086 the work has been hard because after four years of complete abandonment it has taken us more time than expected to redo the property the site was infested and we had to clean it thoroughly it was also covered by mildew and mold not to mention that we refurbished the 18 hole golf course with the hike in construction costs and the exorbitant operational costs we face our only possibility of success is to make cayo largo an upscale hotel
8685087 thats why were being extra careful with our cayo largo project we need a brand that can embrace all the components of a high end product and we are even considering running it independently as one of the possible scenarios that is yet to be decided and because of it we are in no hurry
8685088 we already reopened three venues under our different flags el portal quality inn a 47 room hotel at condado a 99 room el tuque quality inn in ponce and le consultat on magdalena avenue in condado a 20 room boutique hotel from our clarion collection
8685089 the centro m dico project will have several meeting rooms because right now there are no meeting or group facilities there it will serve the medical community as well as the public in general we havent decided under which flag it will operate because the lease is still being negotiated we still dont know how much the investment for remodeling will be but i guess it wont be cheap when in operation it will employ 10 15 nor do we know yet the brand for the isla verde hotel and surrounding condos which is also in negotiations but it certainly will expand our visibility in puerto rico in a big way i can only say that right now it operates privately under no flag
8685090 for a 100 room hotel 25 employees will be enough but then with a casino depending on its size it will need several more employees
8685091 in march they will begin the demolition of the existing structure the former cardol discount store and in 18 months will have a four story hotel completed
8685092 were not the kind of people who say lets go to a place where there are a thousand other people from new york at the hotel
8685093 indeed this project is emblematic of our firm belief and commitment to invest in puerto rico we cant let cyclical economic changes or difficult economic times cloud our vision of a better puerto rico for future generations plaza internacional is a key component of the ciudad mayor initiative as such we will contribute with the development of a state of the art integrated facility that not only improves the quality of life in the area but also contributes by attracting new investment and creating much needed jobs
8685094 it will be a four star hotel focused on 24 hour service and a diverse offering of restaurants and entertainment options for hotel guests and comfortable rooms averaging 380 square feet to 420 square feet its ideal location only minutes away from the airport and closely located to the metro areas business district will enable the future crowne plaza to attract conventions and special events to its 20 000 square feet of meeting space including a large 11 000 square foot banquet ballroom facility
8685095 my aim in this book was for the reader to learn about puerto rico
8685096 i wanted whoever had been to this island to be able to pick up this book and recognize the culture instantly
8685097 were eliminating 95 of the comic readership by doing this but i didnt give a s
8685098 that this is where ben grimm comes for vacation because he looks like the fort if you remotely resemble anything on this island youre automatically a cult hero
8685099 we were like three school girls at a slumber party
8685100 it was this cool little p r thing we were talking about
8685101 short cultural history of p r for gringos and others
8685102 in this book we really hit on the culture i think puerto rico is probably the fifth member of the fantastic four in this piece
8685103 right now we are evaluating who will be operating those two hotels the dorado beach and cerromar we will also begin evaluating the architectural part and the main issue here will be whether its more feasible to remodel cerromar how to do the rebuilding and the extent of the demolition if it comes to that there are several main issues here to consider
8685104 all this is under evaluation we expect to have some decisions made by january in order for us to proceed
8685105 we first have to go through a design and permitting process which will probably take us all of 2008 and we will hopefully begin construction full blast by the first few months of 2009 we hope to have all the planning structured by the first quarter of next year
8685106 to be a worlds best destination you have to go large scale and thats why were being so cautious in the way we disclose information about this project
8685107 were forming sve studios p r because with a wholly owned puerto rican company we can better capitalize on the many incentives provided to film producers by the puerto rican government puerto ricos diverse topography will also allow us to produce virtually any kind of movie from a wild west ghost story to a pirates movie on the high seas puerto rico has it all working with puerto ricos already strong film production community sve studios p r s business mission is to develop the infrastructure necessary to take a film from pre production through principal photography and then wrap post production on the island this will allow us to circumvent the high cost of working with the studios and unions in hollywood and bring in additional revenue by being a one stop shop for other production companies coming to puerto rico we expect this to be the beginning of a permanent stereo vision presence in puerto rico
8685108 not to stand in the way of the work the team had already begun
8685109 were not belittling the difficulty of the times were going through theres no denying that but we have also made progress in some areas sometimes amid extremely difficult circumstances despite it all puerto rico still has many great assets and competitive advantages over other regional competitors and all of us have the responsibility of continuing to move forward for puerto ricos sake
8685110 despite all of this we were able to move forward several high impact projects four of them in the mayag ez region lockheed martin honeywell aerospace wsifb and essig research abbotts 450 million expansion in barceloneta in a former pfizer building and the expansion of recoms a local bioscience company dedicated to process validation
8685111 chief among the 2008 projects already confirmed is angiotech in aguadilla a medical devices company that will hire 559 people many of them laid off by hewlett packard theyre investing 13 million to retool a pridco building for their expansion others include coopervision in juana d az with 100 employees and a 170 million investment lockheed martin and the bioprocess plant both in mayag ez with a combined 63 million investment and microsofts 52 million digital distribution initiative
8685112 there has been a fundamental change in the way companies are supplying their products globally there has been a shift toward regional coverage from that of traditionally supplying just one jurisdiction companies are taking a regional strategy by supplying full regions as opposed to one individual country and that can change the manufacturing supply chain by shifting production to certain jurisdictions which can better supply a region
8685113 as a result we have seen a significant reduction in the number of new drug approvals in 2005 i believe the fda approved 30 new drugs in 2006 it was 31 new approvals but so far this year only 10 new approvals have been granted combine this with numerous patent expirations which far outweigh the number of new drugs in each companys pipeline and you can clearly see how this imbalance will affect manufacturing plants
8685114 many people measure the success of pridcos efforts solely on the basis of new openings but given the transitional nature of traditional manufacturing around the world retention of existing companies is just as important for every honeywell that begins operations there are many like lifescan already operating here that we have to fight hard to keep from leaving for ireland or other emerging markets we were able to do a lot in 2007 despite difficult times and a nearly expired industrial incentives act
8685115 theyre going through a very comprehensive restructuring process but their commitment to puerto rico remains firm
8685116 our task ahead will be more of a balancing act maintaining what we have while rapidly establishing the kind of infrastructure that will enable us to insert puerto rico in the knowledge economy as a leading competitor our world class high skilled and bilingual labor force coupled with decades of leadership in the manufacturing industry will serve as the launching pad of our biotech and life science industry
8685117 with one million square feet of new laboratory space in addition to various existing lab facilities around the island and the 30 000 square feet of lab space in the new mayag ez facility we will jump right to the major leagues of the biotech and life sciences industry up until now we didnt have the kind of capital needed to effectively compete on a global scale the land transfer capitalizes the trust for future construction which in turn guarantees an ongoing source of income to support our quest to become bioisland
8685118 large municipalities received matching funds a dollar for each dollar they invested whereas smaller municipalities got their initiative under way in partnership with manufacturing companies and trade organizations who donate in kind services staff and equipment
8685119 we are looking at various solutions to identify funds for more researchers meanwhile as part of the legislative effort to approve a new economic incentives law were also recommending relevant tax exemptions credits recruitment subsidies and other incentives not only to attract but to retain the worlds top scientists
8685120 with 4 581 new rooms already under way were 93 closer to our 5 000 new room goal and well have the rest secured before year end
8685121 last year was a tough year but we managed to make progress in each of our strategic areas hotel development air access marketing product development and customer service were on track with our first bond issue which will help us capitalize the hotel development corp and participate as facilitators in the development of top projects as we increase our room inventory weve attracted renowned hotel flags including our first three five star hotels compared to none just four years ago
8685122 after last years tourism investment forum we received many calls from local property or land owners expressing their interest in selling their real estate through our catalog each property will be evaluated on its merit to make sure it fits with the development strategy for that particular region
8685123 the fastest growing numbers in hotel occupancy in puerto rico are coming from this region in 2005 2006 the area registered a 4 4 increase in hotel occupancy and last year 2007 averaged 69 3 even higher than the islands 68 4 average
8685124 one of the most challenging aspects of expanding our air access has been the decentralization of airport arrivals meaning creating opportunities for more and more passengers to fly into aguadilla or ponce instead of luis mu oz mar n international airport in isla verde the 4 million fund created for this purpose has helped us secure 29 new flights to regional airports with an economic impact of 120 million to complement the tourism development initiatives in porta del sol and porta caribe but theres still more work to do in this area clearly hotel development within those regions must also continue to meet passenger projected demand
8685125 again our difficult economic situation coupled with signs of trouble with the stateside economy has forced us to be more aggressive in marketing this has also opened up opportunities to diversify our tourism product as we saw with the puerto rico open the salsa congress saborea gourmet festival the culebra heineken international regatta and many other opportunities despite difficult times porta del sol registered an 8 5 increase in nonresident registrations and porta caribe 5 which points to the need of increasing room inventory in those regions as well
8685126 indeed the economic situation has slowed down slot machine and casino revenue in general but it will not impact the bond issue we will proceed as planned
8685127 in addition to the recession which has impacted the industry as a whole well continue to partner with the treasury department to fight illegal video games which is truly putting a dent in casino profits
8685128 efforts are very advanced and many of the strategies included in the branding platform have been outlined i do believe we will see a unified branding initiative for puerto rico soon with the support of various industry sectors i think it will work precisely because of the involvement of the private sector from day one however consensus on this subject is crucial to make sure all puerto ricans understand what the brand is all about rally around it and most importantly feel empowered to promote the brand accordingly
8685129 we continue with our ongoing maintenance and repairs program top security and new feasibility studies to develop the centers second phase for additional capacity
8685130 which well accommodate with outdoor tents also our coordination of citywide conventions has gotten very effective with shuttle services to and from the convention center and hotels in the entire san juan metro area
8685131 as room inventory within the district increases we will also be able to increase our service capacity
8685132 were also evaluating construction of the second hotel in the area a marriott courtyard even the sheraton is considering an additional 250 rooms once it inaugurates its first phase bringing the areas total room inventory to 1 000
8685133 every year the quality of events goes up making it a very exciting venue for all puerto rican and foreign promoters this year well see a great disney on ice show thats second to none and anything with the disney franchise name represents an important vote of confidence in our venue
8685134 the most important aspect of this program is what we call capturing where we help entrepreneurs prepare to become successful business owners from the 30 hour business plan course to the advanced course where the person validates his or her business plan after completing a 12 hour business administration course
8685135 while 2007 was a difficult year for many sectors puerto ricos small and midsize businesses effectively competed helping the economy move forward under our flagship program we secured more than 800 new businesses for puerto rico that represent an investment of 36 million and more than 9 000 new jobs
8685136 at our cetpymes the fast track permit processing centers for small businesses we try to eliminate the guessing and complications often associated with the permit process at cetpymes the business can process its valid permits from the regulations amp permits administration arpe the health department and the trade co in 20 days down from 120 prior to the new fast track permit system since the program began last september we have reviewed more than 13 000 cases approved 11 998 plus another 1 000 subject to some conditions
8685137 through the single certification process all of the participating agencies can view the profile of the company and facilitate communication and payment processes when doing business with the government
8685138 the combined results of these trade missions have a projected sales potential of 32 million among the 251 companies that participated
8685139 as we make our operations more efficient by leveraging the international offices currently in the dominican republic costa rica panama chile and spain facilitating access to more local companies in the free trade zone program directing our international trade missions to potential markets and helping new exporters through puerto rico exporta the greater our return on investment is from trade and export activities
8685140 the strike certainly slowed down our production but we are back on track with 32 projects in the pipeline including short films another challenge we face is insurance given our tropical weather and somewhat limited filming period and because of our hurricane season productions tend to line up their projects during the first half of the year so we are working on other programs like the one to develop new screenwriters or special collaborations like the popular chilean novela soap opera that is being shot on the island in the area of dorado with both puerto rican and chilean actors
8685141 the land administration has the unique opportunity to participate in a myriad of diverse development projects last year our efforts contributed to advancing the development of the san juan waterfront primarily by making possible two such key projects as harbor plaza adjacent to the ochoa building with a 130 million investment and capitolio plaza also in the area which has finished its first tower with a 50 million investment and is set to start the second tower for an additional 90 million
8685142 our current development pipeline includes seven major projects with a combined investment of 450 million over the next two years and from the tourism end were working with the prtc on the development of the tourism real estate catalog which includes the development of such projects as la pared de luquillo and luc a estate in yabucoa in many instances we secure all the permits for the proposed development and turn them over to the developers so they are ready to start construction
8685143 first we had to determine which specific properties were available after that determination dtop had to establish the property location size title liens if any on the property any drawings available in their files description of structures if any on the property past and present use and other relevant information necessary for the sale
8685144 after puerto ricos double victory in the caribbean classic we have become its official and permanent home that makes us very proud but also opens up a myriad of development and training opportunities for our local breeders as well as potential jockeys
8685145 weve seen a strong start to 2008 on the betting side and after six years we have secured funding and resources to operate la esmeralda equine park in the south region of the island
8685146 the big problem in the 1940s and 50s was that we had too many people
8685147 the island was overpopulated and now ironically it may be the reverse to the extent puerto ricans migrate to the mainland u s where the economy may have better prospects it will actually make the situation worse
8685148 when birthrates and populations decline and the dependent population mainly seniors outpace workers an economy usually enters a long period of stagnation and reduced living standards
8685149 thats the risk now faced by puerto rico within the next 20 years
8685150 developed countries at least got a chance to grow rich before they grew old today most developing countries are growing old before they get rich
8685151 on the consumer side the steep rise in 65 will depress consumer demand as seniors either will not have the disposable income to spend much or will not have the need to spend even if they have the income or savings
8685152 this whole trend will drag down median purchasing power and therefore overall sales on the island put a significant strain on government coffers higher social spending and a smaller tax base and otherwise hurt prospects for economic growth and prosperity
8685153 the sales and growth crisis will spread to other product categories and the economy as a whole
8685154 will probably increase the labor participation rate or the proportion of people between 16 and 65 who are in the work force since younger people generally have lower participation rates
8685155 from a labor standpoint companies that dont prepare now for this situation that is coming will not last in the market
8685156 given the dwindling number of people who will be available in the local talent pool those who are available may not necessarily have the required skill sets required by companies
8685157 the majority of students are women which means that 15 to 20 years from now there will be more women than men in the labor force
8685158 because more women will be working they will have fewer children as happens with most women who work today this will further contribute to declines in population and ultimately in the labor pool
8685159 puerto rico is not ready for this type of change
8685160 i dont see the government taking any steps to prepare for this which will negatively affect us if no action is taken the one thing in our favor now is that were still on time to prepare
8685161 the government will have to reorient its focus toward the growing elderly population
8685162 for example primary education costs will have to be reduced from now until 2025 and government priorities will have to be refocused to address the needs of the aging population such as health issues
8685163 the elderly population have all sorts of needs and therefore it creates markets that at this time may not exist
8685164 for example housing for the elderly becomes an interesting market as well as services to care for the elderly things like cruise ships which is an attractive vacation option traditionally popular among older individuals
8685165 so you have a bigger market for this sort of entertainment the population shift presents lots of challenges but also lots of opportunities
8685166 we need to work on keeping our doctors on the island and on training our medical staff in geriatrics in order to keep pace with the demand
8685167 in puerto rico we have a problem with long term planning and this is one of those issues where everybody sees that problems are brewing ahead but they say it is too far away
8685168 if nothing is done it could mean a severe economic slowdown we will have a big portion of the population without the means to support itself and an economy that will not be able to grow because there will not be enough labor to support growth this demographic alert should be on top of the priority list
8685169 we are doing a pre opening ceremony to thank all the people involved in the project from carpenters to engineers and their families it is a very special occasion because it marks the beginning of our paseo gastron mico de san germ n or san germ n gastronomic route a concept that includes three more restaurants around the town square that will be developed and managed by interpec next on the list is o dougalls authentic irish pub a concept we also developed on the mainland that should be ready by next summer because it doesnt need construction and all the equipment has been ordered it will employ 18 people
8685170 for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of america my sons and i came up with a theme that fuses spanish mexican and american cuisine this will be the biggest of all our restaurants with two levels and 235 seats and approximately 50 employees and last but not least will be pink lobster a seafood restaurant that will seat 175 people and employ 35 people
8685171 because our prices will be the same in puerto rico and the mainland our meats will be top choice always fresh not frozen and our lobsters will be from maine although we are going to be profitable we will always be thinking of delivering the best quality at the lowest price to our customers there is no way people wont want to come to san germ n the best food at the best price and the scenery alone is worth the trip
8685172 the fast track permit process worked well they followed up with pending documents and helped move projects from one reviewing agency to the next expediting the overall process we hope the new permits system scheduled to be in place within a month or so follows some of the same processing principles of the task force
8685173 these projects are extremely important for puerto rico because they help keep the economy moving forward with much needed construction jobs new permanent jobs and retail sales what i like the most about these developments is that theyre small to mid size commercial centers located throughout the island in areas where the local community truly needs those services
8685174 prior to 2006 the local office market was very stable with vacancy rates in the range of 8 to 10 since 2006 however the prime office real estate market has been increasing its vacancy rate to a level of 14 and up to 16 in some cases
8685175 in order to compete many landlords remodeled while having to keep the same rents or in some cases reducing these in reaction to the local market situation
8685176 the construction costs are higher and since demand is slowing the vacancy ratio will certainly grow even more
8685177 banks are more careful in the analysis of their clients capacity to repay loans and this will further restrict the financing alternative for user buyers on the other hand the decrease in interest rates and stable market values make the current commercial real estate market a buyers market
8685178 this would double the number of existing class a and b buildings commercial banks indirectly control construction by approving loans to developers that have leased at least 50 or more of a building but how do we control the space that is left behind the natural balance in the real estate market forecasts that prices will inevitably go down
8685179 sometimes that serves as an excuse to put a young man in jail when he needs a different kind of treatment
8685180 in puerto rico thats an issue that nobody wants to touch
8685181 its a proposal that we should be open to discussing
8685182 its very simple dvd piracy is stealing and therefore a crime every time an individual buys a duplicate dvd copy he or she becomes an accomplice in that criminal enterprise
8685183 this illegal activity which will be prosecuted is wiping out years of hard work to position puerto rico as a top film market
8685184 independent film making is a tough and competitive business as it is mostly due to limited financing options
8685185 puerto rico releases have been simultaneous with those on the mainland u s however it could take weeks or even months to reach some latin american markets by the time releases get there our puerto ricos black market distributors would have sold thousands of copies in advance killing chances of box office success in those markets
8685186 the local black market has gotten so big that it is having an impact on stateside revenues film studios find themselves fighting illegal online sales and movie file sharing even before films hit stateside theaters
8685187 so far my distribution hasnt been affected but as soon as sonys legal department deems it appropriate to hold back a release to protect its investment it can do just that
8685188 if a blockbuster film is distributed before release time our chances to recoup our investment are greatly reduced
8685189 this has an impact on movie theaters since they depend on moviegoers and concession sales to maintain operations the video division also feels the impact since black market copies reduce movie rentals and even dvd sales
8685190 remains vigilant inside our theaters and will report any suspicious activity in the end moviegoers are the ones inconvenienced
8685191 we organized the conference around the many areas of interest to investors in which puerto rico offers unique opportunities
8685192 the response so far has been very positive we are getting a lot of interest from investors in the u s and puerto rico
8685193 our mission is to showcase puerto ricos business sector and its many possibilities as we strengthen it with this type of event
8685194 puerto ricos food industry track record during the past two years is best described as impressive and somewhat unprecedented with some 125 to 150 new food establishments opened during that period of time i do not know of any other industry sector within our local economy that continues to grow at the rate of the local food industry
8685195 our food industry is a great example and a solid business case study of what entrepreneurs can do when market conditions get tough we got creative sought greater efficiency increased product diversity secured better technology applications to facilitate operations and delivered better service most importantly we faced the competition head on instead of retreating ourselves instead of being afraid of the proverbial big bad wolf as so many describe the megastores
8685196 instead the majority of our food retailers wholesalers and food distributors chose to put up a good and fair battle and today theyre not only growing but giving some of these large companies a good run for their money
8685197 the story of our supermarket industry is that of one that has grown thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of our people folks who recognize that theres only one constant in our business and that constant is change those who have their ears to the ground who are hands on in their business and keep abreast of the latest trends both locally and worldwide can anticipate local changes and decide whether to adapt or not
8685198 many of those who in the early 1990s refused to change are no longer around to tell their story fortunately the majority of our local key players recognized the arrival of the multinationals well in advance and thanks to their entrepreneurial spirit and preparedness they have made our food industry stronger than ever i bet the multinationals never thought our local entrepreneurs would be as smart and resilient as they are
8685199 the fact that we continue to grow is not only a good indication that even when things get tough if we organize ourselves we can thrive and succeed most importantly i think puerto ricos food industry leads by example in what it means to bet on puerto rico to keep reinvesting in the local economy and not stand by waiting for what can or should be given to us but rather going after what we want in the end by strengthening our food industry were making puerto ricos economy more financially solid and we are laying fertile ground for other industries to do the same
8685200 puerto ricos food industry is a dynamic changing and proactive industry most importantly it is a customer driven industry where the voice of the consumer is very much a part of the way we do business todays consumers are more sophisticated and knowledgeable about products nutritional values and other industry trends consumers have also become more demanding regarding price convenience store appeal and security given the hectic lives most puerto ricans live they also prefer to meet their food needs with as few visits to the store as possible and get what they need all in one place
8685201 if i had to do it all over again id do it exactly the same way
8685202 i have the utmost respect for our local food industry its a tough business but it keeps puerto rico healthy and the economy moving forward im honored to be a part of it
8685203 as a matter of fact one of my first calls after acquiring pueblo was to mr toppel whom i consider a mentor he was moved by the gesture and of course willing to help in any way he could
8685204 meanwhile we continue to invest to bring the stores to optimum conditions next in line is the reconstruction of 94 000 lineal feet of refrigerators and well continue to deliver the best service the food industry has something amazing happens when you can hire back so many employees who had lost their jobs they come back with greater appreciation for what it means to come to work every day i have no doubt i have the most motivated workforce on the island
8685205 whatever you do in life do it with passion thats the secret whether its mopping the floor or running a multimillion dollar corporation
8685206 our strength comes from our union its as simple as that
8685207 we are the most diverse group of entrepreneurs working together in puerto rico each one of us is an owner operator thats why we pour our hearts and energy into our stores to make sure we stay in touch with the clients needs at all times collectively were a force to be reckoned with
8685208 i see no limits to what econo can do as i said earlier our strength comes from our union and the cohesiveness we find as we come together as a family a family of 32 individual owners members things can happen and if one of our stores faces difficulties and has to close that is unfortunate but we will continue to work together to avoid that from ever happening you can throw one of us out but you cant throw all of us out so econo is going to be around for a long time
8685209 yes the acquisition of pueblo could have facilitated some of the plans we have especially to grow our distribution to keep pace with the stores growth but by no means will we stop growing were already working on expansion plans for our distribution center and more stores
8685210 for a moment think about the strength and soundness our industry has at the time of pueblos bidding process not one or two or even three but rather four local companies were in a position to successfully acquire the pueblo stores thats fantastic and true testimony that puerto ricos food industry is one of the most solid industries in our local economy to date
8685211 as an industry we couldnt have let the closing of pueblo go without doing something about it as a sector we are stronger and better because pueblo can continue to operate
8685212 the fact of the matter is that the expansion of supermarket chains stateside and local alike has brought a greater level of convenience to even some of the most remote areas around the island that many years ago relied on the colmaditos for their main grocery shopping nowadays not only roads are better and cars more prevalent but supermarkets are more accessible and convenient for consumers
8685213 that is not to say however that competition from larger formats like megastores and food clubs hasnt contributed to the segments market share decline but it has not been the only factor
8685214 what we have noticed however is that small businesses have not switched entirely to purchasing their weekly provisions from the traditional wholesalers they are visiting both the grocery wholesaler and the food club
8685215 iris observations indicate many of the small businesses will purchase beverages and paper products at the food club when on sale for example yet buy the bulk of their other provisions from the traditional grocery wholesaler
8685216 i am not afraid of anyone as a matter of fact whenever possible id like to open a ralphs wherever the megastores have one of theirs initially i was seriously criticized when i decided to jump into this industry segment at a time when many key players were leaving i realized that even before megastores arrived puerto rico still had underserved areas i decided to prepare for their arrival adapt to new market conditions and compete and compete we have
8685217 i figured we needed spacious and modern locations to serve customers the way they deserved i decided to establish the warehouse operation adjacent to the retail supermarket and serve both types of customers at the same time that way i leverage the investment and logistics of the warehouse and could supply my retail stores from my own warehouse immediately without delays and at convenient prices
8685218 i still see tremendous growth opportunities i have yet to go to guaynabo bayam n and on to r o grande can vanas and lo za
8685219 the key to success is to work every day remain involved in every aspect of the business educate yourself about the latest industry trends and maintain the greatest variety competitive prices and best service
8685220 the industry has been transforming over the past 10 to 15 years as key players adapt they have chosen different ways to compete from a revised version of the traditional cash amp carry to new hybrid concepts or others who have completely migrated toward the retail end of the industry we have stayed with the traditional cash amp carry format but carrying packaging options that some of the larger food clubs cant or dont do has given us an important competitive edge some of the large food clubs like sams club owned by wal mart operate a food club but also serve individual customers we only want to serve small business owners and make sure we give them the tools to continue growing their businesses
8685221 we have also been very successful with our el criollazo marketing program through it clients are feature in our shopper and can also advertise their store locations we also place banners and develop other point of sale materials for them
8685222 the best example of how we better serve our customers through el criollazo is the volume discounts we can pass on to our customers so that a local drugstore like farmacia ruiz belvis can sell a two liter coca cola bottle for seventy nine cents like the large supermarket chains
8685223 most importantly as long as they remain competitive in their service and the type of packaging options they can offer theyll always have a solid market to serve they need to continue increasing their variety and diversifying their service by expanding delivery operation hours and even offering credit options to facilitate payment all of these measures will go a long way to serve the islands small businesses and colmaditos which are vital in the food sales chain for thousands of families
8685224 were truly excited about the construction of this integrated facility this not only represents an important investment in the future of our company but a vote of confidence about the future of our industry and puerto rico
8685225 we have excellent competitors and that helps us all keep the industry growing and moving forward
8685226 when wal mart decided to come to puerto rico it was because it saw an opportunity to bring its everyday low prices philosophy to the local retail market that successful formula was extended to the food industry segment and we have been extremely successful there too
8685227 but what were most proud of is our record of excellence in all aspects of the operations which not only affords us the opportunity to deliver everyday low prices but provide the best service to our customers by doing so we have elevated the industrys standards and competitive level only resulting in a stronger industry and with greater advantages for consumers
8685228 this is one of the programs that were particular proud of our suppliers partners program whereby we can sell excellent quality merchandise from local manufacturers and distributors which allows us to reinvest in the local economy and help local businesses grow
8685229 in fact some of our suppliers have not only placed their products through our local operations but companies such as arroz rico carlas sweets and a whole series of fresh produce products are now introduced and sold through our wal mart stores in other markets
8685230 delivers traditional mexican dishes with a twist more like tex mex combined with an american influence typically found at border locations between mexico and the u s
8685231 the whole corillo staff from ir just got back from dallas where we had a chance to taste the entire menu and go through the on the border experience im convinced puerto rico not only will like the concept but will enjoy the blend of good food affordable dining and an entertaining ambiance
8685232 our original plan with chilis was to open five locations in five years we ended up with eight within that time and are now up to 15
8685233 we will include a hydrogen station that residents and guests can use for their hydrogen propelled vehicles
8685234 we have already initiated talks with some manufacturers that have prototypes for this type of car like bmw mercedes benz toyota honda and volkswagen
8685235 divided in two sectors the first is about 46 acres and is on the west side of the property along the esp ritu santo river the second area is about 44 acres and is also on the west side of the property next to the service parcel to secure the protection of this land our family created a title deed called a perpetuity natural reserve
8685236 we not only view our property as a beautiful place to live and play golf but as an important representation of puerto rico this has been my dream for many years a part of our family and we treat it as such that is why we want to create the most positive visual and environmental impact on the area
8685237 what most people dont know about the trump development is that since the beginning my grandfather has been concerned about the environment actually way before i started working with this project three years ago it was my uncle who was working closely with the u s fish amp wildlife service particularly to conserve coco beachs mangroves and wetlands for us this is more of a family project than merely a commercial one
8685238 i brought a special friend a great american success story
8685239 hes from puerto rico married 15 years and has children ages 14 12 and 10
8685240 puerto rico has always been an area of interest to us and were very excited about bringing our great assortment of merchandise to puerto rican consumers who happen to be very fashion savvy and price conscious a perfect market fit for burlingtons brand labels at value prices
8685241 most importantly with each of our stores we should help create about 100 full time and part time new jobs and in such difficult economic times the savings we bring for our consumers will be greatly appreciated
8685242 definitely burlington is about a lot more than coats but thats how we started and have evolved into a retail one stop shop for the entire family since we shop the world for our coats we carry more than 200 different lines of coats we know our selection of coats will still be ideal for college students those who travel to cold weather for business or pleasure
8685243 we feel puerto rico is the natural next step as we continue to connect with our core customer young men and women
8685244 the energy of the teens in puerto rico mixed with our excitement for being here will prove the right fit
8685245 with the anticipation of the opening growing as well as the companys success in the united sates we know aeropostale will becomes a teen favorite in puerto rico
8685246 this is one of the developments were most excited about
8685247 the fact that this significant effort is not only going to attract new retailers but also give our own local stores the opportunities to grow with them is wonderful the capri store one of our main tenants will relocate and take an even larger retail space
8685248 we offer both types of coffee at the mall and theyre both successful the starbucks concept is a retail experience customers are willing to pay for whereas coffee drinkers who love puerto rican coffee are likely not to switch by adding starbucks to our tenant mix we simply expand the choices we offer our clients
8685249 were very excited about our new location which features the chains new store design beyond the retail cases this store is a self treat location featuring our line of chocolate frozen drinks our chocolate dipped jumbo strawberries the customized assorted chocolate boxes and our popular chocolixir already a best seller
8685250 the san juan waterfront when its all finished will be up to the standards of the best waterfronts in the mediterranean and the best known in the united states such as south street seaport and baltimore
8685251 the housing development will use a much more modern practical and attractive urban design all buildings will have commercial spaces on the first floor with a preference given to residents who want to open their own small businesses its a way to foster entrepreneurship
8685252 this is a very exciting aspect of the entire development
8685253 there are six major ppp initiatives ongoing mainly housing projects in areas that used to be dilapidated or underutilized
8685254 bechara must be remodeled in tune with the new puerto rico i have been here since 1982 and have dedicated all my efforts to work with the local government to improve the area because we cannot expect the government to do it all
8685255 we have already acquired an entire block on georgetti street except one parcel at a 5 million investment this was a dilapidated area plagued with prostitution we are going to demolish the structures and make the space available to investors and developers so they can build projects that promote housing retail stores and light commercial spaces for the next generation of doctors lawyers accountants engineers dentists and more
8685256 we want to get the permits and financing lined up getting the financing isnt easy but there might be developers who can finance their own projects we want financing that is accessible
8685257 san francisco has its biobay and singapore its biopolis now puerto rico will be known as bioisland
8685258 this project has actually sparked the flame and created a domino effect in the area enticing entrepreneur to ito mu oz along with a group of investors to redevelop all the area of the former corona beer facility under the citys master development plan
8685259 now pavia hospital santurce has noticed what doctors hospital is doing and wants to do the same it just shows you the domino effect redevelopment has in surrounding areas
8685260 they have been working on the development concept securing permits and are now securing tenants
8685261 this type of public private partnership enables puerto rico to protect and even add value to its land inventory while facilitating important infrastructure development for puerto rico in this case the project will complement the areas existing economic activity as well as accommodate future growth
8685262 right now we are in the design stage for the hotel to be built in the lot next to our sheraton property
8685263 we believe in the districts and puerto ricos possibilities especially now that the lesser antilles are so expensive and require several flights to get to the different islands so we are confident about puerto ricos potential as a one stop flight destination
8685264 that will be the soft opening because as is required we need to be fully functioning 90 days before the official opening which we expect to be around november 2010
8685265 our success in puerto rico reflects our commitment to the highest quality standards so we are pleased to expand our manufacturing capabilities there the expansion of our puerto rico operations enhances our ability to provide life saving devices to people around the world
8685266 st jude medical puerto rico employs some of the most advanced technologies and talented people available in our industry to produce top quality medical devices and products the expansion will further enhance the competitiveness of our operations on the island
8685267 were working closely with the puerto rico aqueduct amp sewer authority prasa on this project because we believe its a priority to the residents of these municipalities it will supply cleaner water to 9 940 families in the area and the thousands of families whose water supply comes from r o grande de lo za because that river begins in san lorenzo
8685268 do you want to sprawl all the way to the north carolina border
8685269 we are talking with the prtc and trying to reach an agreement to make this process more agile
8685270 the board of directors of the tourism development fund tdf and the government development bank gdb approved late last week the direct financing of a 120 million construction loan for the 150 room bah a beach st regis five star hotel in r o grande
8685271 the gdb has the responsibility and the financial capacity to assume its fiscal agent role when the private sector is limited by present economic conditions we will take this role without necessarily competing with the private sector banks the st regis represents an important development in the tourism industry so we must ensure its viability through the tdf as soon as the private banks are in a position to support the project they will do so
8685272 firstbank had preapproved the construction loan but with a gdb full guarantee apparently the gdb decided to provide the financing directly instead of the requested guarantee as a matter of public policy
8685273 i cant deny that the paseo caribe situation has had and is having an impact regarding the perception of financial institutions developers and investors
8685274 antonio mu ozs mu oz holdings and federico s nchezs interlink group are excellent clients with excellent credit we believe in the project and understand the importance it has for puerto rico but we have a fiduciary responsibility to the regulators the credit rating agencies and our shareholders
8685275 beauchamp is not going to let the same dog bite him three times the first time was the marriott courtyard the second paseo caribe and he is not going to let the same dog bite him a third time it would show very poor business judgment and he is a veteran banker with plenty of it the government allowed this situation to happen so now it has to face the consequences this applies not just to firstbank but any other bank willing to finance substantial tourism projects in puerto rico
8685276 in puerto rico there are only three banks left in that segment financing of major tourism projects of the industry firstbank scotiabank and popular
8685277 of course there is an element of discussion among the gdb board of directors but i can only speak as a member of the board of the tourism development fund tdf and the hotel development corp hdc our priority has been and still is to participate in conjunction with private sector banks
8685278 for years tdf and gdb policy has been to not be a direct lender letting private sector banks provide the financing and that continues to be the priority but if private sector banks cant or dont want to assume the risk and demand certain conditions that for them are not negotiable then we have to rethink our function and assume a more active role in the financing of essential tourism development projects such as the five star st regis mandarin and regent
8685279 these projects are so important that even before the discussions with the gdb the hdc had approved investing in the projects as partners we also share the concerns of paseo caribe as hdc has been part of the project
8685280 we have been working hard and the restoration is 75 completed
8685281 the work has been hard because after four years of complete abandonment it has taken us more time than expected to redo the property the site was infested and we had to clean it thoroughly it was also covered by mildew and mold not to mention that we refurbished the 18 hole golf course with the hike in construction costs and the exorbitant operational costs we face our only possibility of success is to make cayo largo an upscale hotel
8685282 thats why were being extra careful with our cayo largo project we need a brand that can embrace all the components of a high end product and we are even considering running it independently as one of the possible scenarios that is yet to be decided and because of it we are in no hurry
8685283 we already reopened three venues under our different flags el portal quality inn a 47 room hotel at condado a 99 room el tuque quality inn in ponce and le consultat on magdalena avenue in condado a 20 room boutique hotel from our clarion collection
8685284 the centro m dico project will have several meeting rooms because right now there are no meeting or group facilities there it will serve the medical community as well as the public in general we havent decided under which flag it will operate because the lease is still being negotiated we still dont know how much the investment for remodeling will be but i guess it wont be cheap when in operation it will employ 10 15 nor do we know yet the brand for the isla verde hotel and surrounding condos which is also in negotiations but it certainly will expand our visibility in puerto rico in a big way i can only say that right now it operates privately under no flag
8685285 for a 100 room hotel 25 employees will be enough but then with a casino depending on its size it will need several more employees
8685286 in march they will begin the demolition of the existing structure the former cardol discount store and in 18 months will have a four story hotel completed
8685287 were not the kind of people who say lets go to a place where there are a thousand other people from new york at the hotel
8685288 indeed this project is emblematic of our firm belief and commitment to invest in puerto rico we cant let cyclical economic changes or difficult economic times cloud our vision of a better puerto rico for future generations plaza internacional is a key component of the ciudad mayor initiative as such we will contribute with the development of a state of the art integrated facility that not only improves the quality of life in the area but also contributes by attracting new investment and creating much needed jobs
8685289 it will be a four star hotel focused on 24 hour service and a diverse offering of restaurants and entertainment options for hotel guests and comfortable rooms averaging 380 square feet to 420 square feet its ideal location only minutes away from the airport and closely located to the metro areas business district will enable the future crowne plaza to attract conventions and special events to its 20 000 square feet of meeting space including a large 11 000 square foot banquet ballroom facility
8685290 my aim in this book was for the reader to learn about puerto rico
8685291 i wanted whoever had been to this island to be able to pick up this book and recognize the culture instantly
8685292 were eliminating 95 of the comic readership by doing this but i didnt give a s
8685293 that this is where ben grimm comes for vacation because he looks like the fort if you remotely resemble anything on this island youre automatically a cult hero
8685294 we were like three school girls at a slumber party
8685295 it was this cool little p r thing we were talking about
8685296 short cultural history of p r for gringos and others
8685297 in this book we really hit on the culture i think puerto rico is probably the fifth member of the fantastic four in this piece
8685298 right now we are evaluating who will be operating those two hotels the dorado beach and cerromar we will also begin evaluating the architectural part and the main issue here will be whether its more feasible to remodel cerromar how to do the rebuilding and the extent of the demolition if it comes to that there are several main issues here to consider
8685299 all this is under evaluation we expect to have some decisions made by january in order for us to proceed
8685300 we first have to go through a design and permitting process which will probably take us all of 2008 and we will hopefully begin construction full blast by the first few months of 2009 we hope to have all the planning structured by the first quarter of next year
8685301 to be a worlds best destination you have to go large scale and thats why were being so cautious in the way we disclose information about this project
8685302 were forming sve studios p r because with a wholly owned puerto rican company we can better capitalize on the many incentives provided to film producers by the puerto rican government puerto ricos diverse topography will also allow us to produce virtually any kind of movie from a wild west ghost story to a pirates movie on the high seas puerto rico has it all working with puerto ricos already strong film production community sve studios p r s business mission is to develop the infrastructure necessary to take a film from pre production through principal photography and then wrap post production on the island this will allow us to circumvent the high cost of working with the studios and unions in hollywood and bring in additional revenue by being a one stop shop for other production companies coming to puerto rico we expect this to be the beginning of a permanent stereo vision presence in puerto rico
8685303 not to stand in the way of the work the team had already begun
8685304 were not belittling the difficulty of the times were going through theres no denying that but we have also made progress in some areas sometimes amid extremely difficult circumstances despite it all puerto rico still has many great assets and competitive advantages over other regional competitors and all of us have the responsibility of continuing to move forward for puerto ricos sake
8685305 despite all of this we were able to move forward several high impact projects four of them in the mayag ez region lockheed martin honeywell aerospace wsifb and essig research abbotts 450 million expansion in barceloneta in a former pfizer building and the expansion of recoms a local bioscience company dedicated to process validation
8685306 chief among the 2008 projects already confirmed is angiotech in aguadilla a medical devices company that will hire 559 people many of them laid off by hewlett packard theyre investing 13 million to retool a pridco building for their expansion others include coopervision in juana d az with 100 employees and a 170 million investment lockheed martin and the bioprocess plant both in mayag ez with a combined 63 million investment and microsofts 52 million digital distribution initiative
8685307 there has been a fundamental change in the way companies are supplying their products globally there has been a shift toward regional coverage from that of traditionally supplying just one jurisdiction companies are taking a regional strategy by supplying full regions as opposed to one individual country and that can change the manufacturing supply chain by shifting production to certain jurisdictions which can better supply a region
8685308 as a result we have seen a significant reduction in the number of new drug approvals in 2005 i believe the fda approved 30 new drugs in 2006 it was 31 new approvals but so far this year only 10 new approvals have been granted combine this with numerous patent expirations which far outweigh the number of new drugs in each companys pipeline and you can clearly see how this imbalance will affect manufacturing plants
8685309 many people measure the success of pridcos efforts solely on the basis of new openings but given the transitional nature of traditional manufacturing around the world retention of existing companies is just as important for every honeywell that begins operations there are many like lifescan already operating here that we have to fight hard to keep from leaving for ireland or other emerging markets we were able to do a lot in 2007 despite difficult times and a nearly expired industrial incentives act
8685310 theyre going through a very comprehensive restructuring process but their commitment to puerto rico remains firm
8685311 our task ahead will be more of a balancing act maintaining what we have while rapidly establishing the kind of infrastructure that will enable us to insert puerto rico in the knowledge economy as a leading competitor our world class high skilled and bilingual labor force coupled with decades of leadership in the manufacturing industry will serve as the launching pad of our biotech and life science industry
8685312 with one million square feet of new laboratory space in addition to various existing lab facilities around the island and the 30 000 square feet of lab space in the new mayag ez facility we will jump right to the major leagues of the biotech and life sciences industry up until now we didnt have the kind of capital needed to effectively compete on a global scale the land transfer capitalizes the trust for future construction which in turn guarantees an ongoing source of income to support our quest to become bioisland
8685313 large municipalities received matching funds a dollar for each dollar they invested whereas smaller municipalities got their initiative under way in partnership with manufacturing companies and trade organizations who donate in kind services staff and equipment
8685314 we are looking at various solutions to identify funds for more researchers meanwhile as part of the legislative effort to approve a new economic incentives law were also recommending relevant tax exemptions credits recruitment subsidies and other incentives not only to attract but to retain the worlds top scientists
8685315 with 4 581 new rooms already under way were 93 closer to our 5 000 new room goal and well have the rest secured before year end
8685316 last year was a tough year but we managed to make progress in each of our strategic areas hotel development air access marketing product development and customer service were on track with our first bond issue which will help us capitalize the hotel development corp and participate as facilitators in the development of top projects as we increase our room inventory weve attracted renowned hotel flags including our first three five star hotels compared to none just four years ago
8685317 after last years tourism investment forum we received many calls from local property or land owners expressing their interest in selling their real estate through our catalog each property will be evaluated on its merit to make sure it fits with the development strategy for that particular region
8685318 the fastest growing numbers in hotel occupancy in puerto rico are coming from this region in 2005 2006 the area registered a 4 4 increase in hotel occupancy and last year 2007 averaged 69 3 even higher than the islands 68 4 average
8685319 one of the most challenging aspects of expanding our air access has been the decentralization of airport arrivals meaning creating opportunities for more and more passengers to fly into aguadilla or ponce instead of luis mu oz mar n international airport in isla verde the 4 million fund created for this purpose has helped us secure 29 new flights to regional airports with an economic impact of 120 million to complement the tourism development initiatives in porta del sol and porta caribe but theres still more work to do in this area clearly hotel development within those regions must also continue to meet passenger projected demand
8685320 again our difficult economic situation coupled with signs of trouble with the stateside economy has forced us to be more aggressive in marketing this has also opened up opportunities to diversify our tourism product as we saw with the puerto rico open the salsa congress saborea gourmet festival the culebra heineken international regatta and many other opportunities despite difficult times porta del sol registered an 8 5 increase in nonresident registrations and porta caribe 5 which points to the need of increasing room inventory in those regions as well
8685321 indeed the economic situation has slowed down slot machine and casino revenue in general but it will not impact the bond issue we will proceed as planned
8685322 in addition to the recession which has impacted the industry as a whole well continue to partner with the treasury department to fight illegal video games which is truly putting a dent in casino profits
8685323 efforts are very advanced and many of the strategies included in the branding platform have been outlined i do believe we will see a unified branding initiative for puerto rico soon with the support of various industry sectors i think it will work precisely because of the involvement of the private sector from day one however consensus on this subject is crucial to make sure all puerto ricans understand what the brand is all about rally around it and most importantly feel empowered to promote the brand accordingly
8685324 we continue with our ongoing maintenance and repairs program top security and new feasibility studies to develop the centers second phase for additional capacity
8685325 which well accommodate with outdoor tents also our coordination of citywide conventions has gotten very effective with shuttle services to and from the convention center and hotels in the entire san juan metro area
8685326 as room inventory within the district increases we will also be able to increase our service capacity
8685327 were also evaluating construction of the second hotel in the area a marriott courtyard even the sheraton is considering an additional 250 rooms once it inaugurates its first phase bringing the areas total room inventory to 1 000
8685328 every year the quality of events goes up making it a very exciting venue for all puerto rican and foreign promoters this year well see a great disney on ice show thats second to none and anything with the disney franchise name represents an important vote of confidence in our venue
8685329 the most important aspect of this program is what we call capturing where we help entrepreneurs prepare to become successful business owners from the 30 hour business plan course to the advanced course where the person validates his or her business plan after completing a 12 hour business administration course
8685330 while 2007 was a difficult year for many sectors puerto ricos small and midsize businesses effectively competed helping the economy move forward under our flagship program we secured more than 800 new businesses for puerto rico that represent an investment of 36 million and more than 9 000 new jobs
8685331 at our cetpymes the fast track permit processing centers for small businesses we try to eliminate the guessing and complications often associated with the permit process at cetpymes the business can process its valid permits from the regulations amp permits administration arpe the health department and the trade co in 20 days down from 120 prior to the new fast track permit system since the program began last september we have reviewed more than 13 000 cases approved 11 998 plus another 1 000 subject to some conditions
8685332 through the single certification process all of the participating agencies can view the profile of the company and facilitate communication and payment processes when doing business with the government
8685333 the combined results of these trade missions have a projected sales potential of 32 million among the 251 companies that participated
8685334 as we make our operations more efficient by leveraging the international offices currently in the dominican republic costa rica panama chile and spain facilitating access to more local companies in the free trade zone program directing our international trade missions to potential markets and helping new exporters through puerto rico exporta the greater our return on investment is from trade and export activities
8685335 the strike certainly slowed down our production but we are back on track with 32 projects in the pipeline including short films another challenge we face is insurance given our tropical weather and somewhat limited filming period and because of our hurricane season productions tend to line up their projects during the first half of the year so we are working on other programs like the one to develop new screenwriters or special collaborations like the popular chilean novela soap opera that is being shot on the island in the area of dorado with both puerto rican and chilean actors
8685336 the land administration has the unique opportunity to participate in a myriad of diverse development projects last year our efforts contributed to advancing the development of the san juan waterfront primarily by making possible two such key projects as harbor plaza adjacent to the ochoa building with a 130 million investment and capitolio plaza also in the area which has finished its first tower with a 50 million investment and is set to start the second tower for an additional 90 million
8685337 our current development pipeline includes seven major projects with a combined investment of 450 million over the next two years and from the tourism end were working with the prtc on the development of the tourism real estate catalog which includes the development of such projects as la pared de luquillo and luc a estate in yabucoa in many instances we secure all the permits for the proposed development and turn them over to the developers so they are ready to start construction
8685338 first we had to determine which specific properties were available after that determination dtop had to establish the property location size title liens if any on the property any drawings available in their files description of structures if any on the property past and present use and other relevant information necessary for the sale
8685339 after puerto ricos double victory in the caribbean classic we have become its official and permanent home that makes us very proud but also opens up a myriad of development and training opportunities for our local breeders as well as potential jockeys
8685340 weve seen a strong start to 2008 on the betting side and after six years we have secured funding and resources to operate la esmeralda equine park in the south region of the island
8685341 the big problem in the 1940s and 50s was that we had too many people
8685342 the island was overpopulated and now ironically it may be the reverse to the extent puerto ricans migrate to the mainland u s where the economy may have better prospects it will actually make the situation worse
8685343 when birthrates and populations decline and the dependent population mainly seniors outpace workers an economy usually enters a long period of stagnation and reduced living standards
8685344 thats the risk now faced by puerto rico within the next 20 years
8685345 developed countries at least got a chance to grow rich before they grew old today most developing countries are growing old before they get rich
8685346 on the consumer side the steep rise in 65 will depress consumer demand as seniors either will not have the disposable income to spend much or will not have the need to spend even if they have the income or savings
8685347 this whole trend will drag down median purchasing power and therefore overall sales on the island put a significant strain on government coffers higher social spending and a smaller tax base and otherwise hurt prospects for economic growth and prosperity
8685348 the sales and growth crisis will spread to other product categories and the economy as a whole
8685349 will probably increase the labor participation rate or the proportion of people between 16 and 65 who are in the work force since younger people generally have lower participation rates
8685350 from a labor standpoint companies that dont prepare now for this situation that is coming will not last in the market
8685351 given the dwindling number of people who will be available in the local talent pool those who are available may not necessarily have the required skill sets required by companies
8685352 the majority of students are women which means that 15 to 20 years from now there will be more women than men in the labor force
8685353 because more women will be working they will have fewer children as happens with most women who work today this will further contribute to declines in population and ultimately in the labor pool
8685354 puerto rico is not ready for this type of change
8685355 i dont see the government taking any steps to prepare for this which will negatively affect us if no action is taken the one thing in our favor now is that were still on time to prepare
8685356 the government will have to reorient its focus toward the growing elderly population
8685357 for example primary education costs will have to be reduced from now until 2025 and government priorities will have to be refocused to address the needs of the aging population such as health issues
8685358 the elderly population have all sorts of needs and therefore it creates markets that at this time may not exist
8685359 for example housing for the elderly becomes an interesting market as well as services to care for the elderly things like cruise ships which is an attractive vacation option traditionally popular among older individuals
8685360 so you have a bigger market for this sort of entertainment the population shift presents lots of challenges but also lots of opportunities
8685361 we need to work on keeping our doctors on the island and on training our medical staff in geriatrics in order to keep pace with the demand
8685362 in puerto rico we have a problem with long term planning and this is one of those issues where everybody sees that problems are brewing ahead but they say it is too far away
8685363 if nothing is done it could mean a severe economic slowdown we will have a big portion of the population without the means to support itself and an economy that will not be able to grow because there will not be enough labor to support growth this demographic alert should be on top of the priority list
8685364 we are doing a pre opening ceremony to thank all the people involved in the project from carpenters to engineers and their families it is a very special occasion because it marks the beginning of our paseo gastron mico de san germ n or san germ n gastronomic route a concept that includes three more restaurants around the town square that will be developed and managed by interpec next on the list is o dougalls authentic irish pub a concept we also developed on the mainland that should be ready by next summer because it doesnt need construction and all the equipment has been ordered it will employ 18 people
8685365 for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of america my sons and i came up with a theme that fuses spanish mexican and american cuisine this will be the biggest of all our restaurants with two levels and 235 seats and approximately 50 employees and last but not least will be pink lobster a seafood restaurant that will seat 175 people and employ 35 people
8685366 because our prices will be the same in puerto rico and the mainland our meats will be top choice always fresh not frozen and our lobsters will be from maine although we are going to be profitable we will always be thinking of delivering the best quality at the lowest price to our customers there is no way people wont want to come to san germ n the best food at the best price and the scenery alone is worth the trip
8685367 the fast track permit process worked well they followed up with pending documents and helped move projects from one reviewing agency to the next expediting the overall process we hope the new permits system scheduled to be in place within a month or so follows some of the same processing principles of the task force
8685368 these projects are extremely important for puerto rico because they help keep the economy moving forward with much needed construction jobs new permanent jobs and retail sales what i like the most about these developments is that theyre small to mid size commercial centers located throughout the island in areas where the local community truly needs those services
8685369 prior to 2006 the local office market was very stable with vacancy rates in the range of 8 to 10 since 2006 however the prime office real estate market has been increasing its vacancy rate to a level of 14 and up to 16 in some cases
8685370 in order to compete many landlords remodeled while having to keep the same rents or in some cases reducing these in reaction to the local market situation
8685371 the construction costs are higher and since demand is slowing the vacancy ratio will certainly grow even more
8685372 banks are more careful in the analysis of their clients capacity to repay loans and this will further restrict the financing alternative for user buyers on the other hand the decrease in interest rates and stable market values make the current commercial real estate market a buyers market
8685373 this would double the number of existing class a and b buildings commercial banks indirectly control construction by approving loans to developers that have leased at least 50 or more of a building but how do we control the space that is left behind the natural balance in the real estate market forecasts that prices will inevitably go down
8685374 sometimes that serves as an excuse to put a young man in jail when he needs a different kind of treatment
8685375 in puerto rico thats an issue that nobody wants to touch
8685376 its a proposal that we should be open to discussing
8685377 its very simple dvd piracy is stealing and therefore a crime every time an individual buys a duplicate dvd copy he or she becomes an accomplice in that criminal enterprise
8685378 this illegal activity which will be prosecuted is wiping out years of hard work to position puerto rico as a top film market
8685379 independent film making is a tough and competitive business as it is mostly due to limited financing options
8685380 puerto rico releases have been simultaneous with those on the mainland u s however it could take weeks or even months to reach some latin american markets by the time releases get there our puerto ricos black market distributors would have sold thousands of copies in advance killing chances of box office success in those markets
8685381 the local black market has gotten so big that it is having an impact on stateside revenues film studios find themselves fighting illegal online sales and movie file sharing even before films hit stateside theaters
8685382 so far my distribution hasnt been affected but as soon as sonys legal department deems it appropriate to hold back a release to protect its investment it can do just that
8685383 if a blockbuster film is distributed before release time our chances to recoup our investment are greatly reduced
8685384 this has an impact on movie theaters since they depend on moviegoers and concession sales to maintain operations the video division also feels the impact since black market copies reduce movie rentals and even dvd sales
8685385 remains vigilant inside our theaters and will report any suspicious activity in the end moviegoers are the ones inconvenienced
8685386 we organized the conference around the many areas of interest to investors in which puerto rico offers unique opportunities
8685387 the response so far has been very positive we are getting a lot of interest from investors in the u s and puerto rico
8685388 our mission is to showcase puerto ricos business sector and its many possibilities as we strengthen it with this type of event
8685389 puerto ricos food industry track record during the past two years is best described as impressive and somewhat unprecedented with some 125 to 150 new food establishments opened during that period of time i do not know of any other industry sector within our local economy that continues to grow at the rate of the local food industry
8685390 our food industry is a great example and a solid business case study of what entrepreneurs can do when market conditions get tough we got creative sought greater efficiency increased product diversity secured better technology applications to facilitate operations and delivered better service most importantly we faced the competition head on instead of retreating ourselves instead of being afraid of the proverbial big bad wolf as so many describe the megastores
8685391 instead the majority of our food retailers wholesalers and food distributors chose to put up a good and fair battle and today theyre not only growing but giving some of these large companies a good run for their money
8685392 the story of our supermarket industry is that of one that has grown thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of our people folks who recognize that theres only one constant in our business and that constant is change those who have their ears to the ground who are hands on in their business and keep abreast of the latest trends both locally and worldwide can anticipate local changes and decide whether to adapt or not
8685393 many of those who in the early 1990s refused to change are no longer around to tell their story fortunately the majority of our local key players recognized the arrival of the multinationals well in advance and thanks to their entrepreneurial spirit and preparedness they have made our food industry stronger than ever i bet the multinationals never thought our local entrepreneurs would be as smart and resilient as they are
8685394 the fact that we continue to grow is not only a good indication that even when things get tough if we organize ourselves we can thrive and succeed most importantly i think puerto ricos food industry leads by example in what it means to bet on puerto rico to keep reinvesting in the local economy and not stand by waiting for what can or should be given to us but rather going after what we want in the end by strengthening our food industry were making puerto ricos economy more financially solid and we are laying fertile ground for other industries to do the same
8685395 puerto ricos food industry is a dynamic changing and proactive industry most importantly it is a customer driven industry where the voice of the consumer is very much a part of the way we do business todays consumers are more sophisticated and knowledgeable about products nutritional values and other industry trends consumers have also become more demanding regarding price convenience store appeal and security given the hectic lives most puerto ricans live they also prefer to meet their food needs with as few visits to the store as possible and get what they need all in one place
8685396 if i had to do it all over again id do it exactly the same way
8685397 i have the utmost respect for our local food industry its a tough business but it keeps puerto rico healthy and the economy moving forward im honored to be a part of it
8685398 as a matter of fact one of my first calls after acquiring pueblo was to mr toppel whom i consider a mentor he was moved by the gesture and of course willing to help in any way he could
8685399 meanwhile we continue to invest to bring the stores to optimum conditions next in line is the reconstruction of 94 000 lineal feet of refrigerators and well continue to deliver the best service the food industry has something amazing happens when you can hire back so many employees who had lost their jobs they come back with greater appreciation for what it means to come to work every day i have no doubt i have the most motivated workforce on the island
8685400 whatever you do in life do it with passion thats the secret whether its mopping the floor or running a multimillion dollar corporation
8685401 our strength comes from our union its as simple as that
8685402 we are the most diverse group of entrepreneurs working together in puerto rico each one of us is an owner operator thats why we pour our hearts and energy into our stores to make sure we stay in touch with the clients needs at all times collectively were a force to be reckoned with
8685403 i see no limits to what econo can do as i said earlier our strength comes from our union and the cohesiveness we find as we come together as a family a family of 32 individual owners members things can happen and if one of our stores faces difficulties and has to close that is unfortunate but we will continue to work together to avoid that from ever happening you can throw one of us out but you cant throw all of us out so econo is going to be around for a long time
8685404 yes the acquisition of pueblo could have facilitated some of the plans we have especially to grow our distribution to keep pace with the stores growth but by no means will we stop growing were already working on expansion plans for our distribution center and more stores
8685405 for a moment think about the strength and soundness our industry has at the time of pueblos bidding process not one or two or even three but rather four local companies were in a position to successfully acquire the pueblo stores thats fantastic and true testimony that puerto ricos food industry is one of the most solid industries in our local economy to date
8685406 as an industry we couldnt have let the closing of pueblo go without doing something about it as a sector we are stronger and better because pueblo can continue to operate
8685407 the fact of the matter is that the expansion of supermarket chains stateside and local alike has brought a greater level of convenience to even some of the most remote areas around the island that many years ago relied on the colmaditos for their main grocery shopping nowadays not only roads are better and cars more prevalent but supermarkets are more accessible and convenient for consumers
8685408 that is not to say however that competition from larger formats like megastores and food clubs hasnt contributed to the segments market share decline but it has not been the only factor
8685409 what we have noticed however is that small businesses have not switched entirely to purchasing their weekly provisions from the traditional wholesalers they are visiting both the grocery wholesaler and the food club
8685410 iris observations indicate many of the small businesses will purchase beverages and paper products at the food club when on sale for example yet buy the bulk of their other provisions from the traditional grocery wholesaler
8685411 i am not afraid of anyone as a matter of fact whenever possible id like to open a ralphs wherever the megastores have one of theirs initially i was seriously criticized when i decided to jump into this industry segment at a time when many key players were leaving i realized that even before megastores arrived puerto rico still had underserved areas i decided to prepare for their arrival adapt to new market conditions and compete and compete we have
8685412 i figured we needed spacious and modern locations to serve customers the way they deserved i decided to establish the warehouse operation adjacent to the retail supermarket and serve both types of customers at the same time that way i leverage the investment and logistics of the warehouse and could supply my retail stores from my own warehouse immediately without delays and at convenient prices
8685413 i still see tremendous growth opportunities i have yet to go to guaynabo bayam n and on to r o grande can vanas and lo za
8685414 the key to success is to work every day remain involved in every aspect of the business educate yourself about the latest industry trends and maintain the greatest variety competitive prices and best service
8685415 the industry has been transforming over the past 10 to 15 years as key players adapt they have chosen different ways to compete from a revised version of the traditional cash amp carry to new hybrid concepts or others who have completely migrated toward the retail end of the industry we have stayed with the traditional cash amp carry format but carrying packaging options that some of the larger food clubs cant or dont do has given us an important competitive edge some of the large food clubs like sams club owned by wal mart operate a food club but also serve individual customers we only want to serve small business owners and make sure we give them the tools to continue growing their businesses
8685416 we have also been very successful with our el criollazo marketing program through it clients are feature in our shopper and can also advertise their store locations we also place banners and develop other point of sale materials for them
8685417 the best example of how we better serve our customers through el criollazo is the volume discounts we can pass on to our customers so that a local drugstore like farmacia ruiz belvis can sell a two liter coca cola bottle for seventy nine cents like the large supermarket chains
8685418 most importantly as long as they remain competitive in their service and the type of packaging options they can offer theyll always have a solid market to serve they need to continue increasing their variety and diversifying their service by expanding delivery operation hours and even offering credit options to facilitate payment all of these measures will go a long way to serve the islands small businesses and colmaditos which are vital in the food sales chain for thousands of families
8685419 were truly excited about the construction of this integrated facility this not only represents an important investment in the future of our company but a vote of confidence about the future of our industry and puerto rico
8685420 we have excellent competitors and that helps us all keep the industry growing and moving forward
8685421 when wal mart decided to come to puerto rico it was because it saw an opportunity to bring its everyday low prices philosophy to the local retail market that successful formula was extended to the food industry segment and we have been extremely successful there too
8685422 but what were most proud of is our record of excellence in all aspects of the operations which not only affords us the opportunity to deliver everyday low prices but provide the best service to our customers by doing so we have elevated the industrys standards and competitive level only resulting in a stronger industry and with greater advantages for consumers
8685423 this is one of the programs that were particular proud of our suppliers partners program whereby we can sell excellent quality merchandise from local manufacturers and distributors which allows us to reinvest in the local economy and help local businesses grow
8685424 in fact some of our suppliers have not only placed their products through our local operations but companies such as arroz rico carlas sweets and a whole series of fresh produce products are now introduced and sold through our wal mart stores in other markets
8685425 delivers traditional mexican dishes with a twist more like tex mex combined with an american influence typically found at border locations between mexico and the u s
8685426 the whole corillo staff from ir just got back from dallas where we had a chance to taste the entire menu and go through the on the border experience im convinced puerto rico not only will like the concept but will enjoy the blend of good food affordable dining and an entertaining ambiance
8685427 our original plan with chilis was to open five locations in five years we ended up with eight within that time and are now up to 15
8685428 we will include a hydrogen station that residents and guests can use for their hydrogen propelled vehicles
8685429 we have already initiated talks with some manufacturers that have prototypes for this type of car like bmw mercedes benz toyota honda and volkswagen
8685430 divided in two sectors the first is about 46 acres and is on the west side of the property along the esp ritu santo river the second area is about 44 acres and is also on the west side of the property next to the service parcel to secure the protection of this land our family created a title deed called a perpetuity natural reserve
8685431 we not only view our property as a beautiful place to live and play golf but as an important representation of puerto rico this has been my dream for many years a part of our family and we treat it as such that is why we want to create the most positive visual and environmental impact on the area
8685432 what most people dont know about the trump development is that since the beginning my grandfather has been concerned about the environment actually way before i started working with this project three years ago it was my uncle who was working closely with the u s fish amp wildlife service particularly to conserve coco beachs mangroves and wetlands for us this is more of a family project than merely a commercial one
8685433 i brought a special friend a great american success story
8685434 hes from puerto rico married 15 years and has children ages 14 12 and 10
8685435 puerto rico has always been an area of interest to us and were very excited about bringing our great assortment of merchandise to puerto rican consumers who happen to be very fashion savvy and price conscious a perfect market fit for burlingtons brand labels at value prices
8685436 most importantly with each of our stores we should help create about 100 full time and part time new jobs and in such difficult economic times the savings we bring for our consumers will be greatly appreciated
8685437 definitely burlington is about a lot more than coats but thats how we started and have evolved into a retail one stop shop for the entire family since we shop the world for our coats we carry more than 200 different lines of coats we know our selection of coats will still be ideal for college students those who travel to cold weather for business or pleasure
8685438 we feel puerto rico is the natural next step as we continue to connect with our core customer young men and women
8685439 the energy of the teens in puerto rico mixed with our excitement for being here will prove the right fit
8685440 with the anticipation of the opening growing as well as the companys success in the united sates we know aeropostale will becomes a teen favorite in puerto rico
8685441 this is one of the developments were most excited about
8685442 the fact that this significant effort is not only going to attract new retailers but also give our own local stores the opportunities to grow with them is wonderful the capri store one of our main tenants will relocate and take an even larger retail space
8685443 we offer both types of coffee at the mall and theyre both successful the starbucks concept is a retail experience customers are willing to pay for whereas coffee drinkers who love puerto rican coffee are likely not to switch by adding starbucks to our tenant mix we simply expand the choices we offer our clients
8685444 were very excited about our new location which features the chains new store design beyond the retail cases this store is a self treat location featuring our line of chocolate frozen drinks our chocolate dipped jumbo strawberries the customized assorted chocolate boxes and our popular chocolixir already a best seller
8685445 the san juan waterfront when its all finished will be up to the standards of the best waterfronts in the mediterranean and the best known in the united states such as south street seaport and baltimore
8685446 the housing development will use a much more modern practical and attractive urban design all buildings will have commercial spaces on the first floor with a preference given to residents who want to open their own small businesses its a way to foster entrepreneurship
8685447 this is a very exciting aspect of the entire development
8685448 there are six major ppp initiatives ongoing mainly housing projects in areas that used to be dilapidated or underutilized
8685449 bechara must be remodeled in tune with the new puerto rico i have been here since 1982 and have dedicated all my efforts to work with the local government to improve the area because we cannot expect the government to do it all
8685450 we have already acquired an entire block on georgetti street except one parcel at a 5 million investment this was a dilapidated area plagued with prostitution we are going to demolish the structures and make the space available to investors and developers so they can build projects that promote housing retail stores and light commercial spaces for the next generation of doctors lawyers accountants engineers dentists and more
8685451 we want to get the permits and financing lined up getting the financing isnt easy but there might be developers who can finance their own projects we want financing that is accessible
8685452 san francisco has its biobay and singapore its biopolis now puerto rico will be known as bioisland
8685453 this project has actually sparked the flame and created a domino effect in the area enticing entrepreneur to ito mu oz along with a group of investors to redevelop all the area of the former corona beer facility under the citys master development plan
8685454 now pavia hospital santurce has noticed what doctors hospital is doing and wants to do the same it just shows you the domino effect redevelopment has in surrounding areas
8685455 they have been working on the development concept securing permits and are now securing tenants
8685456 this type of public private partnership enables puerto rico to protect and even add value to its land inventory while facilitating important infrastructure development for puerto rico in this case the project will complement the areas existing economic activity as well as accommodate future growth
8685457 right now we are in the design stage for the hotel to be built in the lot next to our sheraton property
8685458 we believe in the districts and puerto ricos possibilities especially now that the lesser antilles are so expensive and require several flights to get to the different islands so we are confident about puerto ricos potential as a one stop flight destination
8685459 that will be the soft opening because as is required we need to be fully functioning 90 days before the official opening which we expect to be around november 2010
8685460 our success in puerto rico reflects our commitment to the highest quality standards so we are pleased to expand our manufacturing capabilities there the expansion of our puerto rico operations enhances our ability to provide life saving devices to people around the world
8685461 st jude medical puerto rico employs some of the most advanced technologies and talented people available in our industry to produce top quality medical devices and products the expansion will further enhance the competitiveness of our operations on the island
8685462 were working closely with the puerto rico aqueduct amp sewer authority prasa on this project because we believe its a priority to the residents of these municipalities it will supply cleaner water to 9 940 families in the area and the thousands of families whose water supply comes from r o grande de lo za because that river begins in san lorenzo
8685463 ooops little sally got lost today lets put up found posters shall we and if we cant find her oh dear well i hope shes okay and found a good home somewhere
8685464 but there are ways to prevent little sally the puppy version from getting lost

8685467 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8685468 barack obama has got to appeal to the people who are still disaffected
8685469 has to reassure those people they will be included and that theres room for them under the democratic tent make them feel at home
8685470 is not alone in convincing naysayers inside or outside of his party that he should be president
8685471 there are two issues that barack obama really has to deal with
8685472 the economy and the war in iraq people want out of this war as soon as possible and they want a new direction for the economy
8685473 that should bring swing voters his direction at least in my state of north carolina
8685474 he needs to say to everybody try me digest me
8685475 his persona is such that people are going to be attracted to him to what he has to say if you can see him and hear him speak hes very persuasive so i hope he gets out and sees more people and more people hear him
8685476 liability driven investing what has changed over the last year
8685477 a portfolio designed to be risk managed with respect to liabilities
8685478 because we receive a contribution equivalent of 1 of the gross national product per year there is scope to make the shift without having to sell out of existing portfolios
8685479 the economic environment in the first six months of 2008 was extremely hostile compared with the same period last year
8685480 weaker markets and subdued demand for investment products particularly from retail investors put pressure on our fee income
8685481 wir unternehmen gro e anstrengungen um die richtige einstellung f r diese strecke zu finden
8685482 gleichzeitig achten wir sehr genau auf die zuverl ssigkeit und wie sich das auto auf den kerbs verh lt damit hatten wir im letzten jahr probleme

8685487 it has been a great pleasure to work with such a talented individual whose grasp of a wide variety of complex issues has been second to none
8685488 wat zou het mooi zijn als nederland ooit weer de olympische spelen zou kunnen organiseren bijvoorbeeld in 2028 precies honderd jaar na de spelen in amsterdam samen met noc nsf verkennen we daartoe de mogelijkheden
8685489 zou ik dit in een volgend overleg met de grote steden toch maar eens op de agenda zetten je denkt toch niet dat er ook maar n ioc lid aan ons een stem geeft als ze niet naar de hoeren kunnen
8685490 ik heb zelf dagenlang door de stad rondgereden om ze te halen en te brengen
8685491 it was consistent with government policy and training apprentices is a high priority in a period of skills shortages

8685495 exercise his discretion and not issue a criminal justice visa advice he ignored
8685496 this document raises the question that the minister was asking the department only to be told what he wanted to hear dr haneefs lawyer rod hodgson told news ltd
8685497 would make a good colloquial buzzword for it was to accumulate libertarian oriented political arguments within a certain logical structure and publish them with very little or no bureaucracy and have the ideas get around through search engines or even
8685498 world that is a technique that actually works but it may separate me from people who need me

8685530 speaking at the democratic national convention about sen barack obamas foreign policy judgment biden stated that obama has advocated for two additional battalions in afghanistan in fact obama called for two extra brigades a small verbal slip but a significant numerical one a brigade is composed of a varying number of battalions for the gop it is sure to be fodder for their efforts to label biden a gaffe machine

8685532 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8685533 our fans and sponsors would rather not see south koreans win so many tournaments so we will begin every tournament by penalizing south korean players three strokes if they dont like it they can go home nobody is forcing them to play

8685564 9 to 5 a musical stage version of the hit 1980 movie in which she starred has been postponed for a few days the center theatre group which is producing the play at the ahmanson theatre cites technical problems lets hope theres nothing more to the delay than that
8685565 this is not only one of the biggest but also one of the best and most spectacular productions we have ever presented at the ahmanson
8685566 but the technical demands are enormous and we must afford the creative team and cast the time to develop the show to the level of quality that it and our audiences deserve
8685567 oh whats two to three more days on a project that weve worked two to three years on
8685568 the sets and the technical end of things are more involved on this musical than they were on the movie and its going to look fantastic

8685588 i personally think that the optimal connection will be personally managed hard drives
8685589 blu ray disc or hd dvd quality content or better will be possible but you wont get that quality from a download the reality is that its cheaper and faster to send hard drives with terabytes of content overnight via ups than it is to download it over the net brown is faster than the net
8685590 so the smart company will send you hard drives full of content that you will pick and choose from
8685591 you people talk a lot of shit for being clueless
8685592 were very very happy about our relationship with google and this makes sure that mozilla will be sustainable and thrive for quite a long time to come
8685593 we develop our product and technical direction as part of an open process unrelated to the search relationship with google we talk to google about the parts of the product that offer google services i e the firefox start page and the services they provide like anti phishing otherwise google does not have any special relationship to mozilla project activities
8685594 what does mozilla do with all that cash money if theyre non profit
8685595 mozilla uses the funds to pay staff support its bandwidth and hardware infrastructure and to distribute a number of grants
8685596 were very very happy about our relationship with google and this makes sure that mozilla will be sustainable and thrive for quite a long time to come
8685597 the deal will ensure that the non profit mozilla foundation will be able to continue with the development of firefox its mail client thunderbird and a number of other applications
8685598 the mozilla corporation abbreviated moco is a wholly owned subsidiary of the mozilla foundation that coordinates and integrates the development of internet related applications such as the mozilla firefox web browser and the mozilla thunderbird email client
8685599 any profits made by the mozilla corporation will be invested back into the mozilla project there will be no shareholders no stock options will be issued and no dividends will be paid the mozilla corporation will not be floating on the stock market and it will be impossible for any company to take over or buy a stake in the subsidiary
8685600 im a big fan of mozilla but one of the reasons they formed moco was so they wouldnt have to disclose how much theyre making off google
8685601 if i were them id be looking for deals with yahoo msn and ask just to diversify their revenue stream a bit
8685602 i wouldve thought the figure would be way higher than 57m considering they have 14 of the browser market
8685603 the mozilla foundation is a non profit organization that owns two for profit companies that earmark all profits for the foundations open source projects

8685617 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8685618 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
8685619 this is a rare chance to see world class bowling here in aberdeen so local people should seize the opportunity to watch a fantastic competition unfold up close
8685620 we are not trying to preach to anyone and tell them they shouldnt drink alcohol or that all drinking is bad
8685621 the aim of this campaign is primarily to work in partnership to understand local drinking patterns and to increase awareness of the effects and associated risks of alcohol
8685622 we are aiming to encourage the general public to assess and challenge their drinking habits while taking responsibility for their own health its ok to have some alcohol free days while eating or drinking water in between drinks can extend a good night out
8685623 all the information is anonymous and will be used to establish current behaviour patterns and beliefs relating to alcohol and its use
8685624 this is an extremely worthwhile campaign which paves the way for alcohol awareness week it will be very interesting to see what people of all ages from students to older people really think about drinking
8685625 i would encourage everyone to take just a few minutes to fill in the questionnaire so we can obtain as clear a picture as possible

8685629 disse cristiano ronaldo durante a cerim nia que decorreu no m naco
8685630 it looked like it was an old military uniform he was dressed like a state trooper but the outfit you could tell it was a little older he did have the pins and things on the collar
8685631 i started asking him questions and he started fumbling over his words and he started getting a little bit more nervous
8685632 i dont think he expected to come to the door and have somebody interrogate him
8685633 we would want the public to call as soon as possible if they come in contact with this individual because we want to get this individual off the street as soon as possible he is out there falsely representing msp
8685634 he did have two gold teeth on the left hand side and a very short close to the face goatee that was also shocking because i havent seen another state trooper with one of those
8685635 confidence in the bridge safety inspection process has been shaken
8685636 blackwater has a much better idea of what an effective peace keeping mission would look like than western governments
8685637 im so sick of hearing that nothing can be done
8685638 if they were met by a mobile quick reaction force of african union soldiers the janjaweed would quickly learn their habits were not sustainable
8685639 there are always going to be some pieces that the private sector can help in
8685640 its preposterous to think there is some magic silver bullet that takes the form of blackwater or any other private military contractor to solve the problems in darfur
8685641 we all get along together thats the good part no one is teasing each other if they are its not anything to hurt anyone
8685642 i dont have to try to be who im not when im here i can just be myself and not worry about anything
8685643 its so expensive for these kids to come to camp they do fundraising year round its 100 percent free for their families their parents
8685644 we invest in great people and companies with compelling products or services that have the potential to become industry leaders and innovators
8685645 webcarzz provides a unique and compelling investment opportunity in the high growth online games market which is forecasted to reach 13 1b in global revenue by 2012
8685646 with over 300 million online gamers today the time is ripe for virtual worlds and multiplayer online games

8685648 in terms of geographic area we have almost the second largest school district in the state of michigan its almost 300 square miles
8685649 and so those 130 buses cover an awful lot of territory to the tune of 10 000 miles per day its a lot to handle
8685650 this year almost all the routes have changed because of the changes in our district
8685651 were going to a middle school concept where the 6th graders now go up to the middle school from the elementaries plus with the school closings that we had that means that most of the routes have changed
8685652 today the price of fuel is much much lower than it was just 3 months ago its come down thats going to help us
8685653 the last fuel purchase that we bought just a few weeks ago we saved 9 000 on that purchase so were going into the year prepared for the worst but hoping for the best
8685654 almost like tears of joys words cant even explain what if felt like because weve been working so hard and we felt like we just deserved it
8685655 there was a couple of times that we really doubted that we were gonna move on like when we were against fanny pak and supreme soul in the bottom two
8685656 it was really up in the air and we didnt go to that bottom two expecting to come out winning were just grateful that we actually made it through and here we are now
8685657 i think that now its gonna be taken a bit more seriously instead of being pushed to the background itll be propelled to the forefront
8685658 i feel like winning was a major stepping stone for b boys and even just dancers in general all over the world were not just the backgrounds anymore were in the front we have a name and we have an identity and were respected for our craft which is the way it should be
8685659 as a result the court waived his appearance for that hearing
8685660 i think right after that well be ready to get going
8685661 i wouldnt think so just the way it has been but who knows
8685662 once youre in the batting practice arena youre getting very close
8685663 hes got good command of his off speed stuff hes moved fairly quickly through our system and people have been real high on him
8685664 the warm up and the stretches are equally important just to prepare a child to get ready to play as it is to loosen muscles and ligaments
8685665 i roll my arms up and down in circles like in small and go to big
8685666 sometimes his arm has hurt and so we stop we shut him down
8685667 we err on the side of safety if any child remains with a limp or more important has pain in one spot where they got hurt that means theyre still injured they shouldnt play until that pain goes away
8685668 pulled muscles or contusions or scrapes and bruises and these will get better
8685669 we have injuries now that can be long lasting and affect the child forever
8685670 work them slowly let them have fun let them be kids
8685671 by far most companies are pursuing very limited footprints toe prints really instead of comprehensive ones
8685672 a company that is looking to move toward bio based materials may find it far more cost effective to encourage purchases of green power in its supply chain when they look at its total supply chain carbon footprint
8685673 this transaction together with others recently executed by the district represents further progress in infrastructure investment for the city it enables the city to continue diversifying its sources of financing for major projects it also helps the city depend less on the central government for resources and minimizes the number of guarantees and pledges against revenue that the city must establish to raise the funds it needs
8685674 the financing is also part of ifc and the world banks strategy to promote sustainable growth in colombia by supporting key infrastructure projects
8685675 it will help meet the growing needs for transportation in a city with more than 7 million residents and improve access and quality of public services to a larger number of people we hope to continue partnering with bogot to carry out more projects
8685676 a lot of people died for us to get to where we are today
8685677 forty five years ago it was unheard of you would never even think that you would get to this point so the point that hes getting to proves that changes are coming and that there is hope
8685678 i didnt think id see it during my time but i knew it was coming
8685679 i feel good with him because maybe he can transform the country
8685680 i didnt think it would come this soon i thought it would come im really glad its here now its really inspiring
8685681 i would equate it to just like going through the airport youre going to have the same screening thats there
8685682 we have to ensure a safe environment for all the denver citizens that are coming down
8685683 bring it on its all good not worried at all no
8685684 i do worry about children being abducted because it happens
8685685 i think the best choice is to protect them as long as you can
8685686 she and i do not see eye to eye on this
8685687 im pretty certain ive been called a hypocrite because of the way i was raised
8685688 it depends upon the child and it depends upon the neighborhood
8685689 one of the fears that parents expressed was that their children could be harmed or kidnapped
8685690 in fact more kids are hurt by the cars of parents driving other kids to school considerably more the percentage of kids who are nabbed on their way to school is minuscule
8685691 we havent encouraged them to walk alone at any specific age
8685692 some of the neighborhoods are not such that we recommend it
8685693 we never expect or encourage even 10 year olds to be riding their bikes alone
8685694 we have a number of parents who are also walking with our middle school students
8685695 long story short my son got home ecstatic with independence
8685696 long story longer and analyzed to boot half the people ive told this episode to now want to turn me in for child abuse as if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cell phone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids its not its debilitating for us and for them
8685697 i like him being independent and i like him to be a little confident and get places by himself

8685706 hes going to make a historic difference not just in our lives but in the lives of our children
8685707 i dont think that the nomination of sen obama or even the election in and of itself fulfills the dream but it gets us close it shows people can rise above race and judge people by their character
8685708 i think were going to remember what happened 45 years ago with the march on washington but more important talk about what we need to be doing going forward
8685709 obama has to show the american people that he understands the plight of middle class struggles and he must show them that he has policy ideas that make their lives better and that he has the ability to get it done
8685710 i just want him to re enforce everything he said i mean im already a believer im as supporter but i think her needs to bring those that are on the fence in
8685711 it gives us hope it gives us the opportunity to realize that weve come through the struggle in terms of the spirit of dr martin luther king but it was not in vain

8685714 eventually were going to see a tremendous amount of waste heat recovery applications but thats 5 to 10 years off
8685715 we have to get to that 10 percent efficiency threshold to start making it viable
8685716 the market is a lot of wasted energy and that is by definition a zero cost feedstock
8685717 if energy prices keep going up the economics keep getting better
8685718 clary said appliance maker bosch has shown interest in making a home heating unit with an attachment that makes electricity from exhaust heat at 10 percent efficiency a home could meet its power needs with the heat on

8685720 people should raise slogans against india and in favour of freedom and islam the arrest of our leaders will not dampen our spirits and resolve for liberation
8685721 indian authorities and in particular security forces to respect the right to freedom of assembly and expression and comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8685722 the use of force should be proportionate to the threat posed and firearms must only be used in dispersing a violent assembly to protect individuals against an imminent threat of death or serious injury
8685723 the acting high commissioner calls for thorough and independent investigations into all killings that have occurred so far
8685724 that the secretary general himself does not issue a statement should not be read as a sign that he is not aware of or concerned about the situation
8685725 leaders of the different protesting groups have a responsibility to ensure that demonstrations are peaceful and that the demonstrators are not carrying sticks guns or other weapons and refrain from intimidation
8685726 we regret that the ohchr has issued a statement on the situation in jammu amp kashmir this is uncalled for and irresponsible
8685727 india does not need any advice in respect of the protection and promotion of human rights of its citizens
8685728 it was our life long dream to visit our relatives in kashmir after decades w are the third generation kashmiris living across the divide but now we are united

8685737 kashmir is burning and people are dying and if people are interested in any thing that is news
8685738 we were just presenting the facts and reflecting public mood
8685739 it would have been inappropriate to run entertainment shows while denying our subscribers the news they needed most in these difficult times
8685740 it is for the first time in past two decades that local newspapers could not be published for such a long period
8685741 it appears the administration was deliberately acting in an arbitrary way to muzzle the freedom of press and keep people of the valley in dark about the happenings
8685742 the only source of information at the moment is state run doordarshan and radio which obviously tows the government line
8685743 our harvest is projected to begin in about two weeks

8685974 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8685975 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8685976 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8685977 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8685978 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8685979 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8685980 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8685997 can you pinpoint any specific statement by socrates that you think is the key here to the arguments failure
8685998 i dont know i just think this whole thing is stupid
8685999 it may be that i am misunderstanding things this would not be a first
8686000 this is what it feels like to be this close to me
8686001 i kissed my best friends mom on the mouth by accident once i initially felt very awkward but when i said oops we immediately both started laughing
8686002 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

8686006 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8686007 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8686008 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8686009 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8686011 if u know my question answer then reply otherwise pls no reply to me
8686012 id check out this whole urinal thing the etiquette of urinal peeing fascinates me can i look down at the dude next to me to compare do i have to stare straight ahead how does that work exactly if i was a dude i think every single time id walk into the bathroom and some guy was peeing in a urinal id feel like i walked in on them oops sorry didnt know someone was in here awkward
8686013 i would sit on the subway with my legs spread open taking up the entire seat i hate when men do that
8686014 i would have tons of sex i think sex is probably way better for dudes
8686015 i wouldnt want an actual d k but i would want to be a guy because then i could be powerful without seeming like im a bitch like i could be a d k
8686016 i would want to have sex with a woman but in the way that girls just different positions doggy style and stuff honestly i dont think i could have an orgasm in many of the positions that men can
8686017 i would pee standing up in public just because i could
8686018 you know how in the pamela anderson and tommy lee sex tape tommy put his penis between his legs like a woman i would do that just to freak people out
8686019 i would have sex with every woman i possibly could to see how it felt physically and to see how it felt emotionally to be a total man whore
8686020 masturbate a lot in the shower though because even as a guy sperm would gross me out
8686021 seriously i dont think i would be able to stop touching it i would just fondle myself all day
8686022 do i get balls too i think thats really the part that would be the most fun and fascinating and part of me would want to be kicked in the balls just to see why guys act like such wimps about it oh and i would definitely tea bag someone and take a picture
8686023 first i would pee in as many spots as possible outside then i would write my name with it
8686024 i would pee on peoples heads from a roof and then write my name in the snow
8686025 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

8686034 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8686035 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8686036 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8686037 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8686038 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8686039 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast

8686054 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary

8686083 theres a lot of rumor and speculation about the kindle one thing i can tell you for sure is that there will be no new version of the kindle this year a new version is possible sometime next year at the earliest
8686084 im happy its all over im very confident it is
8686085 i have some very good lawyers behind me if i need them
8686086 but i have also found that the candidate did breach an ousa elections rule by placing a number of posters and advertising materials on private property
8686087 i have however ruled that this was only a moderate breach and does not place the outcome of the election in doubt
8686088 ran an active campaign and at times did step over the line set by the rules
8686089 however she also engaged the student body and was a convincing winner ahead of the second placed candidate
8686090 i have no doubt that it was this engagement not any breaches of the rules which led to her victory
8686091 dogs have their place in a home usually at the head of the family
8686092 i had a feeling of shock then relief that someone with integrity had received it and had made the effort to pursue it rather than dump the document in the bin or didnt seek to abuse the information in any way
8686093 they were just like oh well just mail them back
8686094 i told them i was disgusted and its not like new world coupons you are handing out
8686095 i told them i would drop them back after contacting the people involved then she was very apologetic
8686096 from time to time we do make a mistake we understand that such mistakes can be very upsetting and we sincerely apologise to people who may be affected
8686097 i dont wish to make any further comment until i talk to mr peters
8686098 i have sufficient information that gives me reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8686099 i want to emphasise that it is entirely possible that there are innocent and honest explanations
8686100 it is possible that the investigation i have authorised might be broadened at some later time and those other matters inquired into as a result of whatever information comes to light in the course of the investigation about to commence
8686101 mr glenn on that occasion said to me pretty much what hes said in the letter to the privileges committee
8686102 as you would expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8686103 at every time this issue has arisen i have rung mr peters and asked for his word
8686104 in my view hes not fit to be our foreign minister
8686105 serious questions about political funding which go to the heart of the democratic process and government
8686106 i am prepared to wait on the court steps for them and if they dont turn up they can go away for ever
8686107 its been jolly hard to get this issue before the privileges committee and jolly hard to keep it active particularly when the committee is meeting at the speed of a glacier melting
8686108 michael cullen cant believe his luck labour will be able to blame national for not getting to the bottom of it maybe they dont want to know for a while i thought simon power was a labour party member

8686114 nzog couldnt have timed its production run better in a year highlighted by record sustained global oil prices
8686115 we are very relieved about it they said this was just what happened from time to time because of the sort of rock the bank is made of
8686116 its solid beneath there they the geologists assured us of that
8686117 it is great to be back on a river that challenges our skills as guides

8686123 there was to be a homosexual parade there on the monday that the katrina came
8686124 man arrested for posting guns n roses songs on web
8686125 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8686126 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8686127 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8686128 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8686129 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8686130 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8686131 a year ago i dont think anyone would have predicted minnesota could achieve a trifecta of fuel conservation increased use of mass transit and increased sales of cleaner burning alternative fuels in the middle of what has historically been the peak driving season
8686132 since vehicle exhaust is the single largest source of air pollution in minnesota the positive impact of these three elements coming together cant help but improve air quality this summer
8686133 the industry has been in slow decline for over a decade it is not something you can rejuvenate between breakfast and lunchtime
8686134 if any one of those initiatives are successful we should herald it because they are going in the same direction they are cherries on a tree of which we are trying to build the trunk
8686135 since then no one including exporters has maintained the good promotional work awareness and packaging that the fernmark brand had created
8686136 there has been a 17 increase in violent crime across the country this year
8686137 in queenstown there has been a 14 increase so we are near the top
8686138 that is not something we want to be top of
8686139 nz police committed to making queenstown a safer place to live
8686140 you are 8 5 times more likely to be the victim of a violent attack in licensed premises in queenstown than the rest of the country
8686141 let me get some things straight the queenstown police are totally unbiased on this issue we are not motivated by profit but merely seek to make queenstown a safer and better place to live
8686142 what is happening where and when it is happening and who is doing it
8686143 the only difference i can see is the amount of violence otherwise i dont believe it is any different from most towns and cities in new zealand
8686144 the council has been helping quite a bit but it also has to be the people
8686145 but i believe we do act responsibly there are victims we are not denying it but its an emotional issue too
8686146 there is so much politics egos power and games manship involved it is very difficult to know where we are sitting
8686147 we would rather be part of the new wool company or work with meat and wool new zealand but the reality is we have been going for 12 months and we have talked a lot to the wool industry network
8686148 the bottom line is you tell me how the new company is going to add value to a farmers bottom line it is all conjecture
8686149 there is no up side for anybody from what is happening at the moment
8686150 at first there were no markets in the world and no company in the world doing this work now people are taking notice of us
8686151 although we have some major expenditure in the new building development and ongoing work at our various properties we are in a very good position
8686152 the directors are still keen to establish further entertainment facilities at dunedin casino but need to get agreement from landlords and other interested parties
8686153 they may not then expect to have that top salary
8686154 grab the guitar and play along with top christian bands shred those riffs or blast the bass you add a unique sound to the solid christian rock
8686155 bush did a lot of bad stuff but the most enduring and damaging failure of his administration will be his approach to climate change
8686156 its only appropriate that barack obama would descend down from the heavens and spend a little time with us mere mortals when accepting the democratic nomination
8686157 we would have expected to read something like this in the onion fortunately for us its true unfortunately for obama its true
8686158 i really think it has a lot to do with the personality of the teacher
8686159 what matters more than anything is that its a good teacher and the teacher loves to teach

8686169 for the austrian political establishment many of whom were deeply implicated in the national socialist regime the argument was a simple one from 1938 to 1945 austria did not even exist thus austrians could not be held responsible for what happened to their jewish compatriots and only the germans were to blame for the holocaust

8686241 we are negotiating with a landlord in town and we want to stay in the centre
8686242 its been put to us arcade tenants that you put your quote in and the highest tenders get the outlets skyline said they would consider us and theyve been very fair
8686243 as tenants who have been there for eight or nine years we found the process frustrating
8686244 but this open ended auction doesnt appeal to us at all they are obviously trying to get the best tenders and i would too
8686245 weve consulted with the existing arcade tenants firstly and we did say if there was a national firm that was interested in selling a product like theirs we would come back and consult with them further
8686246 depending on how much surplus land were selling were expecting to get below the figure we budgeted for

8686261 the russians had been planning an invasion of his country for weeks even months ahead of time

8686285 creo que tendremos una gran noche estoy deseando veros all
8686286 se da a los republicanos una oportunidad de reiterar su mensaje de que el candidato dem crata es una celebridad narcisista
8686287 ya sabemos que es una estrella de rock ya sabemos que puede reunir a 85 000 personas en un estadio lo ha hecho muchas veces lo que tiene que hacer es hablar a la gente que a n no se ha decidido

8686299 youd think that such a disconnect between anti war base and pro interventionist leadership would cause a few brains to explode but the only people who seem to be hearing the dissonance in denver are journalists
8686300 there is no doubt that a guiding hand is needed
8686301 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8686302 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8686303 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8686304 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president

8686306 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge

8686314 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years hes been alert hes been steady
8686315 the late prime minister bhutto or her husband or it was a joint account
8686316 i think hes better than many of the others out there plus he was the husband of benazir bhutto who dreamed of a prosperous pakistan hell live out her dream or at least hell try
8686317 he may be an expert in darwinian politics but people perceive a sheer lack of leadership qualities
8686318 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8686319 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8686320 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8686321 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8686322 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8686323 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8686324 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8686325 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8686326 i think that in the last couple of years people are starting to be aware that if they have these units in their car people can keep track of you

8686333 no aceptan ni aceptar n ninguna de las condiciones que imponen los de santa martha porque no tienen ese derecho ni la raz n pues la tierra no se vende ni se negocia sino se defiende cuando sabemos que es de nosotros seg n las ley caxlana a los 5 a os obtienen derecho de posesi n pero nuestros compa eros y compa eras tienen derecho de posesi n hace cientos de a os y en la actualidad viven varias familias en el lugar

8686371 the real danger for the government is that with the 10p rebellion in which you kindly said i led the leading was merely putting on to the circuit an email and the response was automatic and overwhelming by
8686372 now the lesson the government ought to draw from that is that when it comes to protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our community while the government obviously shares backbenchers concerns about this they do now have a group of backbenchers who are prepared to take the government right to the line to ensure that a package is delivered

8686441 and if america is to be a great nation this must become true and so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new hampshire let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania
8686442 let freedom ring from the snow capped rockies of colorado let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california

8686447 the fact is that the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8686448 the governors refusal to seek subpoena power combined with the refusal of the witnesses to appear voluntarily deprives
8686449 to present governor granholm with duplicative testimony from him would be time consuming unwarranted and unnecessarily burdensome
8686450 although it would be a pleasure to appear before the governor samuel mccargo is confident that to testify again in this matter would be unduly repetitious
8686451 all that it does is change the form of the testimony
8686452 most of these people have already testified under oath with their own lawyers present
8686453 i think it will be a full fair and complete hearing of the evidence
8686454 council information material to its review and approval of the settlements
8686455 the resolution was to put on what evidence you have
8686456 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
8686457 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
8686458 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics
8686459 if john mccain does not carry colorado his path to the presidency just got harder
8686460 i see possibly a recession by the end of the year but it will be a relatively short recession and a relatively mild recession
8686461 some of the problems in the economy are a little more fundamental than consumption
8686462 the virus did not attempt any malicious or destructive operations the virus was never a threat to any of the computers that are used for command and control station and hasnt had any adverse effect on the station operations
8686463 this is really just a nuisance for us at this point
8686464 how it got there is really the question they should be asking themselves
8686465 if theres no direct internet access like theyre saying and theres no intranet access like theyre saying then it was probably transferred onto it either via a cd or stick or something like that
8686466 if i was them i would take this as a wake up call because it could have been a far more nasty piece of malware
8686467 the presence of any malware should be taken very seriously but it could have been a lot worse
8686468 more and more its simply unsafe surfing thats exposing users to malware these days
8686469 users really need to consider having those kinds of things disabled so you have to load them manually that way if that external device actually has a piece of malware on it the auto run functionality is disabled and it wont at least automatically copy itself over
8686470 thats a very good best practice for everybody to implement
8686471 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8686472 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8686473 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8686474 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8686475 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8686476 no other country on earth is my story even possible
8686477 that is the true genius of america a faith in the simple dreams of its people the insistence on small miracles
8686478 few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
8686479 together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth
8686480 you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8686481 you came together as democrats republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation we are one people and our time for change has come
8686482 you have to look at american culture and the fact that its been 400 years for these kind of racial attitudes to develop racial behaviors to materialize and youre certainly not going to wipe that out with just someone being elected to any office in the united states
8686483 i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
8686484 when we passed civil rights bills in 64 and 65 and under lyndon johnson racial attitudes didnt change for a long time but over time as a result of those bills they changed dramatically and in the same way martin luther king didnt change peoples attitudes immediately but over time he had an enormous impact
8686485 i know i made mistakes im sorry i regret letting you go i love you i will always love you
8686486 get your shit together or i will take them from you forever and i will bury you in legal bills and destroy you

8686491 francorchamps is subliem ik zou er het hele jaar door willen racen
8686492 dat zal toch een speciaal gevoel geven ik kijk er al naar uit
8686493 ik hoop gewoon dat ik nog wat rust krijg voor de meeting
8686494 ik wil gewoon mezelf blijven voor mij blijft het belangrijk dat ik me amuseer anders kan ik niet goed presteren
8686495 maar ik denk helemaal niet aan het geld het zou een mooie prestatie zijn maar het is niet hetzelfde als olympisch goud
8686496 in ons hoofd zijn we ook al een beetje legendes maar nu zullen we in maleisi ook echt als koningen behandeld worden

8686501 the jonas brothers are clearly the hottest act in the nation and this program makes dreams come true for some of our customers with the trip of a lifetime to atlantis
8686502 the first reaction from io was to sue rather than to work through the system
8686503 they didnt find out whether veoh worked to protect copyright which it appears they do relative to the digital millennium copyright act
8686504 what the supreme court said in the grokster and napster cases is that you have to look at the business model
8686505 the files on napster were something like 95 or 98 percent unauthorized copyright material that was illegally posted to the site there copyright owners in that case demonstrated that napster and grokster were both well aware of the piracy on their site there was no evidence that this was the case at veoh
8686506 youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement
8686507 id be hard pressed to say that the decision is a good precedent for viacom
8686508 i think it was a complete victory for veoh and for the 11 or so other user generated sites that have copyright cases pending the decision was pretty much a vindication for sites that comply with the dmca
8686509 very influential decision because its the first to rule specifically on user generated sites
8686510 there is nothing major to feel concerned about his personal secretary tenzin taklha said
8686511 for years we have been planting martyrs in our midst
8686512 its no secret your honor and im being very delicate with my no secret that the federal bench is not enamored with these cases
8686513 im a public servant and i have responsibility to address every type of case that comes in front of me and to address each case evenhandedly
8686514 weve made a great start and everybody at the club is feeling very positive
8686515 i always went out in lyon did my shopping there and my agent came from lyon too i was born in paris which is a big city like lyon i always felt myself to be more lyonnais than someone from saint etienne
8686516 lionel messi is one of the best players in the world but here its the team not the individual that counts
8686517 this is much more than a political campaign this has taken on the dimensions of the march in 1963

8686519 any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both
8686520 arent you so lucky to have me in your classroom this year
8686521 it was essentially a mistake that dog is a part of his life hubka is an animal lover himself
8686522 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8686523 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8686524 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8686525 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8686526 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8686527 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8686528 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8686529 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8686530 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8686531 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8686532 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8686533 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8686534 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8686535 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8686536 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8686537 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8686538 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8686539 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8686540 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8686541 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8686542 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8686543 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8686544 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8686545 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8686546 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8686547 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8686548 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8686549 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8686550 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8686551 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8686552 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8686553 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8686554 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south african president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8686555 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8686556 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8686557 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8686558 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8686559 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8686560 barack obama will put the security back in social security

8686563 manchester city can exclusively reveal that shaun wright phillips has rejoined the club
8686564 the fans favourite agreed personal terms after completing a medical this morning and joins on a four year contract following an undisclosed deal being reached with chelsea
8686565 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8686566 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8686567 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8686568 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8686569 the defender would very much have liked to have been in the squad but told the coach that he fallen significantly behind in training over the last two weeks and was not in a suitable condition for the start of the world cup qualifying
8686570 i just read about this guy and i found him to be a pretty interesting character
8686571 he seemed very outspoken and not too concerned about what people thought about him and was just really honest i really liked that plus i was fascinated with somebody that could be that obsessed with something to devote their life to it almost to a fault
8686572 there is nothing major to feel concerned about his personal secretary tenzin taklha said
8686573 theres going to be an onshore flow starting sometime sunday and lasting into monday
8686574 itll send cool moisture air ashore itll be like one big air conditioner and the marine layer will be thicker than usual
8686575 itll be quite a change from labor day last year when we had a heat wave the temperature in fullerton got up to 108 and it hit 99 at john wayne airport
8686576 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8686577 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8686578 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8686579 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8686580 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8686581 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8686625 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8686648 los empresarios dieron acabadas muestras de su compromiso ninguna industria en el mundo puede competir ante esta potencia sin el apoyo de sus estados

8686650 comenzaron a crecer m s aceleradamente alcanzando niveles record en 2007 desplazando a la producci n nacional
8686651 tres factores que tienen a desestabilizar la din mica virtuosa de la cadena textil
8686652 depreciaci n de la moneda y la importaci n sigue desplazando a sectores productivos nacionales de la cadena de valor
8686653 si bien el indec dice que la importaci n creci 6 por ciento hay n cleos productivos que no est n creciendo que se estancan que empiezan a decrecer que crecen y decrecen de forma vol til desde fines de 2007 y cae la rentabilidad
8686654 luego de la crisis del campo los niveles de rentabilidad llegaron a caer hasta 40 por ciento
8686655 sin embargo el contexto actual es muy distinto de los 90 hay solvencia financiara no est rota la cadena de pagos hay un proceso activo de reinversi n de actividades y en el frente macro se mantiene firme el super vit fiscal y comercial
8686656 estas cifras representan un incremento de 200 por ciento pero es a n m s alarmante porque ser 50 por ciento m s alto que en el tiempo de la convertibilidad

8686665 lo dem s es un ejercicio dial ctico medi tico que entretiene durante unos instantes pero que solo en eso ejercicio discursivo y ning n resultado yo me quedo con esta forma de construir y entender la pol tica y sobre todo la convicci n de que a la historia la construimos todos con hechos y obras
8686666 porque al pa s lo construyeron para el puerto y siempre tuvieron todo y a nosotros el pa s profundo siempre nos fue costando todo para lograr el desarrollo equilibrado del pa s
8686667 nos qued claro que la presidenta intenta evitar los lugares en los que sabe que est todo mal hay mucha bronca no s lo entre nosotros y los asamble stas sino tambi n con los docentes eso fue evidentemente lo que la decidi a no venir

8686672 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8686673 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8686674 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8686675 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8686676 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8686677 in the seattle area where rapid suburban growth has attracted a thriving crow population researchers have found that the birds can recognize individual human faces
8686678 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8686679 it is hard to be as nimble in a joint venture as it is within your own company because youre always engaged in discussion and negotiation
8686680 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8686681 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8686682 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8686683 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8686684 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8686685 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8686686 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8686687 no me interesa si ofrezco una determinada programaci n y luego la cambio para mostrar actos oficiales del presidente de la rep blica y del primer ministro eso es m s importante que cualquier otro espacio que ofrezca mi programaci n en consecuencia la programaci n cultural no es una prioridad porque puedo interrumpirla en cualquier momento para emitir sin previo aviso actos oficiales

8686691 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8686692 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8686693 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8686694 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8686696 if i knew then what i know now i would have never bid on that listing
8686697 about 90 000 victims have been evacuated from villages in the flood affected area by government rescue agencies
8686698 the commission has sent a letter advising the government to stop running such funds in the interest of keeping the image of the public administration intact
8686699 as a result many innocent officials get accused which is not desirable
8686700 this practice indirectly helps particular quarters in committing corruption and members playing main roles get the opportunity to be relieved of their responsibilities
8686701 the verdict will be considered as a shocking example in the nation we want a society where equal justice will be established and no one will be deprived but the verdict has frustrated us very much
8686702 the objections particularly on registration time will be solved through discussion with the political parties
8686703 bnp is a pro election party and wants to join the dialogue preceding the holding of the general election
8686704 not as bnp chairperson but as a mother i demand that tarique be immediately sent abroad for treatment
8686705 there is no work at my village at the moment prices of almost all food items have doubled in the last two years but my income decreased i cannot meet my daily needs with my low income i found no job in dhaka city so i have no option but to beg
8686706 i came to the city to find a job but the factory owners offered me very poor salary by which i would not be able to make my own ends meet leave alone supporting my family members so i started begging
8686707 i had been begging near the traffic signals during the last three years but i changed my begging profession and now selling lozenge this is more profitable as some people give money without taking lozenge or give double price
8686708 my husband deserted me with two kids when i narrate my miserable situation people buy chocolates and give extra money this way i am running my family
8686709 the basic idea is that we use three things the fluorocarbon a silicon based hydrogen source and a catalyst which mediates between the two to replace the fluorine in the fluorocarbon with hydrogen
8686710 the active part of the catalyst is a positively charged silicon compound that kicks off the reaction by ripping the fluorine out of the fluorocarbon bond

8686726 you often have fast food carry outs chinese mexican or other well known fast food restaurants seem to have more of a presence than a traditional grocery store or even a corner market in some cases
8686727 it doesnt make for an environment thats supportive of healthy eating
8686728 companies are constantly changing marketing strategies over social concerns about healthy eating
8686729 we dont see with the same frequency or fanfare in terms of targeted marketing to african americans and all were suggesting is there needs to be a more balanced approach to create a healthier food environment for african americans

8686754 todo apunta a que el sistema financiero espa ol es resistente a esta situaci n y que por tanto no ser uno de los nubarrones que veamos en el futuro
8686755 debemos acostumbrarnos a fijarnos en este momento de la econom a en el que efectivamente las cifras son muy din micas

8686780 viele in der eu nehmen schulterzuckend zur kenntnis dass moskau gerade dabei ist die europ ische landkarte neu zu zeichnen es will ganz offensichtlich wie einst die sowjetunion einen ring von vasallenstaaten um sich haben die nach seiner pfeife tanzen in russischen medien wird schon seit geraumer zeit gegen den prowestlichen ukrainischen pr sidenten juschtschenko agitiert zum gl ck ist der ukrainer kein amokl ufer wie der georgier saakaschwili der kopflos in eine russische falle l uft aber besonnenheit allein wird juschtschenko gegen den wieder erwachten imperialen appetit russlands nicht helfen und westliche solidarit tsbesuche allein werden das auch nicht wenn die eu schon keine gemeinsame haltung zu russland finden wird dann bringt sie vielleicht wenigstens eine gemeinsame strategie zur unterst tzung der ukraine zusammen
8686781 die ratifizierung des abkommens zwischen griechenland und moskau wird die gesamten beziehungen der eu zu russland betreffen der bau der geplanten nabucco pipeline wird von der eu unterst tzt denn die lieferungen von rohstoffen aus den staaten am kaspischen meer ber ein von russland unabh ngiges netz von gas pipelines sollte das gazprom monopol in europa beenden diese ver nderungen haben aber keine chance wenn man georgien aus der kette der staaten ausschlie t die beim rohstofftransit au erhalb von russland beteiligt sind das eben k nnte eines der ziele des russischen angriffs auf georgien gewesen sein wenn dies die russischen pl ne waren dann wird griechenland sie besiegeln indem es das gasabkommen zu diesem zeitpunkt ratifiziert athen beweist auch dass die reden von sanktionen die die eu russland wegen der anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit abchasiens und s dosssetiens auferlegen k nnte leere worte sind
8686782 dieser schritt wurde nicht unbedacht und unter voller abw gung der konsequenzen getan nach dem zusammenbruch des kommunismus fand sich russland mit dem verlust von 14 ehemaligen sowjetrepubliken ab die eigenst ndige staaten wurden obwohl dadurch rund 25 millionen russen in l ndern gestrandet waren die nicht mehr ihre eigenen waren k nnen sie sich vorstellen wie sich das abchasische volk gef hlt hat als ihre universit t in sochumi von der regierung in tiflis mit der begr ndung geschlossen wurde die abchasen h tten keine anst ndige eigene sprache geschichte oder kultur und ben tigten deshalb keine universit t wider die mahnungen russlands erkannten die l nder des westens unterdessen in aller eile die illegale unabh ngigkeitserkl rung des kosovo an wir haben stets gesagt dass es danach unm glich sein w rde den abchasen und osseten und dutzenden anderer gruppen in aller welt zu vermitteln dass was gut f r das kosovo sei nicht auch f r sie gut ist ich hoffe zutiefst dass das georgische volk dem wir historisch freundschaft und sympathie entgegenbringen eines tages die f hrer erhalten wird die es verdient denen ihr land wichtig ist und die beziehungen gegenseitigen respekts zu allen v lkern des kaukasus aufbauen

8686784 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8686785 until you hear from me again remember you are the sun i am the moon you are the words i am the tune forgive me
8686786 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
8686787 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
8686788 with humour and a tragicomic sense which belongs to art since the times of greek tragedy kippenberger faces his condition of suffering which he expresses in many works also for example in a video in which he crucifies himself
8686789 certainly the overall trend in the canadian labour market right now is fairly negative in the sense that a dramatic number of private sector jobs disappeared in the last month
8686790 and i think the sense is that things are likely going to get worse before they get better
8686791 theres a huge amount of variety within the service sector and unfortunately if you look at the past few labour force surveys a lot of the job creation has occurred in lower paying areas of the service sector
8686792 since the spring weve been essentially looking at a stalling out in hiring across canada reflecting a growing business concern over the u s slowdown and their sales prospects as well as high energy costs high material costs and the like
8686793 going forward we expect were probably going to still see continued or further softening in the job market into next year again reflecting a gradual slowdown in the north american economies
8686794 the manufacturing sector has historically been concentrated in ontario and quebec so any decline in the manufacturing sector sort of looms proportionally larger in those two provinces
8686795 every province has its day in the sun and in the near term i think the sun is going continue to shine on both western canada and to some extent some regions in atlantic canada where energy projects are important
8686796 theres nothing new about changes in the composition of the canadian workforce weve in the past seen huge shifts from farm work to other sources of employment weve had other industries come and go
8686797 flexibility in both the type of work you do and where you go to do it is the key to re deploying canadian workers who have been displaced
8686798 ultimately what needs to happen is more jobs need to be created
8686799 kind of like a shot going off like when youre blasting a little bit of rumbling no noise of course just a bit of vibration
8686800 we get a whole bunch of little ones all the time
8686801 it doesnt have any implication of other earthquakes on land or big ones
8686802 that whole area is where the two oceanic plates are moving and that drives magmatic activity and you do get swarms of earthquakes like that but there are other faults and features that could be responsible
8686803 were in a tsunami zone theres signs all over our harbour were quite aware of it

8686808 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8686809 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8686810 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
8686811 its a good step in righting the wrongs of the past
8686812 ambac and mbia are actually coming out of this not too badly the big two certainly had sufficient capital to cover all but the most dire situations
8686813 are still a scary situation which could still hit everyone hard
8686814 we think a conservative stance is prudent in the current environment
8686815 if execution continues on the current track eps may likely exceed guidance however for now we remain conservative as q3 u s comparisons are challenging and make continued mid single negative u s comps likely we look for u s comps to turn positive in q4 as comparisons ease
8686816 we were disappointed by the degree to which the macro economic environment deteriorated in the second quarter the impact of which was progressively declining comparable store sales throughout the quarter
8686817 to put this in perspective comparable store sales declined from negative 8 6 in may to negative 14 0 in july
8686818 particularly for the more discretionary segments of retail we think consumer sentiment remains shaky which as the holiday season looms on the horizon could lead to increased caution by wsm on 2h guidance
8686819 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8686820 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8686821 theres been a tremendous amount of site work for the new fields

8686913 caro julio em aten ao ao leitor que publicou uma nota no blue bus intitulada pa s do futuro nao uma boa marca nao remete ao presente aqui gostaria de responder acredito que a opiniao do leitor se deve a um preconceito bastante comum em rela ao expressao pa s do futuro e a um desconhecimento da id ia da utiliza ao disso como marca uma tima oportunidade para um esclarecimento
8686914 todos no brasil podem ter opinioes contr rias mas creio que no final desejam a mesma coisa pa s do futuro representa aquilo que queremos e pelo que trabalhamos nao importa que algumas dessas coisas ainda nao tenham sido plenamente realizadas a nossa decisao de seguir em frente e ir melhorando mesmo que o brasil logo venha a se tornar a maior pot ncia econ mica mundial continuaremos a ser o pa s do futuro pois esta a maneira como nos enxergamos

8686916 a diferen a em rela ao ao passado que nao estamos mais apenas em um momento de entusiasmo mas num processo s lido de crescimento sustentado entramos de fato numa fase em que o brasil conquista um novo patamar reconhecido no cen rio mundial a descoberta de grandes jazidas de petr leo o crescimento econ mico as exporta oes o potencial agr cola as solu oes para a energia os investimentos estrangeiros sao indicadores de que o brasil est passando a ocupar um novo lugar
8686917 pa s do futuro nao pretende criar ilusoes a respeito dos nossos problemas sociais mas engajar a sociedade no processo de consolida ao desse crescimento sustentado e quer promover o debate sobre os nossos problemas estruturais remanescentes no sentido de dar uma colabora ao efetiva para resolv los
8686918 para isso queremos promover primeiro uma campanha publicit ria de mbito nacional inspiradora para que todos possam participar desse movimento e tamb m deveremos promover debates e semin rios setoriais e tem ticos para discutir nossos desafios e apresentar solu oes capazes de nos ajudar a melhorar o brasil independentemente de qual for o governo ou do sugestionamento a que somos levados por crises conjunturais

8686922 there are many reasons listed for eating the placenta including it helping stem postpartum depression and it supposedly helps to contract the uterus after the birth we know that many animals eat their own placenta including as a means to hide the scent from predators in our modern world this may seem barbaric and some have even said that this could spread hiv aids or hepatitis while this is very true if people other than the mother consume the placenta normally it is only the mother partaking of the placenta in chinese medicine the placenta is known as a great life force and is highly respected in terms of its medicinal value however in this field it is not cook but rather usually dried to dry a placenta you would simply dehydrate it in the oven then using a mortar and pestle grind it up from there you can mix it with food or ingest it within capsules i have actually known one mother who did this drying technique it is my only personal experience with placentophagia no matter what you choose to do with your placenta remember to value the life it has helped you nurture and bring forth it is after all the tree of life

8687022 the results of the federations work to expand markets with the support of federal agriculture funding programs will have a direct impact on the canadian maple industrys development and we are happy to have initiated and to steer implementation of the strategic plan on behalf of all the players in the value chain
8687023 in late 2007 we commenced a strategic review of our operations and explored all options available to us with a goal to maximize shareholder value
8687024 this included analysing our existing lines of business exploring the feasibility of bringing in new lines of business such as voice over the internet and in addition we assessed various merger and acquisition opportunities we believe this process has allowed us to identify the best outcome for our company and all our shareholders which is the acceptance of the offer to acquire our company by globalive communications corp as we announced on july 23rd globalive is continuing with its due diligence review of the company and we are confident that definitive terms of the merger may be settled by the end of q3 2008 i would like to thank all shareholders for their support as we work through the due diligence phase with globalive and at the same time we will continue to refine and execute on the rest of our strategic direction to help ensure the value of our company is maintained
8687025 as we move into the third quarter our plan is to come out with new and innovative marketing programs aimed at retaining and adding new customers for our casual calling lines of business this should have the quickest positive impact on revenue

8687032 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game you need to ignore it and respond in a way that doesnt draw attention to yourself well just continue to work with jose about managing what he says and how he responds it is something we continue to manage

8687073 comme je lai dit auparavant notre gouvernement croit que lours blanc est un symbole iconique du canada
8687074 en clair nous devons nous assurer que lours blanc nest pas mis en p ril ou menac au canada

8687109 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore

8687111 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing

8687114 thats president bush hugging me see how tightly hes hugging me
8687115 im a veteran who has served my country and put my life on the line i believed my country would take care of me and my family
8687116 im not proud that my children see me staying in bed all day but i dont know what to do i just dont
8687117 this is home and i aint going to move into any slum just because fema tell me i have to
8687118 i just want my family to live in a decent home after all weve been through so we can rebuild our lives is that too much to ask
8687119 fema has closed 106 of its 111 group sites in louisiana renaissance village is one of them
8687120 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8687121 the need to complete important projects like the water plant has not diminished
8687122 we cant sit back and let others worry about the future
8687123 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8687124 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor
8687125 so goes the repetitive if ever deepening tragedy of our other war and under such headlines lie massive tragedies that seldom make the headlines anywhere ann jones who has spent much time as a humanitarian aid worker in afghanistan these last years and wrote a moving book kabul in winter on her experiences turns to one of those tragedies the fate of afghan women
8687126 during the past year a rash of reports on the situation of women in afghanistan has been issued by afghan governmental agencies and by foreign and local non governmental organizations ngos that claim a particular interest in womens rights or in afghanistan or both more reports are in the offing what has sparked them is the dire situation of women in the country the systematic violations of their human rights and the failure of concerned parties to achieve significant improvements by providing women with legal protections rooted in a capable honest and stable judiciary system education and employment opportunities safety from violence much of it savage and protection from hidebound customs originating in the conviction that women are the property of men

8687157 i talked to brandon before the news conference took place
8687158 i told him everything that i was going to say i told him exactly how i felt and how the team perceived the entire situation you only get so many chances in this league and brandon was running out of them it was time for him to step up and help the team help himself and be a professional and he understood that it was something that had to be done it wasnt ok he was hurting the team and he understood that
8687159 you have a better feel for the playbook for your teammates for coach shanahan you have a better feel for defenses you know where weak points are you know where to go with the ball our offensive line looks great its my third year with brandon marshall we have a great rhythm eddie royal has been a great addition everything is going really well
8687160 i havent had a left tackle like this guy since ive been here
8687161 i know it is out there it is what the expectations are when you are a first round quarterback going into your third year
8687162 people want you to be the player they drafted you to be its the year you are supposed to come into your own i hear it but i cant worry about it i just need to be on top of my game and study and do my job

8687166 when we travel to places whose people and cultures are far away from our comfort zone we have no option but to grow stretch and reach out
8687167 when we travel to places whose people and cultures are far away from our comfort zone we have no option but to grow stretch and reach out we learn that our assumptions and worldviews are often limited unintentionally biased and prejudiced and that we have incredible opportunities to become the people that we often dream about the gift of travel is one of the greatest gifts because it invites and entices all our senses to observe learn and become enriched

8687208 nothing leads us to believe that the departments actions were subject to outside interference
8687209 as i have said before our government believes that the polar bear is an iconic symbol of canada
8687210 clearly we need to ensure that the polar bear does not become endangered or threatened in canada
8687211 at the same time we have a constitutional duty to work with a number of groups like the inuit on protecting the polar bear we can also learn from traditional aboriginal and inuit knowledge thats why i am calling a national roundtable of key stakeholders by the end of november 2008 this will bring together environmental groups the inuit and first nations provinces and territories and other experts in one place to chart canadas course on protecting this majestic animal
8687212 cosewics work is vital to our understanding of the challenges ahead
8687213 their scientific work shows that while there are many encouraging signs for most sub populations there are others that need help the time to act is now
8687214 i also want to be clear that a previous government had the opportunity to take action to protect the polar bear in 2005
8687215 at that time cosewic made the same ruling that the bear was an issue of special concern however instead of taking action the minister did not want to have to make a decision and sent the matter back for three more years of study that was a failure of leadership one this government will not repeat

8687288 a new level of miniaturization of processors and radio modules encouraged the rise of a new kind of networks ad hoc wireless sensor networks measurement data is collected by distributed sensor nodes which interact separately and connect each other in a self organizing manner modern nodes for wireless sensor networks are built in a strongly modular way by providing open interfaces for integration of very different measuring sensors simple temperature and humidity sensors can be integrated as well as highprecision displacement and acceleration transducers tiltmeters geophysical and acoustic sensors or even gps modules for location determination

8687291 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour a striking example is the rhythm of the heart which is controlled by the interaction of several pacemaker cells each of which can be seen as a pulse oscillator even though individual oscillators are not particularly stable or reliable the heart as a whole is extremely stable and can readily adapt to changing conditions
8687292 in the winsoc approach sensor nodes communicate with their neighbours to arrive at a consensus on what has been sensed the network then finds the best path through the available nodes to relay this information to the control centre this biological principle is being tested in the landslide detection system a prototype network of geological sensors has been installed in the idduki rainforest of kerala india a region vulnerable to landslides in the monsoon season our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces barbarossa says the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre the network includes 12 geological sensors connected to 15 wireless sensor nodes spread over three hectares

8687295 the conflict in georgia cannot be separated from europes dangerous dependence on natural gas from russia in fact the conflict in georgia makes it all the more important for european leaders to act on energy security commitment to energy diversification including new pipelines circumventing russian soil is essential to the security of our european allies
8687296 europe must commit to construction of the critical nabucco gas pipeline nabucco is intended to be the final link connecting caspian energy resources with european consumers but it is being challenged by the russian backed alternatives numerous nato and eu member states have attempted to make the nabucco pipeline a reality i praise the interest in each of the countries that i have visited this week unfortunately their efforts have been stymied reluctant european governments must be convinced that alternative supplies are in their long term security interests failure to complete the nabucco pipeline would be significant blow to european security and challenge unity in the trans atlantic community
8687297 diversifying energy transit routes from central asia to europe is a critical initial step in formulating a credible trans atlantic energy security strategy that diversifies energy sources for all europe establishes a collective framework to work with russia and refuses to tolerate the use of energy as an instrument of coercion
8687298 the united states uses more energy than any other country
8687299 in my view the trans atlantic community now stands at a critical decision point that demands a collective energy security strategy two years ago at the nato summit in riga i encouraged the alliance to make energy security an article v commitment in which a member experiencing a deliberate energy disruption would receive assistance from other alliance members i argued that a natural gas shutdown experienced by a european country in the middle of winter could cause death and economic loss on the scale of a military attack such circumstances are made more dangerous by the prospects that nations might become desperate increasing the chances of armed conflict and terrorism
8687300 in the two years since the riga summit discussion of energy security has increased
8687301 the kremlin and gazprom have shut off energy supplies to six different countries during the last several years most recently to the czech republic these energy cutoffs were efforts at russian intimidation and demonstrate the willingness of russia to use its commanding energy export position to back its demands for foreign policy or economic policy concessions the events this month in georgia have not only focused attention on the need for energy diversification but also for european unity in discussing it

8687303 i look forward to the state fair every year its an opportunity for people around south dakota to come together for a few days with their family and friends it gives elected officials a chance to talk to constituents specifically about ag policy the farm bill and the future of our state as we will at the agriculture forum i look forward to meeting up with many south dakotans and hopefully ill get a chance to enjoy some fair food while im there too

8687337 republicans who favor allowing offshore drilling and exploration refused to give up the ghost theyve remained in washington and have been hammering away on drilling each weekday since the recess began theyve been trying to make the point that pelosi should allow open debate and a vote on the matter but theyve been talking without even the c span cameras having been turned on
8687338 we support a comprehensive energy policy that looks across the spectrum focusing on production and conservation on alternative and traditional fuels on today and tomorrow and 10 years down the road
8687339 americans get what pelosi doesnt more than three times as many americans support offshore drilling as approve of congress right now

8687446 the basic attitude behind the two conversions and changes in augustines life that is behind his turning to the word and later to the selfless service of others is what he himself once called his restlessness of heart he means thte attitude that will not let human beings be at peace with themselves and their present state but keeps them journeying toward the eternal reality in which alone they can find repose and fulfillment
8687447 my lovers of old trifles of trifles and vanities of vanities held me back

8687450 this was indeed the turning point in his life whatever historical explanation we give to the childs words take and read augustine truly made them a program for his life at this moment he really discovered the word of god and henceforth remained a hearer of the word constantly turning to it in order to gain light and direction for his life at this moment then he experienced in his own person the situation of decision the primal situation of adam in the garden and in this primal situation of adam in the garden of decision he found in gods word the tree of life that brought him the closeness to god and the communion with god which adam had lost because he had attempted by his own powers to become like god and actually divine

8687452 the faith is an orientation of our existence as a whole in its completeness
8687453 where the human being as a whole is at stake he surpasses himself an act of the complete i is always at the same time becoming open to others an act of being with and even more we cannot realize ourselves without touching our most profound foundation the living god who is present in the profundity of our existence and sustains it where the human being as a whole is at stake together with the i there is also present the we and the you of the totally other the you of god

8687455 on a visit to hippo the great seaport of north africa he entered the church and listened to the elderly bishop valerius preaching
8687456 it is precisely here that we see augustines greatness in the fact that out of obedience he accepted this new direction for his life and gave himself completely to the new task now laid upon him for from this moment forward there was no more time for tranquil study of the word and for the stillness of contemplation that he has chosen as his lot in life from early morning to late evening he was constantly up against the whole panorama of human life the doorbell of his house rang al day long and he had to reconcile enemies comfort mourners and do all the things that are a priests lot in addition according to the legal setup of the time he was judge in all the civil litigation of the town and was involved in all the human dealings of its citizens

8687624 tcu is a challenge to start the season its going to be a good test to see how far weve come

8687638 and what appears to be overlooked is the fact that the actor was still very combative at the hospital and it took eight staff members to restrain him his coma was not the direct result of being hit with the taser
8687639 he was in a seizure in my living room i didnt want the cops in my house if he wasnt having a seizure i could have handled it myself

8687657 certainly as we age there are declines with brain functions and cognition but theres evidence that the aging brain can adapt and change more than we ever thought

8687666 the study was based on tests of about 11 000 people in britain who were tested for hand control co ordination and clumsiness at age seven and 11 and were then followed until age 33

8687668 while it is often assumed that the cognitive impairments seen in adult obesity are a consequence of excess weight that could be putting the chicken before the egg the researchers say
8687669 the main message of cognitive therapy overall and its application in the diet world is straight forward problems losing weight are not ones fault problems simply reflect lack of skills skills that can be acquired and mastered through practice dieters who read the book or workbook learn a new cognitive or behavioral skill every day for six weeks they practice some skills just once they automatically incorporate others for their lifetime
8687670 that is exactly my goal to show how everyone can learn some critical skills the key ones are
8687671 1 how to motivate oneself the first task that dieters do is to write a list of the 15 of 20 reasons why they want to lose weight and read that list every single day
8687672 2 plan in advance and self monitor behavior a typical reason for diet failure is a strong preference for spontaneity i ask people to prepare a plan and then i teach them the skills to stick to it
8687673 3 overcome sabotaging thoughts dieters have hundreds and hundreds of thoughts that lead them to engage in unhelpful eating behavior i have dieters read cards that remind them of key points e g that it isnt worth the few moments of pleasure theyll get from eating something they hadnt planned and that theyll feel badly afterwards that they cant eat whatever they want whenever they want in whatever quantity they want and still be thinner that the scale is not supposed to go down every single day that they deserve credit for each helpful eating behavior they engage in to name just a few
8687674 4 tolerate hunger and craving overweight people often confuse the two you experience hunger when your stomach feels empty craving is an urge to eat usually experienced in the mouth or throat even if your stomach is full
8687675 you should walk off that mat with your soul gasping for air i walked off and i wasnt tired and if im not tired thats a problem wrestlers say that the most honest thing youll ever do after a match is go back to your room and look at yourself in the mirror i dont have to go that far to know this i dropped the ball today

8687678 theyre flying me out six days after the pulver fight to mexico city to do a press conference and to make a huge announcement
8687679 as i understand it both urijah and i are going i think both of us just need to hold up our ends of the bargain on sept 10
8687680 so yeah you essentially hit the nail on the head
8687681 if the way i have shown to lead to these things now seems very hard still it can be found and of course what is found so rarely must be hard for if salvation were at hand and could be found without great effort how could nearly everyone neglect it but all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare
8687682 delicious new confectionary uses cutting edge sensory substitution technology to transmit vivid emotive images into your minds eye
8687683 you can hear the enthusiasm when they tell you yeah im coming
8687684 it makes perfect sense when you think about who we are
8687685 we cant really sit here and be comfortable with hosting one event a year
8687686 while no policy can protect against every possibility we will continue to review our policies and procedures
8687687 i can only guess it was not a high level security holster
8687688 one of the things we do and i certainly hope the department of corrections would too is semiannual reviews on what to do when someone tries to take your gun
8687689 a hospital is a city within a city anything that can happen on main street usa can happen in a hospital
8687690 this is certainly an incident we would be concerned about
8687691 sometimes you dont really address things until something tragic happens
8687692 im sure its being addressed in hospitals all over the state today
8687693 real women dont look like that give me a break
8687694 we need to get ourselves in the chase that is goal no 1 to do that we need to have good finishes we need to run well we need to compete at a high level and we need to get the best finish that we can we certainly dont want to put ourselves in a situation that we didnt have to be in because i did something silly or we had a mechanical problem but at the same time you have to compete at a high level the competition is too tough so we are going to go out and try to win the race if we cant win the race then we are going to try to finish second if we cant finish second then we are going to try to finish third that is what we try to do every week
8687695 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
8687696 our partnership with adeq is yet another example of the uas goal of working to achieve a sustainable campus
8687697 managing the flow of waste at these large public events is made considerably easier by involving wildcat fans directly through education and community involvement
8687698 the recycling program has been a huge success among ua fans
8687699 a lot of items being thrown away at sporting events can be recycled this program is not only a great way to increase recycling at ua events it reminds people who attend the events of the benefits of recycling and helps them make recycling a part of everyday life
8687700 officers responded to a shooting call officers saw victim laying on the ground and his right leg bleeding victim stated he was shot by a black male suspect who attempted to rob him suspect was goa victim was transported to hcmc by ems

8687702 his long anticipated chess match with russias boris spassky was watched worldwide as if it were the super bowl except it was publicized as a cold war battle and drew a much bigger audience time out of mind the soviet chess dynasty had reigned
8687703 had the hundreds of thousands of connecticut residents affected been notified immediately that their data had been compromised they could have taken steps to protect themselves
8687704 nothing in the data we were given in may and june by bny mellon indicated in any way that these additional six million individuals and businesses were involved
8687705 the vast dimensions of this data breach affect not only hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses in connecticut but millions across our nation
8687706 the commercial providers arent there within a few seconds after the event
8687707 while wed all like to see the national public safety network this solution does not require that network
8687708 as a 2006 graduate he worlow was one of us
8687709 that plus it being the first day of school made access even easier for him
8687710 as i think back its really very scary im both extremely angry that something like this would occur but im also extremely grateful that nobody was hurt
8687711 were continuing our investigation and well see if that statement is true
8687712 spent a substantial amount with students and staff at the schools
8687713 behavior raised some red flags that caused people to start talking with each other and pretty soon somebody called our department
8687714 this was a very serious crime and we acted quickly to ensure the safety of the students and staff at the schools
8687715 through the cooperation with the staff at manchester we were able to promptly identify the person and make an arrest by 5 p m
8687716 he at least was here from the third grade on but i think he had all 13 years in the manchester schools
8687717 there were some minor inconsistencies that only a trained person would notice
8687718 but to the lay person who doesnt deal with this it is a deputy sheriffs uniform
8687719 this is definitely something that needs to be addressed so that a better level of security for the students and staff can be provided
8687720 weve always had a friendly atmosphere in the manchester school buildings but unfortunately im afraid things are going to have to change because of this
8687721 what the city has done in the past is provided the money to the homebuyer and they would actually go out and find a home themselves
8687722 but sometimes they had a difficult time finding a home to buy
8687723 now were taking a pro active approach to ensure that affordable housing is developed throughout the entire city
8687724 i want to express my appreciation for all the hard work that theyve been putting in taking care of the lower part of dyer and chamizal
8687725 i felt i had an obligation to the public to use every tool available to me to get to the truth of the matter
8687726 i still support it but i understand theres some people who dont and if they choose not to use it i think thats fine
8687727 but i just want it to be clear to the public because i think you owe them that that this contract is going to eliminate the polygraph
8687728 the united states supreme court says that polygraph examinations even a polygraph expert can only surmise can only offer opinions
8687729 there is no scientific there is no factual basis for anything that is given as part of a polygraph examination
8687730 when cap crimes against persons handles a homicide they dont allow witnesses to go home and rest
8687731 theyve just witnessed a murder their relative killed they dont get to go home and rest
8687732 theyre taken down to the cap office and they sit there for hours until cap gets statements
8687733 so its to the citys interest its to the officers interest its to everyones interest to ensure that the statement you get is the best statement that can be given that its useful
8687734 when you use deadly force against someone it is not a casual event that is an impactful thing that a lot of times makes people quit this job ive seen it several times in my career
8687735 chief wiles believed in it philosophically we are opposed on this and i respect him deeply but some of the things we have been talking about today are to guarantee both the rights of the officer and to make sure that we protect the city
8687736 the polygraph laid dormant for 20 years and the big question is why if its such a valid tool why
8687737 and yes the public does deserve the best that it can get from this department and the integrity of the officers that serve this city but that has never been an issue never
8687738 dont get comfortable mixed up with happy ok im not happy with it all but i am comfortable with it
8687739 the classica 3000 has the most panel options among three layer carriage house style doors
8687740 no other insulated carriage house style door in this price range offers a better combination of rigidity dent resistance and energy performance
8687741 many people in the garage door industry know that amarr pioneered the development of stamped steel carriage house garage doors and our classica collection has proved to be extremely popular among home builders and consumers
8687742 it is an honor for us to be recognized nationally by consumers digest for the high levels of design craftsmanship durability and value found in our classica doors
8687743 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
8687744 the ability of technology to improve efficiency is well known
8687745 but the u s has been slow to adopt an integrated electronic health record which would allow physicians and researchers to improve monitoring and treating all patients in urban as well as rural areas
8687746 oh really because his facebook page says hes enjoying the beach
8687747 there was something in the air that night the stars were bright
8687748 we are very pleased that alpine waste amp recycling is a finalist for the top company award

8687750 we are reviewing existing orders and inventories to address delivery commitments and maintain efficient operations during this curtailment
8687751 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8687752 del martin holds a place of honor in the pantheon of american civil rights leaders she was a hero and a role model to me and countless other lgbt women and men who seek nothing more and nothing less than full equality i offer my deep sympathies to her beloved wife phyllis and pledge to carry on the work that they began
8687753 del and phyllis were inspiration in action living openly and proudly as a loving couple long before many others felt safe to stand with them
8687754 del and phyllis have personally been an inspiration to me since i came out when i was 16 years old in my office a picture of the two of them looks over me as i work to carry on their work and their vision for living our lives in truth the national gay and lesbian task force will honor dels life by using our uncompromising voice and fighting for justice and equality a voice made louder and stronger by her 87 years of life thank you del for showing so many of us the way
8687755 its impossible to overstate dels importance in the struggle for lgbt rights and dignity when she and phyllis started daughters of bilitis they were nearly alone in joe mccarthys america del martin led the way for all of us who came later everything weve accomplished marriage rights anti discrimination protections in the workplace even the ability to visit our partners in the hospital owes a vast debt to her work and example
8687756 del martin and phyllis lyon have been an inspiration in my life and work for years in july i had the great honor of meeting phyllis and presenting her with a book containing more than 8 000 congratulatory wedding messages from people for the american way members
8687757 as a teenager reading lesbian woman between the stacks in the local library to one of millions touched by their journey to legal marriage i have long admired these formidable champions in the fight for equality it is a profound honor and privilege for in the life media to conclude our october season premiere episode with their recent wedding that episode now becomes a joyous tribute to her life her relationship with phyllis her witness and struggle for lgbt equality we are braver and stronger for having had her in our midst
8687758 judging by the seasonality of the menu lots of tomatoes corn baby veg etc most of these dishes wont be around for long the amuse as well as courses 2 6 8 9 13 and the pork and miso sausage in 11 were the most memorable and with a few ingredient tweaks should be available well into fall and winter
8687759 matt and andy have had their eye on setting up a pub for ages when the property came on the market they had to have it
8687760 i think hes really clever because every interview ive done in the last week has mentioned oasis so im answering questions about their new record and he ends up in everybodys interviews he is a publicity machine
8687761 before mccain can debate obama he needs to finish the debate with himself
8687762 lyon ist ein brocken florenz hat seinen reiz durch toni es wird eine sehr sehr spannende angelegenheit
8687763 eine gruppe die keiner untersch tzen sollte ein schmankerl f r luca toni und unsere fans
8687764 ich h tte lieber gegen eine gro e mannschaft wie chelsea manchester oder arsenal gespielt aber nicht gegen lyon aus eigener erfahrung wei ich dass die schwer zu schlagen sind
8687765 gegen lyon haben wir verloren und dann doch die uefa champions league gewonnen so kann es wieder kommen
8687766 wieder da angekommen wo er hingeh rt wir wollen jetzt richtig angreifen
8687767 nicht spektakul r aber interessant inter mailand ist eine gro e herausforderung mit der berraschung famagusta erleben unsere fans eine premiere auch das hat seinen reiz
8687768 ich w rde l gen wenn ich behaupten w rde dass wir diese aufgabe nicht l sen k nnen
8687769 insgesamt haben wir eine gruppe bekommen in der uns die m glichkeiten offen stehen ins achtelfinale einzuziehen aber wir kennen zwei mannschaften und wissen genau wie schwer wir uns gegen sie getan haben
8687770 wir haben in den ersten 20 minuten gut angefangen danach aber aufgeh rt fussball zu spielen vielleicht hatten wir schon die bayern im kopf
8687771 we have traced the hard drive and are currently retrieving it the purchaser is co operating with charnwood and has stated that the data has not been distributed to any other parties
8687772 we can confirm that an individual has been arrested and is assisting the police with their inquiries
8687773 as this is now a criminal investigation the council is unable to make any further comments at this stage we have also notified the information commissioner of this incident
8687774 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter we have worked vigorously to investigate the case
8687775 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8687776 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8687777 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8687778 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8687779 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try to help people who are hurt through this
8687780 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8687781 members have indicated clearly that they are not prepared to accept below inflation pay or a repeat of last years 10 month delay staff are feeling betrayed and management and the government need to act quickly in order to avoid embarrassing industrial action in acas
8687782 with the government losing the goodwill of the people who deliver the everyday things we take for granted there is a rapid need for it to rethink its approach to public sector pay
8687783 russian operation in south ossetia was very different in regard to american and sergey lavrov russias foreign affairs minister in an article published in american according to his words when the initiators of bombing campaign finished to attack the military targets it turns into the attacks on bridges television towers passenger trains civilian objects
8687784 it has applied force in keeping with the international law its own right to defense and the obligations which result from agreements related to conflict in south ossetia
8687785 russia could not allow that its peacekeepers quietly watch how right before their eyes it commits acts of genocide like bosnian city
8687786 russian envoy to nato dmitri rogozin compared the situation in georgia with the positions of powerful countries before the beginning of the first world war emphasizing that it is unavoidable that the relationships between russia and western countries would become colder
8687787 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe from 1914 when the powerful countries clashed because of one terrorist i hope that mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
8687788 when she spoke about o im here in the hall where following the nomination of barack obama the democrats senate candidates are being featured
8687789 the fact that i am on stage with t boone pickens just goes to show how absolutely dysfunctional our government has been
8687790 my main reason for wanting to do this is the transfer of wealth
8687791 in 10 years we wont have to worry about healthcare or education
8687792 we havent had a real energy policy in this country in 30 years
8687793 the last time a president came to office facing problems as big as ours was franklin delano roosevelt
8687794 the major differences between now and then though is that now the federal government is bankrupt the next president will have no money to borrow to retrofit our homes for energy efficiency we have no money to borrow to invest in alternative energy if we can retain a portion of that 700 million we export every year theres our money
8687795 im not going to talk about the character of the people im running against

8687960 through the elections to replace these four board members they can send a clear signal that the kind of behavior that has led to this ruling and the systems loss of accreditation will not be tolerated we can hope that this marks a new day for clayton county a time in which rebuilding can begin
8687961 i can only hope the remaining members of the board parents and teachers will treat the loss of accreditation as a wake up call to pull together and make substantive changes in the way this system is operated
8687962 even the states offer of help was met with resistance from the board we will now turn our focus to helping the system regain accreditation as quickly as possible

8688000 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
8688001 they will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with iraqs oil ministry
8688002 we have the utmost respect for ap this is not a hostile gesture by any means its the beginning of an assessment of our business model not the end
8688003 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8688004 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it

8688006 in manchester united we again welcome the european champions to celtic park
8688007 we remember the two epics we played two years ago and the dramatic circumstances of our win in glasgow
8688008 at this level its a formidable task to qualify but i think weve got a good chance
8688009 if we qualify three years running it would be a remarkable achievement and i do genuinely believe we have a chance to do that
8688010 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site
8688011 oh if youre at the writing stage then i can send you a copy of my thesis for formatting help and also youll want to know this about dealing with the paperwork
8688012 its a pleasure to be part of this magnificent group of players to win this award is great for me and i feel very proud the champions league is a great level and to be one of the best players in it is great
8688013 of course it was difficult because it was only up to me and the five players who would shoot but i tried to remember what i had seen from the videos id watched and what id talked about with other goalkeepers this is what was going through my mind
8688014 i was aware of fenerbah es reputation before i came
8688015 i know about the passionate fans and the great expectations at the club it is an advantage for me that luis aragon s is here along with spanish speaking players like daniel g iza and diego lugano
8688016 the new european club football season comes hot on the heels of a hugely successful european football championship where the spirit of both respect and fair play were seen both on and off the field id therefore like to take this opportunity to ask all the clubs players and officials to continue in that spirit for the season the respect campaign includes respecting opponents referees officials and supporters and will be prevalent across uefas european competitions
8688017 its a development of the fair play ethos which uefa has adopted in recent years and which is being developed on a broader scale
8688018 respect covers a whole range of things that football should be concerned about
8688019 we are developing specific focused initiatives to bring that campaign to life
8688020 we started just before euro and the message in the early stages seems to be getting through ive heard this from a number of sources and i saw it for myself that the issues of diving cheating and contesting refereeing decisions all the time were far far less prevalent during the uefa euro 2008 tournament than we have seen in the past of course what is important is that we take this through into our club competitions and see the same sort of behaviour from fans players coaches and officials in the next year
8688021 its like living in a cheesy 70s nightclub a perpetual cheesy 70s nightclub studio 54 with a cocaine addled dj who refuses to stop the checkerboard dance floor from pulsating
8688022 they rush right at you if youre near their hole they charge you theyre able to read you actually
8688023 to watch my back because i dont know what theyre gonna do
8688024 its very very annoying the squirrels cant get past that they decide its a bad place to raise their young
8688025 if you solve a problem that means your cash flow is gonna be diminished
8688026 were like the rodney dangerfields in the industry we get no respect

8688029 because the supreme court justices make precedent setting decisions that affect the lives of all floridians for generations to come
8688030 it is an honor to be appointed to such an important post
8688031 i am grateful to have the confidence and support of governor crist and i will work to uphold the florida constitution and our justice system
8688032 i am confident he will have the courage to make decisions that uphold our constitution and the justice that every floridian deserves
8688033 at face value and i admit i havent gone in depth it seems to be more about publicity and image than it is substance
8688034 its something ill look at very carefully if im elected to see if it has any actual benefit or it just creates publicity
8688035 weve been doing this over a year now in different parts of the state
8688036 we have citizens from all over the state that do this and we apprise them of what we are doing and what some of the burgeoning cons and scams are
8688037 theyre coming back and telling us what theyre hearing in their community and telling us how we can better use our resources to help them its an exchange of information to protect west virginia consumers
8688038 ill look at it for any benefits and if there is we can continue it
8688039 i dont think a lot of consumers are getting ripped off at the chili cook off
8688040 maybe thats a problem but i dont see that happening
8688041 they supposedly arent campaign items but they are passed out in the democrat political booth
8688042 thats a heck of a benefit if you dont have to pay for your materials but the state picks up the tab
8688043 personally i think we engage in too many court battles with companies about issues that would be better resolved if we sat down at the table with the company and talked about how to do things better
8688044 my style is to sit down and look across the table at somebody rather than to file the papers to see them in court
8688045 attorneys general need to be very very careful about hiring contingency counsel
8688046 there are limited places where it can be useful but i think it is incumbent on the attorney general to manage the fee structure very carefully and to ensure it is not a windfall
8688047 generally speaking if something is important enough to us well approach the legislature and budget for the in house attorneys
8688048 i am not sure i have ever used contingency counsel
8688049 there is certainly the appearance that the attorneys getting the contingency work are getting it based on political donation
8688050 when you compare the list of the attorneys who get the work with the list of attorneys who have donated to the incumbent attorney general it is remarkably similar
8688051 i dont think there is any question the role has changed over the last couple of decades certainly with the tobacco litigation being the primary example
8688052 thats all well and good joe that obama said that but what has he then make the point that obamas been running for president since before he was elected to the senate and has missed half or more of the last 100 votes
8688053 todays catechesis presents the life of saint paul the great missionary whom the church honours in a special way this year
8688054 in fact the celebration of the pauline year we are observing follows this chronology the year 2008 was chosen thinking of his birth more or less in the year 8
8688055 in any case paul was born in tarsus in cilicia a jew of the diaspora he spoke greek although having a name of latin origin derived by assonance from the hebrew original
8688056 paul seems to be situated therefore on the border of the various cultures roman greek hebrew and perhaps also because of this was disposed to fruitful universalopenness to a mediation between cultures to a true universality
8688057 to be understood probably as a laborer of coarse goats wool or linen fibers to make mats or tents
8688058 left tarsus and went to jerusalem to be educated at the feet of rabbi gamaliel the elder nephew of the great rabbi hillel according to the most rigid norms of pharisaism acquiring a great zeal for the mosaic torah
8688059 paul passed into history more as a christian what is more as an apostle than as a pharisee his apostolic activity is subdivided traditionally on the basis of three missionary journeys to which is added a fourth his journey to rome as a prisoner all are narrated by luke in the acts
8688060 in troas another important event took place in a dream paul saw a macedonian from the other side of the sea namely in europe who said come and help us
8688061 it was the future europe that requested the help and light of the gospel
8688062 in this brief account of pauls journeys suffice it to take into account how he dedicated himself to the proclamation of the gospel without sparing his energy and facing a series of grave trials of which he has left us an account in the second letter to the corinthians
8688063 we see a determination that is explained only by a soul truly fascinated by the light of the gospel enamored of christ a soul sustained by a profound conviction that it is necessary to take the light of christ to the world to proclaim the gospel to all
8688064 this i think is what stays with us from this brief account of st pauls journeys to see his passion for the gospel and thus intuit the grandeur the beauty and even more the deep need that all of us have of the gospel
8688065 let us pray so that the lord who made paul see his light and hear his word and touched his heart profoundly make us also see his light so that our hearts will also be touched by his word and so that we too will be able to give todays world which thirsts for it the light of the gospel and the truth of christ

8688067 obama is unintimidated by the rule against legislating about subjects one cannot define
8688068 m ingres painted the pontifical mass in the sistine chapel nothing more nothing less
8688069 fran ois marius granet a notably pious man conceived this subject in reaction to anticlericalism during napoleons occupation of rome the french authorities banished the capuchin order from the church of the immaculate conception near the piazza barberini even billeting troops there for a time nevertheless this painting of the churchs interior was purchased by the emperors sister caroline murat queen of naples for her brother louis bonaparte who had seen it exhibited in the painters studio where it created a sensation at the end of 1814 pius vii the same pope who had been forced to preside over napoleons coronation a decade earlier asked to meet the artist as a result of the exhibition granet went on to paint perhaps a dozen or more versions of this subject most on commission it is without doubt his most famous composition

8688127 account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership
8688128 what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8688129 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8688130 we have set a cultural programme for the madhi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mahdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
8688131 we want to transform as large a number as we can of mahdi army fighters into a social organisation
8688132 the resistance is for the professional fighters only that will be selected according to sadrs rules
8688133 two soldiers were injured in the clash in a firefight that lasted several minutes
8688134 the s c o states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetia issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8688135 i am sure that the united position of the s c o member states will have international resonance
8688136 it is well known who helped georgian authorities and even encouraged them in pursuit of their own mercenary aims
8688137 the active role of russia in assisting in peace and cooperation in the region
8688138 efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8688139 it would have been very important to have gotten direct support from these states which very closely work and depend on russia but moscow didnt get any support aside from general statements
8688140 our strategic assessment shows that if the zionist regime took action whether alone or with the united states in minimal time all of its territory would be vulnerable because this country lacks strategic depth and lies within the range of iranian missiles
8688141 irans ballistic capabilities are such that the zionist regime with all the means at its disposal has no way of countering them
8688142 in the event of an attack against iran the israelis know that with the capabilities that the islamic world and the shiite world have in the region they will suffer deadly strikes
8688143 our strategic assessment shows that if the zionist regime took action whether alone or with the united states in minimal time all of its territory would be vulnerable because this country lacks strategic depth and lies within the range of iranian missiles

8688145 we respect freedom and tolerance but the festival is a kind of provocation since it is taking place during ramadan
8688146 bosnia is a conservative society and i doubt that such an event would be accepted
8688147 a small group of people promoting ideas which do not represent basic values
8688148 weve been preparing the project for the past year and i would not spend my time only to provoke someone
8688149 bosnia and herzegovina is a traditional and patriarchic society in which different sexualities and or identities are not accepted
8688150 queer sarajevo festival will offer a space in which we will evoke and reexamine heteronormativity and patriarchic values
8688151 i see what you are saying but you can hit on the router within 4 tries home routers are located on 192 168 0 1 192 168 1 1 192 168 0 254 or 192 168 1 254 and this is the case with 99 9 if not 100 of all cases
8688152 the most malicious of all malicious things is to change the primary dns server that will effectively turn the router and the network it controls into a zombie which the attacker can take advantage of whenever they feel like it it is also possible to reset the admin credentials and create the sort of onion routing network all the bad guys want
8688153 that will effectively make all dns requests to go through their dns server so when you resolve google de which is usually 216 239 59 104 72 14 221 104 66 249 93 104 you will receive 86 154 244 15 which has nothing to do with google
8688154 a multicast ssdp packet is submitted to 239 255 255 250 1900 any device that listens on this multicast port will then respond with information about their service description if they are happy with the body of the discovery packet
8688155 internet gateway device igd standardized device control protocol v 1
8688156 the service is required if an ip connection is used for wan access
8688157 home routers are located on 192 168 0 1 192 168 1 1 192 168 0 254 or 192 168 1 254 and this is the case with 99 9 if not 100 of all cases
8688158 a health care policy adviser for the mccain campaign told a newspaper reporter that nobody in the united states is technically uninsured because everyone has access to hospital emergency rooms
8688159 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8688160 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8688161 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8688162 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today

8688166 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
8688167 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
8688168 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable

8688174 claro que foi um momento complicado porque toda a responsabilidade reca a sobre mim e sobre os cinco jogadores que iam rematar mas tentei lembrar me do que tinha visto nos v deos que t nhamos observado e do que tinha conversado com os outros guarda redes foi isso que me passou pela cabe a
8688175 perguntaram me h pouco tempo se alex ferguson o melhor da europa na minha opini o ele o melhor do mundo
8688176 quem consegue trabalhar durante 22 anos num clube como o manchester united com toda a press o inerente ao cargo tem de ter uma qualidade excepcional e ferguson possui essa qualidade tenho muito respeito por ele e pela sua equipa

8688181 um trof u prestigiante mas que permite aos jogadores desfrutarem do encontro o estilo de jogo ofensivo do zenit cativou muita gente na ltima poca pelo que espero que venha a ser um jogo emocionante e de ataque e creio que vai mesmo ser assim muitas pessoas consideram nos favoritos mas isso n o vai afectar a nossa prepara o para o desafio
8688182 na ltima vez que disput mos esta prova fiz alinhar uma equipa enfraquecida
8688183 quando vi a l zio a festejar disse que n o iria deixar que isso acontecesse outra vez eles celebraram como se tivessem conquistado o campeonato do mundo agora iremos apresentar uma equipa bastante mais forte
8688184 i am the showstopper the heartbreak kid shawn michaels pause cousin

8688186 thats fine but ive never lost sight of the prize the nwa world hvt championship

8688195 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8688196 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8688197 i remember when i was a kid watching wrestling i think jake the snake and rick rude had an angle for a whole year it literally lasted a year
8688198 oh my gosh we got a lot out of that one
8688199 it takes a while for people to get used to a new look a new image and a new mindset when they were getting used to it i changed it up into something completely new and different and not playing the old y2j character that was very sarcastic and over the top i wanted to take it all the way down to where if i talk slow and whisper almost the fans are going to have to shut up and listen to what i have to say because im in control im in control every night i go into that ring every night i say something do something or wrestle im the one that calls the shots not the fans
8688200 its the first time ive ever worn short tights in 18 years
8688201 what are you doing why are you wearing short tights
8688202 i think it was bruce pritchard or it might have even been vince asked me why have you been covering those legs for so long its a very homoerotic sport two half naked guys greased up and touching each other
8688203 i studied acting while i was gone and its come in so handy and made me so much more relevant now as a performer because im playing a character more than i ever have im definitely an actor playing the part of chris jericho when im out there it adds so much to the layering and the depth of the mindsets that i have i honestly feel that this is the best ive ever been on the mic and in the ring as well
8688204 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8688205 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8688206 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8688207 a nova poca das competi es europeias surge depois do enorme sucesso que foi o ltimo europeu de futebol onde o esp rito de respeito e fair play imperaram dentro e fora do campo
8688208 um desenvolvimento do lema do fair play que a uefa promoveu ao longo dos ltimos anos e que est ser alargado a uma escala ainda maior
8688209 o respeito abrange uma s rie de coisas que deviam preocupar o mundo do futebol o respeito pelos advers rios leis do jogo dirigentes e entre grupos de adeptos trata se de um valor que a uefa como organiza o e todos os seus funcion rios devem adoptar nas rela es com a totalidade dos seus parceiros
8688210 estamos a desenvolver iniciativas com objectivos espec ficos para dinamizar esta campanha
8688211 come mos pouco antes do europeu e parece que estamos a conseguir fazer passar a mensagem j v rias pessoas me disseram e tamb m constatei pessoalmente que durante o europeu de 2008 houve uma redu o consider vel do n mero de simula es jogadas ilegais e contesta o s equipas de arbitragem agora fundamental que isto tamb m se verifique nas nossas competi es de clubes onde esperamos ver durante a pr xima poca o mesmo tipo de comportamento por parte de adeptos jogadores treinadores e dirigentes
8688212 joguei nesse encontro de h nove anos e provavelmente n o sab amos de antem o a import ncia desse momento tiv ramos jogos para o campeonato na ter a feira que antecedeu o jogo e na segunda feira que se lhe seguiu que eram as prioridades mas desta vez tal n o se verifica pelo que n o h desculpas temos de chegar l e vencer uma ta a que muitos de n s ainda n o vencemos pelo que mais um incentivo
8688213 vencer a prova em qualquer poca sempre um grande desafio mas a forma como esta equipa est montada e com os jogadores que temos somos muito imprevis veis no modo como atacamos
8688214 analisando a poca passada essa a principal diferen a t nhamos muitos jogadores que podiam decidir os jogos no ataque
8688215 temos uma equipa jovem pelo que n o h raz es para que n o o possamos conseguir vencer a premier league e a champions league prepara nos para competi es como esta e estamos muito motivados a nossa inten o ganhar sempre e ter bom rendimento colectivo fizemo lo consistentemente nas ltimas duas pocas e agora teremos de o repetir esta temporada se continuarmos como at aqui n o h raz es para n o voltarmos a ser bem sucedidos

8688301 everybody has to do things exactly the same so its not those guys have to do things exactly how were being coached to do things dont change for me depending whos out there or what the situation is in the game or who youre with those guys have to be in the same spots as everyone else its just a matter of doing it i guess with those guys when you havent had the opportunity before
8688302 its a trust thing that they trust me to put the ball exactly where im supposed to and i trust them to be exactly where theyre supposed to be but its not an evaluation process like oh is he open whos out there or lets see how long it takes him to get it its this play to that coverage the ball goes there immediately he better be there and i better put it right there
8688303 yes its a building of a trust thing but trust is immediately there i trust them to do it exactly right and go from there
8688304 yes i dont look around in the huddle and see whos in the huddle and whos at what position thats not how offense works its based on what coverage we see the ball goes to a certain spot it doesnt matter there is no evaluation as far as did he win who is it that sort of thing thats coach martzs job and the offensive staffs job to put us in situations to do that thats how hell call the plays and do that sort of thing but as far as me im throwing it where it has to be it doesnt matter who it is
8688305 its very necessary weve been behind the eight ball there and thats hurt us we need that desperately that will affect us im concerned about it having my head in my hands a few days bryant johnsons been real good we need to get them in that environment as much as we can were behind the eight ball but to their credit theyve stayed with it they dont make any errors when theyve been out there they have not made mistakes so i feel good about that but just the connection between the quarterback and the receivers
8688306 its not so much of a chemistry issue as it is a trust issue if the receivers are all supposed to be 20 yards and theyre all 20 yards that makes the difference whether he runs the play just developing that trust and knowing that that guy is going to do what hes supposed to and that doesnt always happen that way so thats why some of those guys are out there in front and some of them arent because those guys who are not consistent you cant trust they just dont make it so were trying to get that group of guys that we can trust and be consistent and that the mindset that hes at my mindset is a little different from that because i need to see when you do the game plan you create things for these guys you want to see who can make a play make the most out of something and thats not where j t is hes just going to play his game my deal is all right arnaz what can you do with this or ok b j here you go what are you going to do with that kind of thing
8688307 its hard itll be hard thats whats scary but well move on with it its hard with josh morgan because hes a rookie the tempo of a regular season and preseason game is substantially different especially to play under that pressure all of a sudden if youre a rookie thats assured the timing not really like it was in the preseason because youre panicky theres that growth process for those guys that youve kind of got to fight through so to say that josh is the guy thats going to start excelling at stuff hes in obviously but were really kind of depending on b j to step up now and be healthy and ready to go

8688455 im so happy to get this award after all these years its such an honour
8688456 those years were a fun time it was hard at first being away from my home and my family but there was so much work to do on the farm there was no time to get homesick
8688457 we were doing a mans job so we had to work as hard as them we had to make sure there was enough food for the soldiers when they came home from war so we were doing all their jobs like ploughing planting vegetables and milking the cows
8688458 i really wanted to make a difference and help out
8688459 the question we should be asking is what alternative provisions will be made for local residents and businesses should the parking on shipping brow be removed
8688460 we have people carrying heavy paint cans wallpaper and the like
8688461 how far are they going to have to carry these things what about the elderly people who shop here we have little enough parking anyway without taking away what we have
8688462 there is a real buzz in the town now and a sense of anticipation its finally hit people what an enormous event this will be for the town
8688463 the real highlight is the fact its all free everybody has supported us so well and the whole community seems to have embraced the event
8688464 as developers we are over the moon this means that we can now put a stamp on workington as a venue for shopping and entertainment for the public
8688465 it should give people a friendly atmosphere and a smile it costs nothing and will give people a lasting impression of what the town has to offer
8688466 events like this will promote the town centre to a wider range of people and hopefully it will have a feel good factor that will last longer than the day itself
8688467 i think its great and i like to get involved in things like this because its very important we support the community we would love to have more of these events
8688468 hopefully it will generate more business and bring in a lot of people from outside
8688469 we are hoping that its going to put us on the map we want it to encourage people to stay in workington rather than go through to carlisle for their shopping

8688478 i believe the police have got to be basic and have a presence we have changed things from high levels of anti social behaviour
8688479 we tackled anti social behaviour on the main street that was the major problem there are now cctv cameras

8688518 its a nice change because you have a lot more freedom in high school youre there for the whole day with no free time now you go to class and get some time between classes the assignments seem to involve a lot more thinking which is a nice change that theyre more challenging you have to show up every day and perform im big into history and cultures so im looking forward to my world civilizations class
8688519 being up here in the summer helped me out a lot in learning the campus and getting oriented the first two days have gone pretty smoothly the people up here are great and have helped me out a lot the biggest difference from summer is theres so many more people here that has its pros and cons i get to meet a lot more people but now ive got to wait in lines to get food

8688548 we expect to see a quick and solid spike high within the next few weeks it may come as early as a few trading days from the date of this publication first we base this on the fact that the commitment of traders report in silver is showing us caution based upon countless previous experiences
8688549 march was one of the most volatile months for the precious metals ever experienced in modern history gold breached the 1 000 level and in a matter of days had fallen more than 100 silver moved above 21 per ounce and fell even harder hurting some folks who use leverage to trade these markets
8688550 this is the main point the fall is driven mainly because the price of precious metals is determined in a leveraged atmosphere as hedge funds panic and sell the commercial traders in the precious metals let out a huge sigh of relief as they are able to cover their short positions our sources indicate that many in the hedge fund community were urged to sell
8688551 last month we focused on the probability of the current corrective phase in the precious metals some are still of the opinion that the correction is almost over and we can expect to see silver and gold move toward their recent highs in short order we do not see that taking place and expect at least a three to six month corrective phase to develop
8688552 the market provided tons of information to comment upon this month but i want to keep it brief since much is available for free on the internet the cftc sent another message that they see no manipulation in the silver price i commented on this as did other silver commentators so if you missed it please check the main web site the thrust of my public article was that the amount of silver on paper is about 100 times the amount of physical silver and the silver derivatives are potentially a problem area in the future

8688607 but its not really a risk inherent in the single parent family per se you cant assume that every child raised by a single parent is going to have difficulties the majority dont
8688608 their concerns were driven by a lot of cultural assumptions which led them to propose kids are better off in the traditional family
8688609 the evidence on the whole hasnt supported that but the beliefs have persisted in society
8688610 those who grow up with single mothers with adequate socioeconomic resources tend to do well the children of poor single mothers are more at risk
8688611 many of the results that say that kids are at increased risk for negative outcomes have to do with economics
8688612 whats important is not whether they are raised by one or two parents its how good is the relationship with the parent how much support theyre getting from that parent and how harmonious is the environment
8688613 in the case of obama his mother was not particularly well off though she was well resourced intellectually and had been to college and had supportive parents
8688614 we see constantly children of single parent families who thrive because the parents are so devoted because theyre compensating for the absence of the other parent
8688615 that boys in particular need fathers in the way girls need mothers
8688616 i can tell you theres almost no evidence supporting that
8688617 for a variety of reasons children who grow up with single fathers for example are at higher risk than those who grow up with single mothers for either sex

8688630 thats obviously true given that the s amp p 500 financial companies have reported huge write offs over the past four quarters
8688631 actually this is only obviously true if we continue to ignore the losses that remain hidden in the so called level 3 assets of financial institutions
8688632 these numbers suggest that there may be plenty more kitchen sinks that will weigh on earnings for the large banks during the second half of this year
8688633 unbelievably these are tiny compared to level 2 and arent that much bigger than level 3
8688634 writing in the 8 15 issue of the washington independent charles morris observes
8688635 but these are the same class of instrument that merrill lynch recently cleared off its books for 22 cents on the dollar at a minimum freddie may be sitting on another 30 50 bn in losses freddie ended the half with only 13 bn in equity supporting 879 bn in assets
8688636 if a beam of sunlight hits those level 3 assets the walking corpse instantly shrivels into ashes
8688637 compare those level 3 assets as a percentage of tangible common equity which is a metric that measures how much equity is available to stockholders lehmans level 3 assets are 146 of its tangible common equity less than goldman where it is 162 but far more than merrill lynch whose recent fire sale of collateralized debt obligations cdos to lone star capital a dallas vulture fund at 22 cents on the dollar more like 6 cents because merrill loaned lone star 75 of the deal dropped its percentage down to just 48 morgan stanleys level 3 assets as a percentage of tangible common equity is pretty high 136 which shows that there is a lot more blood to be let in terms of getting risky assets off the books and into the market
8688638 in the second quarter wells fargos holdings of level three mortgages increased substantially but the banks write down on those mortgages looked small
8688639 wells fargos second quarter filing said that level three assets included collateralized debt obligations securities that have caused huge losses for several banks the bank didnt give the size of its cdo holdings or any changes in their value it didnt even mention cdos in its first quarter level three data other banks disclosures of cdos regularly contain such information
8688640 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need

8688648 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies

8688654 live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8688655 gave me a different perspective of the struggle i was in
8688656 it made me realize that i was part of something much bigger than what i thought before
8688657 there was a hole in the bus floor and there was a piece of cardboard on the floor that kept flapping up as we rode
8688658 when he said that someday well all be one it just stuck in my mind
8688659 this is the most important thing that ive done in my entire life
8688660 im on social security but i just thought im going even if it takes me 10 years to pay it back
8688661 when we leave there we are going to have to keep that energy going weve got to
8688662 i want him to be aware and to be here on this side of heaven and realize a black man being president because he shared with us that he had seen a black man hung
8688663 although i know a lot have suffered way more than we have its like having some kind of arriving
8688664 if we did it for one organization then wed have to do it for everybody
8688665 a problem can crop up in just one instant and you dont realize its there until its too late
8688666 those international standards can be sometimes more stringent than provincial or territorial requirements
8688667 i was truly fortunate to play as long as i did and i knew this was the time for me to wrap up my playing days
8688668 a great opportunity to become an assistant coach was presented to me by the stars and i look forward to making that transition and learning a new part of the game
8688669 we congratulate stu on an outstanding playing career and we are very excited that he will now join our coaching staff
8688670 stu was a consummate professional on and off the ice throughout his career and was the type of player who always exhibited the qualities you would associate with a future coach stu will be an excellent addition to our staff which we feel is among the best in the league
8688671 im not sure if i ever had coaching qualities as a player i just feel like you are who you are
8688672 i went out and played the best i could every night and tried to learn all the time in every situation i was pretty fortunate to play as long as i did and learn from all the great people and i look forward to passing some of that along in this new role
8688673 ive definitely thought for a while now that i wanted to stay in the game in some way once i retired
8688674 i had some conversations that something like this might be a possibility once last season ended and i took some time this summer to mull it over the stars organization is a class act all the way and i have the utmost respect for dave tippett rick wilson and mark lamb so ill be really fortunate to learn the ropes from them
8688675 anytime you are an older player you try and go out of your way to help the younger guy
8688676 i already have a relationship with the younger guys in the room and thatll certainly help going forward there will definitely be some challenges but this is a great group of guys and a super bunch of players so i will help out wherever i can to help our team win
8688677 rick wilson has played a major role in building the stars franchise into the perennial contender that it is today
8688678 we believe mark lamb is one of the top young assistants in the game and a major asset to our organization
8688679 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8688680 i dont believe anyone ever gets healthy because people are mean to them
8688681 these are not bad people becoming good but sick people becoming well
8688682 what other life threatening disease do we treat by sending people to folding chairs in a church basement
8688683 i want this to be the best experience of our clients lives but dont ever confuse nice with easy
8688684 the horse is a wonderful teacher because there is no agenda it is not our spouse boss or parents if we cant get the horse to do what wed like then maybe the communication problem lies with us
8688685 i went from a couple drinks a night to a couple bottles
8688686 i told him cirque saved my life he told me it was the best money he ever spent
8688687 look the work is really draining so if at the end of the day you are surrounded by beauty or you can lay your head down on a really comfortable bed it makes everything just a little bit easier
8688688 so were in a situation where mom and pop non profits have to do outcomes measurement while the hugely profitable private programs do not
8688689 if you take someone who shoots up every day cant function or hold a job and they slip once or twice would you call that treatment a success i would
8688690 if you are desperate and the first person you run into says boot camp saved their loved one then the next call youre going to make is to a boot camp
8688691 i think i could get better information than most people and i was completely baffled
8688692 if i had one of these bassinets and one of my grandchildren was sleeping in it i would make sure my adult kids knew not to use it
8688693 the only thing that was holding her up was her head
8688694 we do not want this to happen to another family
8688695 the night this happened we immediately came home and said my god
8688696 thats when we found the other family in southern missouri
8688697 hanging partially out of the bassinet and partially inside the bassinet with her legs dangling from the bassinet and her head and arms inside the bassinet
8688698 the investigation of a babys death in october 2007 remains open because there are still questions surrounding the circumstances of that babys death
8688699 we all felt it was the crib that caused the passing
8688700 the home was clean the baby was well cared for
8688701 i felt it should never have been allowed on the market i hate that another child passed because of this problem
8688702 im at a loss on why it took so long
8688703 after the death of his mother his life to a large measure took a very different turn
8688704 he had to look after all of the family and become a surrogate parent he started drinking then moved on to cocaine
8688705 it was only when he got arrested for this that he realised it was out of control his expenditure for his cocaine use and a high bill for the funeral account were causing him difficulty
8688706 mad skillz we haz them the vision mindset vs the process
8688707 darrrrling how absolutely sweet of you to name the food
8688708 i honestly didnt think i had a chance dont get me wrong i wanted to do good to do everyone proud to at least look decent on youtube
8688709 i am unwilling to even imagine seeing myself as a good person because
8688710 when i feel bad about myself it is because people are treating me like i dont matter when i feel good it is because they are treating me like im special
8688711 what should she do when people arent being mean to her
8688712 if you get depressed you dont have to do anything
8688713 if you get depressed you can just sit around and you dont have to do anything
8688714 this project uses bartering to create community exchange the purpose of bartering in this instance is to subvert both its semantic value and the traditional context of the art object as mercantile in nature this project places the object in a social interstice basically removed from the law of profit by emphasizing the sociability of the object in the context of bartering

8688718 drivers are using it as a cut through between livingston street and tappan road especially during rush hour
8688719 one of the actions we took was placing more police cars in the area but they want more than that
8688720 highland avenue just like all side streets between two county roads is a cut through street
8688721 people use it to avoid further traffic and lights and its been like that for 50 years it has become a busier roadway as time goes on because of volume there are more cars on the road
8688722 the state does not allow us to use stop signs as speed bumps and its hard to place speed bumps down on this one road when i can name 20 other streets that also have complaints about speed
8688723 if worse came to worst and the council still wanted to do something more we could try to utilize the speed bumps that detach in the winter
8688724 then the dpw wouldnt have to worry about plowing over them
8688725 we are waiting for their professional expertise before any more decisions are made

8688734 i think this partnership is important we all recognize theres a problem and were all seeking solutions to fix it
8688735 its not that the arboretum expects to stop getting water from the outside but we want to be able to manage what comes to us in a much more controlled way
8688736 the arboretum is very cognizant that it has a limited parcel of property with a unique research and teaching mission which means theres a reluctance to trade land for detention ponds if thats all theyre going to be
8688737 so weve tried to meld those missions with what would be considered contemporary stormwater management construction
8688738 these are all great questions that need to be asked because urban runoff is becoming more and more of an issue around the country
8688739 so the research that the arboretum does in conjunction with these projects is going to be used quite widely im sure
8688740 after the existing problems are fixed the question is what can we do in the surrounding watershed and community to reduce the impact of stormwater
8688741 because in 15 or 20 years when these stormwater facilities need to be rehabilitated again we want to be looking not at a worse situation than we have now but a better one
8688742 weve lost revenue from a lot of sources and we had to make it up by nickel and diming from other things

8688829 i was an old bluegrass lover listner not player from college and went to beanblossom in the with like minded people i saw the stanley brothers at a club a couple of weeks before carter died and filmed at beanblossom in 1968 69 and 70 when i moved to nyc i saw monroe at the 23rd st ymca as i lived on 22nd st a block away when i returned to ohio my deep interest caused me to write the nea for an american masters grant for a monroe documentary then i met larry nager and with his writing i got the grant and a bunch of others that enabled us to make the film the fact is that doing a project like this takes more than grants ever provide i worked as an architect all through this period to pay my bills and allow me to do the film larry nager wrote for the afternoon newspaper to earn his keep it took 3 years to do this project
8688830 we were not able to release it to theaters because one of the early cameramen shot his footage at 30fps frames per second while the others shot at 24fps that alone prevented a simple blow up to 35mm however my ambition was to make this for television and home video which we did my interest was in propaganda reaching a larger audience for monroe through his crossover influences like jerry garcia paul mccartney emmylou harris etc the original source was 16mm ecn film which was transferred to d2 digital format and cut on an avid suite 3rd avid out there in 1990 this was one of the first battles of the digital age the audio was recorded on multi track at beanblossom twice at the grand ole opry in nashville and at frontier ranch near columbus oh as well as other performance locations and in stereo by geoff maxwell from cincinnati geoff mixed all the audio

8688923 i have never understood how putting a building underground is cheaper than putting a building aboveground
8688924 all other things being equal it may be more expensive to have the plant underground than at the surface level but it wasnt all other things being equal the length of tunneling that was required at the respective sites was a significant factor

8688978 i congratulate tesco on their decision to withdraw from the eco towns process following our joint discussions with them
8688979 we are very pleased that they now accept that the best way to proceed with planning for new developments in the district is through the existing planning mechanism of the regional spatial strategy
8688980 together with our partner authorities and horizons and alongside people from the area weve worked hard to demonstrate the very real and tangible reasons why the eco town proposal was a bad idea todays announcement is good news for us all
8688981 this is excellent news and follows on from our talks with tesco where they were left in no doubt about our feelings on hanley grange being promoted through the eco towns process
8688982 we have worked together to fight this proposal all the way and i thank tesco for agreeing to now go through the proper planning process if they want to take this forward
8688983 we have always argued the eco town process was flawed and ignored the correct procedures
8688984 we have consistently objected to the eco towns process arguing instead that new developments beyond those already planned should come forward through the review of the regional spatial strategy rss
8688985 i am delighted that tesco have listened to those concerns and withdrawn hanley grange from the eco towns process they will of course still be able to present any proposals through the proper planning processes
8688986 the whole point of developing a long list of potential locations was to get down to a shorter final list and we remain committed to announcing this final shortlist of up to ten potential locations early in the new year
8688987 there remains a serious shortage of housing in the cambridge area with almost 10 000 families on the waiting list for affordable housing and this is an issue that must be resolved
8688988 we have been clear that only proposals of the highest standards stand a chance of becoming an eco town
8688989 the promoters have decided they need more time to develop their proposal and we would expect it to be considered as part of the planned review of the regional spatial strategy
8688990 eco towns started off as an idea that sounded good but labours incompetent handling of the project has led to wide scale distrust amongst the public and developers alike
8688991 now even those who are behind the applications have decided that it is better to go it alone and forget the government sponsored eco con scheme

8689357 you could have the equivalent of las vegas if your government wants to invite us there we would be happy to commit 12 14 billion us dollars
8689358 we would like to build a cotai strip in india that would not affect macau whatsoever as a matter of fact the market in india with 1 1 billion people would justify more than one cotai strip
8689359 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8689360 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8689361 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8689371 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare

8689382 i swear i was going to hit him i wanted to hit him i had to walk away at that point are you ready to order
8689383 so first of all hes morally opposed to hunting for food but hes in a diner
8689384 oh yeah hes going on and on about how hes a vegan and im thinking i didnt say it those french fries youre eating were fried in the same oil as the scallops the chicken and i was like haha i win

8689400 hitting moving targets has always been very very difficult and i would say that its not until recent years that weve been able to truly have technology that allows us to do that with a pretty good degree of certainty
8689401 one of the things we noticed here is how many targets that we didnt hit because we didnt have a weapon that was designed to go after a mover

8689409 but flexible project management is not a left brain black and white endeavor
8689410 it requires the full brain and touches on all shades of gray requiring understanding and exercise of adaptive leadership versus command and control

8689650 roberts was in a position of trust and his actions have had devastating consequences for the charities and people involved
8689651 he was regarded as a family friend by two of the victims which has made his deceit even harder for them to bear
8689652 roberts not only used the cash he had stolen to pay his business debts he also used it to fund his own lifestyle owning two properties and putting his children through university

8689660 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8689661 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8689662 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

8689691 however we believe this is only the end of the beginning of a journey into the future that will see our industry delivering the infrastructure to south africa and transforming into an entity of which all of us our government and south africa can be proud
8689692 its important that government and clients alike support and use it because its all we have
8689693 as we have indicated previously africa and the middle east and possibly further east is the most logical sort of expansion area for us
8689694 you also have to take into consideration that south and central america is already dominated by some fairly large players which is not true for south east asia
8689695 we thought that making a foray into india made sense because tariffs are low but penetration is also fairly low

8689700 you dont have to be a pagan to win my vote in fact id advise you not to be a pagan if you want to win an election hmmn perhaps we dont make enough use of unpopular religions since theres a widespread internet lie that obama is really a muslim perhaps we should counter with the rumor that mccain was seen dancing naked in the moonlight wearing goats horns really its true ive seen it myself okay it was a vision and what a vision i had to dose myself with ibuprofen and valerian tea afterwards to recover but my visions are rarely false

8689708 so the operations can already place orders for that capex to ensure that our rollout in the first quarter next year just continues as it will for the last two quarters of this year so we dont have any hiccup in the rollout
8689709 to get that r25 billion of infrastructure in the ground there is still quite a lot of work to be done in the next five months
8689710 we are in the process of laying out i think its about 200 km in the gauteng region of fibre optic and then obviously the same in the durban metropolitan area cape town and so on hopefully there can be far more constructive assessment of how that infrastructure can be laid out without digging up all the streets and having everybody complaining about that
8689711 significant quality of service improvements should assist in resolving the advertising ban still in place

8689889 of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end he will reign on davids throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever
8689890 then to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom the one which shall not be destroyed
8689891 to him who overcomes i will grant to sit with me on my throne
8689892 he who overcomes and keeps my works until the end to him i will give power over the nations
8689893 whoever desires to become great among you let him be your servant and whoever desires to be first among you let him be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many

8689896 it seemed to me that benjamin franklin was wiser than washington alexander hamilton was more brilliant john adams was better read thomas jefferson was more intellectually sophisticated james madison was more politically astute
8689897 within the gallery of greats so often mythologized and capitalized as founding fathers washington was recognized as primus inter pares the foundingest father of them all why was that i have looked for an answer which lies buried within the folds of the most ambitious determined and potent personality of an age not lacking for worthy rivals
8689898 with braddock down and the other aides de camp casualties it fell to washington to rally the remnants
8689899 his specialty seemed to be exhibiting courage in lost causes or as one newspaper account put it he had earned a high reputation for military skill integrity and valor tho success has not always attended his undertakings there was even talk it was the first occasion that his remarkable capacity to endure marked him as a man of destiny
8689900 that heroic youth col washington who i cannot but hope providence has hitherto preserved in so signal a manner for some important service to his country
8689901 the feeling was that if he george washington who had so much was willing to risk his all however daunting the odds then who were they to equivocate that he was also serving without pay was widely taken as further evidence of the genuineness of his commitment
8689902 first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen
8689903 in order to comprehend modern leadership theory and be successful in the future leaders must look to the past to president abraham lincoln for example who routinely practiced nearly all of the revolutionary thinking techniques that have been preached to american industry in the last ten to fifteen years
8689904 lincoln can be looked to as the ideal model for desirable effective leadership he is the perfect example of a transforming leader a person who aims for the evolution of a new level of awareness and understanding among all members of an organization such a leader rejects the use of naked power and instead attempts to motivate and mobilize followers by persuading them to take ownership of their roles in a more grand mission that is shared by all members of the organization
8689905 get out of the office and circulate among the troops
8689906 his cardinal mistake is that he isolates himself and allows nobody to see him and by which he does not know what is going on in the very matter he is dealing with
8689907 freemont was completely out of touch with those he commanded and the situation at hand
8689908 lincoln revealed the cornerstone of his own personal leadership philosophy an approach that would become part of a revolution in modern leadership thinking 100 years later when it was dubbed mbwa managing by wandering around by tom peters and robert waterman in their 1982 book in search of excellence
8689909 so whats the lesson to be learned from this episode
8689910 had he dictated to them they may have accepted his authority with great resentment but the problem would not have gone away it would have lingered and festered by gathering the disputing parties lincoln let his subordinates lead themselves out of the mess
8689911 an important man left the white house in washington for the war office with a letter from the president to the secretary of war edwin stanton in a very few minutes he was back in the white house again bursting with indignation
8689912 the president looked up in mild surprise did you give the message to stanton he asked
8689913 he tore it up exclaimed the outraged citizen and whats more sir he said you are a fool
8689914 the president rose slowly from the desk stretching his long frame to its full height and regarding the wrath of the other with a quizzical glance
8689915 well said the president with a dry laugh i reckon it must be true then because stanton is generally right
8689916 the angry gentleman waited for the storm to break but nothing happened abraham lincoln turned quietly to his desk and went on with his work
8689917 there lies the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen
8689918 we shall not flag or fail we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender
8689919 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and those who are great exercise authority over them yet it shall not be so among you but whoever desires to become great among you let him be your servant and whoever desires to be first among you let him be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
8689920 for my thoughts are not your thoughts nor are your ways my ways says the lord
8689921 who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
8689922 and one of them goes astray does he not leave the ninety nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying and if he should find it assuredly i say to you he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety nine that did not go astray even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
8689923 father forgive them for they do not know what they do
8689924 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness
8689925 therefore god exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
8689926 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
8689927 for to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end he will reign on davids throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever the zeal of the lord almighty will accomplish this
8689928 the spirit of the lord will rest on him the spirit of wisdom and of understanding the spirit of counsel and of power the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord and he will delight in the fear of the lord

8689930 the wolf will live with the lamb the leopard will lie down with the goat the calf and the lion and the yearling together and a little child will lead them they will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea

8689933 it made me happy to see how she defended the union for the mediterranean that was really the german french axis
8689934 we shall have another roman empire and imperialist design these are imperialist maps and designs that we have already rolled up we should not have them again
8689935 i believe this project of the union for the mediterranean would increase illegal migration and terrorism and give a justification to islamist extremists to step up jihad attacks these extremists would explain it the mediterranean union as a crusade against islam and european colonisation
8689936 they will talk about jihad in europe this project is frightening this project is dangerous they will interpret it as a new crusade to contain muslim forces they will see it as a new colonialism and they will accuse the arabs i e the arab leaders that they are traitors who have abandoned principles and sold out their countries
8689937 the deployment of new antimissile forces has as its aim the russian federation
8689938 vladimir putin the russian prime minister warned victor yushchenko ukraines reformist president last february that russia could point nuclear missiles at ukraine if it co operated with us missile plans ukraine is insisting that the russian military must leave sebastopol when the lease on the base expires in 2017 the russian navy has made it clear that it may refuse to do so
8689939 if the west was surprised by the ferocity of russia s action in georgia the struggle over ukraine will be far more intense many russians regard their western neighbour as part of their homeland a view shared by many russian speaking ukrainians any outbreak of violence could have huge repercussions
8689940 moscow has unleashed a cyberwar against tiny estonia formerly a soviet republic it has threatened the czech republic and poland with nuclear targeting if they host u s antimissile hardware on their soil that could not possibly threaten russias retaliatory potential it has exploited small price disputes normally resolved by lawyers screaming at each other to stop gas deliveries and thus show ukraine belarus and former warsaw pact members who runs things
8689941 georgia is the last of the independents so to speak a critical conduit of oil and gas that goes around russia into the black sea and with a planned gas pipeline via turkey into the mediterranean

8689951 i did not come to destroy but to fulfill whoever does and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
8689952 if you want to enter into life keep the commandments
8689953 if my kingdom were of this world my servants would fight but now my kingdom is not from here
8689954 you say rightly that i am a king for this cause i was born and for this cause i have come into the world that i should bear witness to the truth everyone who is of the truth hears my voice
8689955 i have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly
8689956 why should it be thought incredible by you that god raises the dead
8689957 one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection
8689958 with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the lord jesus
8689959 to this day i stand witnessing both to small and great that the christ the messiah would suffer that he would be the first to rise from the dead
8689960 but now christ is risen from the dead and has become
8689961 for our citizenship is in heaven from which we also eagerly wait for the savior the lord jesus christ who will transform our lowly physical material body that it may be conformed to his glorious body
8689962 behold i tell you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
8689963 for as the father raises the dead and gives life to them even so the son gives life to whom he will
8689964 i say to you the hour is coming and now is when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live for the hour is coming in which all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come forth
8689965 and i saw thrones and they sat on them and they lived and reigned with christ for a thousand years
8689966 but the rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years were finished
8689967 blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection over such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
8689968 you christ were slain and with your blood you purchased men for god from every tribe and language and people and nation you have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our god and they will reign on the earth
8689969 then i the apostle john saw a great white throne and him who sat on it and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books
8689970 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
8689971 and i if i am lifted up from the earth will draw all peoples to myself this he said signifying by what death he would die
8689972 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all
8689973 breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceedingly great army
8689974 then you israel shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up from your graves
8689975 i will put my spirit in you and you shall live
8689976 it is appointed for men to die once but after this the judgment
8689977 then he jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done because they did not repent woe to you chorazin woe to you bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon
8689978 and you capernaum if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day but i say to you that it shall more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for you

8689980 for as in adam all die even so in christ all shall be made alive but each one in his own order
8689981 is everything spinning out of control midwestern levees are bursting polar bears are adrift gas prices are skyrocketing home values are abysmal air fares college tuition and health care border on unaffordable wars without end rage in iraq afghanistan and against terrorism americans need do no more than check the weather look in their wallets or turn on the news for their daily reality check on a world gone haywire

8689983 remember the former things long past for i am god and there is no other i am god and there is no one like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things which have not been done saying my purpose will be established and i will accomplish all my good pleasure
8689984 for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
8689985 if we will not devise some greater and more equitable system than dealing with our problems through warfare armageddon will be at the door the problem basically is theological it must be of the spirit if we are to save the flesh
8689986 let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him
8689987 say to them as i live says the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked
8689988 listen to me you stubborn minded who are far from righteousness i bring near my righteousness it is not far off and my salvation will not delay
8689989 you will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed
8689990 then you the truly obedient and fully committed servants of god will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold but he who stands firm to the end will be saved
8689991 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations and then the end will come
8689992 but in the last days mount zion in jerusalem will be the most renowned of all the mountains of the world praised by all nations people from all over the world will make pilgrimages there
8689993 for in those days the whole world will be ruled by the lord from jerusalem
8689994 everyone will live quietly in his own home in peace and prosperity for there will be nothing to fear the lord himself has promised this in that coming day the lord says that he will bring back his punished people formerly unfaithful israelites sick and lame and dispossessed and make them strong again in their own land a mighty nation and the lord himself shall be their king from mount zion forever
8689995 that serpent of old called the devil and satan who deceives the whole world
8689996 for such men are false apostles deceitful workmen masquerading as apostles of christ and no wonder for satan himself masquerades as an angel of light it is not surprising then if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness their end will be what their actions deserve
8689997 but mark this there will be terrible times in the last days people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful proud abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy without love unforgiving slanderous without self control brutal not lovers of the good treacherous rash conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying its power always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth
8689998 at that time many will lose their faith and they will turn against each other and hate each other many false prophets will come and cause many people to believe lies there will be more and more evil in the world so most people will stop showing their love for each other but those people who keep their faith until the end will be saved the good news about gods kingdom will be preached in all the world to every nation then the end of human society under satans influence will come
8689999 i will gather all the nations to jerusalem to fight against it
