4190002 they have lots of sources thats what were hoping to get out of it were trying to get a whole lot of sources
4190003 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4190004 our policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and were acting without approval
4190005 one of the few things we know for sure is this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
4190006 weve learned from interviews and from other investigative avenues that hes very shrewd a very skilled manipulator thats hes able to ingratiate himself with people sometimes at the upper ranks of society

4190008 in germany he was a one off a bit crazy but he was no criminal before he left
4190009 he was very articulate a well spoken guy certainly quirky

4190224 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
4190225 then god said let us make man in our likeness
4190226 so god created man in his own likeness he created him in the likeness of god he created them as male and female
4190227 the lord god formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being
4190228 and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
4190229 so a man must not separate what god has joined together
4190230 to the married i give this command not i but the lord a wife must not separate from her husband but if she does she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and a husband must not divorce his wife to the rest i say this i not the lord if any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him he must not divorce her and if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her she must not divorce him

4190249 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4190250 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4190251 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4190252 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4190253 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4190254 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4190255 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4190256 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4190257 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4190258 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4190259 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4190260 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4190261 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4190262 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4190263 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history

4190303 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4190304 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4190315 in a time when more and more families are uninsured and feeling the financial strain of a bad economy its pretty incredible that the bush administration is actually trying to put up roadblocks for women trying to access basic health care
4190316 and will be fighting to preserve womens access to health care information
4190317 ill miss u today mimi u will have to play without me i love u amp gave her a hug amp kiss xoxoxoxs
4190318 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4190319 psymon oh you been away so long i forgot whatchoo cheeeeek taste like i hay my mind set on geevy you the cold shoulder next time but one look ah you delicious face and my cholder joos turn right into hot apple pie but its a la mode just so you know you aint off the hook that easy i need some quality time and real soon
4190320 then you have me at a disadvantage im afraid psymon has never mentioned you
4190321 raul i promise you some time in the very near future i hope you can forgive me now that the reason for my unavailability stands incarnate before you for now s and i are absolutely famished and if we could have a table and some privacy i promise that your desire for my companionship will not go long unsated
4190322 come this way boys you gonna get the best table in the house
4190323 we gonna bring you some nice tastin food real soon
4190324 they have one dish per day and so far theyve never let me down
4190325 yeah i get the sense that youve spent some time town here from raul
4190326 i hope it doesnt diminish your sense of self worth that my love is platonic
4190327 ive given you quite a bit to chew on in relation to my past id like a little reciprocity now if you dont mind
4190328 but youve had surprisingly few conversations with people that approach the whys
4190329 you always say that thats what im talking about tell you what if its broad address it broadly ill be listening and judging
4190330 what makes up a statement what are the building blocks of ideas
4190331 but what form do thoughts take that allows us to make them sensible
4190332 beliefs are collections of words that are assumed to be true i have to think about what i want to say
4190333 theyre approximations of our desire to represent our ideas to others but no word ever reveals the fullness of the object it describes in its entirety
4190334 to me thats an implication of a purpose given over do you think were here because were meant for something
4190335 i believe in discovering my aptitudes and appetites and in following where they lead me whether or not ive chosen rightly that opinion would only reflect the prevailing moral climate that im situated in i try hard to decide which choices are right for me and im not unwilling to compromise some when those decisions are at odds with someone elses feelings thats a big part of human adaptability i think tolerance its a poor substitute for real understanding but its all we have but meant as you interpret it isnt how i mean it i mean it as a descriptive word which takes our faculties as humans into account and explores the possibilities they disclose in relation to anything and everything that they affect or that affects them
4190336 i take my own consciousness of something as a starting point for investigation
4190337 its not a matter of faith its a matter of choice and its contextualized by a world thats always already there making questions possible
4190338 thats the kind of thinking i might find myself being persuaded by except for one thing ive been alive for more than 250 years and i barely look older than you do its not a choice ive made i believe that there is an answer to my question about why and i believe that when i know the answer to that question then ill know what im meant for and not meant the way you would use it to describe something about yourself i mean it the way that something or someone that knew it all along would use to describe me as a real and substantive revelation to a deep and compelling mystery
4190339 im not disallowing the existence of the kind of knowledge youre talking about
4190340 there are no pollutants the water quality is closely monitered to ensure ideal temperature and ph balances theres no freight time between when the fish dies and when you eat it and i recommend starting on the outside and working your way into the salad i know its nontraditional but i always like for the last bite i take to be the best tasting bite of the meal

4190363 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug pi3 kinase is one of these targets and that s why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
4190364 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug
4190365 pi3 kinase is one of these targets and thats why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
4190366 we were surprised by this result so we said okay if the gatekeeper in pi3 kinase is not the functional equivalent of the gatekeeper in protein kinases lets look at some other sites
4190367 what the result says is that maybe resistance will be a little bit harder to come by than in protein kinases so thats an advantage for those trying to make pi3 kinase drugs
4190368 and it may not be that hard to come up with other compounds that inhibit cancers that become resistant

4190381 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4190382 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger

4190507 september 11 2001 seems destined to be the watershed event of our lives and the greatest test for our democracy in our lifetimes the evidence of government complicity in the lead up to the events the failure to respond during the event and the astounding lack of any meaningful investigation afterwards as well as the ignoring of evidence turned up by others that renders the official explanation impossible may signal the end of the american experiment it has been used to justify all manners of measures to legalize repression at home and as a pretext for behaving as an aggressive empire abroad until we demand an independent honest and thorough investigation and accountability for those whose action and inaction led to those events and the cover up our republic and our constitution remain in the gravest danger

4190613 a companys reputation has a very big impact on stock prices and the reputation is what the stakeholders think about a company hence the idea of asking them to rate the companies we are not a rating agency and dont intend to become one our job is complementary to the job currently carried out by extra financial rating agencies
4190614 opensri will provide stakeholders with a method to express their opinions and promote responsible behaviour for companies in a constructive and sustainable way while offering a place where people will feel at ease to discuss and tackle relevant questions
4190615 opensri was born with the idea of a collaborative site where users spend a lot of time because they are involved in a project where every opinion has the same weight
4190616 opensri stakeholders have the ability to be heard by others and by the companies the sources are not anonymous for us but they will be anonymous for the public as all stakeholders will have a pseudonym to protect themselves but we will have the basic personal information at the moment of the registration

4190883 support of pearce comes nearly three months after he endorsed pearces rival
4190884 is set to endorse rep steve pearces r candidacy for his seat more than three months after domenici endorsed rep r over pearce in her unsuccessful primary bid
4190885 some e mailers pointed out that petes nod will come over two months after the primary and claimed it shows he remains unexcited by the pearce candidacy
4190886 but domenici was in no position to endorse pearce in june was he going to turn around just days after endorsing heather and rub nerves raw by coming for pearce also coming so soon would have made domenici look like the opportunist of the year

4190928 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the twenty first century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4190929 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
4190930 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
4190931 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
4190932 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
4190933 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive

4190955 it is the greatest scam in history i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4190956 some dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data to create in sic allusion of rapid global warming
4190957 other scientists of the same environmental whacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the
4190958 environmental extremists notable politicians among them then teamed up with movie media and other liberal environmentalist journalists to create this wild
4190959 now their ridiculous manipulated science has been accepted as fact and become a cornerstone issue for cnn cbs nbc the democratic political party the governor of california school teachers and in many cases well informed but very gullible environmental conscientious citizens
4190960 only one reporter at abc has been allowed to counter the global warming frenzy with one 15 minutes documentary segment

4190971 our study offers practitioners several relevant insights into how a family business can elevate financial performance
4190972 ultimately as the backbone of most economies throughout the world family businesses contribute to the economic and social fabric of their communities family businesses are proud of what they do and what they contribute it is our belief which is supported by our findings that they should communicate this pride to their customers as we have shown it does produce competitive advantages

4190974 an important reason to study metacognitive monitoring processes is because monitoring is supposed to play a central role in directing how people study

4190977 i believe that besides being an environmentally responsible action large scale renewable energy can provide stable cost effective electric prices far into the future however to facilitate the construction of such projects it is necessary that national grid be compelled to enter into long term contracts in order to provide lower cost financing for these projects such as the wind farm i have proposed
4190978 i was forced to veto the bill passed by the house and senate because it was fatally flawed renewable energy projects guaranteed by our ratepayers should be located in rhode island and also be cost effective and should not allow national grid to reap great monetary benefits without taking any risk
4190979 considering the out of control nature of the energy markets the stabilizing effects of cost effective renewable energy produced in rhode island should be part of national grids portfolio based on prudence
4190980 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4190981 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4190982 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4190983 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4190984 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4190985 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere

4191000 this interface standard is important to ensure that our customers have interoperable usb 3 0 systems devices and software drivers
4191001 microsoft has developed driver support for the usb industry standard since its inception and is committed to supporting the latest hardware technologies on the windows platform
4191002 microsoft intends to deliver windows support for hardware that is compliant with the xhci specification this is a huge step forward in enabling the industry and our customers to easily connect superspeed usb devices to their pcs for exciting new functionality and usages
4191003 nec electronics has supported intels ehci specification for usb 2 0 and whci specification for wireless usb 1 0 and developed solutions based on both of these standards
4191004 nec electronics will now provide usb 3 0 solutions based on intels xhci specification to ensure interoperability of our solution with multiple products from various manufacturers as we have done for usb 2 0 nec electronics would like to lead the usb 3 0 market with our discrete usb 3 0 host controller

4191020 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4191021 we never asked for a sum the only thing we ever said publicly was how much in our accounts mutu was worth when mutu left obviously he had a value in our account
4191022 that value was 13 million but when we made our case to fifa we did not ask for a specific amount
4191023 well i only have sex in relationships and any guy im with should feel the same
4191024 well i didnt say that im not monogamous when im in a relationship but if youre not with someone whats stopping you
4191025 if a guy is in a relationship with me he should only be having sex with me
4191026 well ive never been in one im not opposed to the idea i guess but its hard for me to say
4191027 well i have before and i probably will in the future i dont go that often but its nice to get out every once in a while
4191028 well i dont want a guy that likes to go out to those places he cant go without me and i dont like going
4191029 so because youve been hurt by guys who go to clubs and have differing opinions on relationships from you youre ruling everyone out
4191030 well theres a difference between settling and not giving someone a chance
4191031 did you ever think for a second that the reason you cant find anyone is because the guy that you want is a carbon copy of yourself
4191032 every girl is talented i think any of the 55 women can be in the top three im not stronger than them im just another girl to compete with them i know i worked for that his is another test in my life another part so and another experience and i will learn a lot with another olympic games
4191033 i dont think of myself as the favourite i only think i can be on the podium if everything will be alright with me but i know its not easy because every girl will be 100 and everyone will fight and they will do everything to have their best at these olympic games
4191034 im just going to be vanessa on race day just to do my best and take the pressure off my mind and to believe in me and believe in the work i have done in these last few years and last few months and to think that everything is possible
4191035 everything is different for these olympics really different in my first olympics i was young in the race i went with the girls and see what i can do but in the last four years i won some things and i put my name a little high in triathlon the mentality is different and my goals are different and im growing up
4191036 the last few years here i felt good but i know the humidity and the weather will be a little difficult for everyone so i dont know but i think i will feel good with this weather
4191037 i think maybe in the last months maybe a little but i think in the last few stages i have learned a lot with my coaches only not training physically but psychologically it was very good for that i think im prepared for monday
4191038 i think youll find that this is the real deal
4191039 i race for team halfords but im also on the management team at knockhill making this race one of my favourites of the year
4191040 winning here is really important to me in a whole lot of ways
4191041 i know the track like the back of my hand and coming off the back of a major result at oulton park in the last round im fired up and ready to go
4191042 like all riders we react in the way that we do sometimes
4191043 i think valentino has made similar comments from what toni has done in the past i think at the time maybe we overreacted
4191044 reports of the harm caused by css variables are greatly exaggerated
4191045 why does a page designer need to understand box models
4191046 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4191047 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4191048 friends of diries told the ottawa sun that he was dead six days before he was discovered
4191049 caldwell failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact regarding informed consent accordingly we find that the trial court properly granted the defendants renewed motion for summary judgment
4191050 because israel is challenging his assignment to the secure housing unit and because enforcement of prison disciplinary sanctions are not subject to judicial review israel s claim is not a claim upon which relief may be granted accordingly israel s claim is dismissible under the frivolous claim law we therefore affirm the trial court

4191052 to the end of his life he remained bitterly insistent that the building was based on his design
4191053 unwise in his political affiliations and he had an unfortunate knack for making people believe he was an ardent advocate of whatever they opposed
4191054 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4191055 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4191056 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4191057 whether you are bob kearns or gandhi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4191058 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4191059 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4191060 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4191061 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4191062 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4191097 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4191098 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4191131 this is the big big story of the history of cedar rapids this is the big one
4191132 every site that has been affected by the flood water has a personal story to go with it
4191133 and ive researched those stories and i tell those stories when i give tours
4191134 its just very personal i know some much about every site
4191135 theyre like my friends and theyve all been deluged by water
4191136 i think were just going to have to look at this and try to make sense out of this the best we can
4191137 if the tributaries into the cedar river got to their peaks as the cedar river crest was coming down that just all adds up to a bigger flood at cedar rapids
4191138 did i think it would get five feet in front of my house no
4191139 my life is here this house was full of treasures you cant put a price on
4191140 i thought i was going to lie down and die i was physically exhausted and the house was creaking and groaning
4191141 theres too much of a history with dostal catering just to walk away from it

4191146 by delivering an innovative compelling solution inside a unique form factor coolit helps enable ati radeon graphics processors to perform at high levels
4191147 as the technology continues to evolve in advanced gpu technology the value of efficient liquid cooling translates directly to the performance gains demonstrated in our lab

4191159 we generally see about a 100 percent increase in recycling in mid to affluent neighborhoods
4191160 in lower income neighborhoods it can be up to 1 000 percent because the recycling rates are so low there
4191161 if you think about solar or wind power or buying a hybrid theyre very important but today theyre not something thats accessible to the average person
4191162 i look at recycling as the average thing that every person and household can do

4191174 grad missile artillery mortar and machinegun fire has been reported dozens of blasts shatter the city every minute tens of armored vehicles and thousands of soldiers moved into the conflict zone
4191175 the ex soviet republic of georgia and its invasion over the last two days of the russian population of south ossetia the second half of north ossetia inside the russian federation looks to be linked to georgias breathtaking increases in its defense spending over the last few years and it looks set to beat all records this year in 2008 alone so far they are over 1 billion usd of gdp the fourth largest in eurasia in late june of 2006 the georgian government increased the defense ministrys budget of 513 million laris 315 million us dollars by 442 million laris 260 million dollars and the money arms and military training is not from a new growing economy its from the us taxpayer the pentagon and nato along with the usaid and yes the other nato aspirant ukraine
4191176 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms
4191177 israel began selling arms to georgia about seven years ago following an initiative by georgian citizens who immigrated to israel and became businesspeople
4191178 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4191179 the military cooperation between the countries developed swiftly the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
4191180 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
4191181 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
4191182 in addition to the trainers 1 000 soldiers from the vicenza italy based southern european task force airborne and the kaiserslautern based 21st theater sustainment command along with marine reservists with the 3rd battalion 25th marines out of ohio and the state of georgias army national guards 1st battalion 121st infantry participated in
4191183 operation immediate response 2008 was held from july 15 july 30 with u s personnel training about 600 troops at a former soviet base near tbilisi the largest city and capital of georgia the goal of this operation was allegedly teaching combat skills for missions in iraq the marines left already the country but not the airmen
4191184 south ossetia was a trap and putin took the bait unfortunately for bush the wily russian prime minister is considerably brighter than anyone in the current administration bushs plan will undoubtedly backfire and disrupt the geopolitical balance of power the world might get that breather from the us after all
4191185 georgian forces and separatists in south ossetia agree to observe a ceasefire and hold russian mediated talks to end their long simmering conflict
4191186 hours later georgian forces launch a surprise attack sending a large force against the breakaway province and reaching the capital tskhinvali
4191187 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4191188 russias goals in embarking on the war in georgia were twofold
4191189 no one in georgia or a western capital doubts that moscows lightning retaliation when georgian forces launched their surprise attack on the south ossetian capital was long planned
4191190 mr saakashvili ignored western warnings including those from the us secretary of state condoleeza rice not to respond to russian provocation but in the end he fell into the russian trap by ordering an ill planned strike while the eyes of the world were on the olympics he cannot have anticipated the overwhelming response from the nuclear power across the border involving massive firepower from tanks warplanes and battle hardened russian soldiers
4191191 but mr saakashvilis headstrong and impulsive behaviour sic in the crisis following his disastrous crackdown on demonstrators last november has eroded western support
4191192 perhaps the biggest mystery though is why georgia decided to take on russia now of course the situation had long been profoundly unsatisfactory from georgias point of view south ossetia and abkhazia were outside its control and undisguised platforms for russian trouble making
4191193 russias barely contested military sweep into georgia was a flexing of its muscles that leaves it undisputed master of the region once again

4191197 even chris powell of the gold anti trust action committee agrees with me and says in a pithy phrase that should congeal your blood at the tragic implications there are no markets anymore only interventions
4191198 doesnt mind admitting that technical analysis is pretty useless in the face of this kind of intervention
4191199 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars central banks then use the dollars they acquire to buy us government debt instruments so that they can earn interest on their money the debt instruments central banks acquire are held in custody for them at the federal reserve which reports this amount weekly
4191200 gold closed just above the 850 support line during a washout caused by the performance of a us dollar that defies belief without any improvement in fundamentals the dollar rose 132 points today the largest gain in years despite a banking crisis low interest rates huge deficits money supply running in double digits housing sector in shambles the us dollar has now risen 8 out of the last 9 days someone please convince me that this is not rigged meanwhile at 855 00 the gold price is back at 323 00 expressed in 1980 dollars
4191201 ted butler also mentioned yesterday that silver by any measurement is the most oversold its ever been in its history
4191202 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4191203 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4191204 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4191205 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4191206 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us

4191209 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown is a form of theological lunacy
4191210 youre basically killing each other to see whos got the better imaginary friend
4191211 most people i believe think that you need a god to explain the existence of the world and especially the existence of life they are wrong but our education system is such that many people dont know it
4191212 we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in some of us just go one god further

4191239 people make decisions to buy homes for a variety of reasons

4191445 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
4191446 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi

4191478 it is definitely a worldwide sport but there are some parts of the world that is not as popular and there is some confusion as to exactly what softball is and i think if we go over there to beijing and we put on the best show you have ever seen of olympic softball that people are going to understand this needs to stay in the olympics
4191479 brazil russia italy china i think we are all at a very very high level now pretty even

4191484 the question is he going to quit no hes not going to
4191485 with the soviet union you did get the sense that they were operating on a model that we could comprehend in terms of they dont want to be blown up we dont want to be blown up so you do game theory and calculate ways to contain
4191486 i think there are certain elements within the islamic world right now that dont make those same calculations
4191487 i think there are elements within pakistan right now if musharraf is overthrown and they took over i think we would have to consider going in and taking those bombs out because i dont think we can make the same assumptions about how they calculate risks

4191511 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4191512 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4191513 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4191514 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4191521 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4191522 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4191541 i think the competition will really be a showdown between two american gymnasts
4191542 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4191543 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4191544 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4191545 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4191546 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4191547 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4191548 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4191549 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4191550 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4191551 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4191552 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4191553 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4191554 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4191555 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4191556 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4191557 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4191558 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4191563 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4191570 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico

4191686 obamas economic plan is geared toward getting the economy going again and easing the struggle of ordinary americans

4191690 we mustnt underestimate the netherlands a team with great individuals and who play great football were argentina and as such were aiming for gold but well respect every opponent that crosses our path that is our formula

4191700 todays it world demands ever increasing collaboration between organizations and their partners and vendors however the powerful collaboration solutions that are being implemented using products such as sharepoint tend to focus heavily on internal teams and the need to make information broadly available throughout an organization in such cases the challenges both from an administrative and security perspective of providing access to users external to an organization are often significant in the face of such challenges the goal becomes enabling users to reach out to external partners on an ad hoc basis the combination of groove and sharepoint offers exactly that solution sharepoint provides intra organization collaboration content search and a workflow framework adding groove lets companies extend those capabilities to include easy inter organization collaboration with groove users can quickly set up collaboration workspaces that cross company boundaries furthermore support for 192 bit advanced encryption standard aes symmetric keys ensures that the collaboration is secure in fact groove security is built in and always on so users dont have to worry about configuring it the security architecture of groove provides a high degree of protection for these workspaces and their contents both while stored locally and during network transmission the sharepoint files tool allows this information to be bi directionally synchronized with a sharepoint document library to ensure that the information is available centrally for easy internal access lets use a concrete example to see how this process works

4191702 we are in a world where governments have not decided yet whether the tools of cyberattacks are weapons
4191703 we dont have any really clear international understandings about these matters
4191704 its ultimately the perception of the country under attack as to whether an act of war was committed
4191705 everyone was in an unspoken way looking forward to the next presidency to try to resolve the ownership issue

4191726 if you have 10 associates in a photo lab and six sign union authorization cars now the store is unionized
4191727 the statements are not correct representations of what the law would require even under the current law
4191728 it would be a violation of the national labor relations act to say those things
4191729 if democrats get the votes they need and elect a democratic president they said it will be the first bill presented and thats scary

4191732 schip and medicaid provide an important safety net for americas families especially for families with chronically ill children these programs allow kids to get the care they need so they can feel better grow stronger and thrive in school
4191733 when children who need care do not receive it their conditions worsen and are harder and more expensive to treat later because of medicaid and schip millions of kids can get regular check ups take the medications they need to stay well and see a doctor when they are sick parents of any uninsured child should find out if their family is eligible for low cost or free insurance before sending their kids back to school

4191741 the gaming market has enormous potential to extend brands across platforms
4191742 and connect 2 media is well positioned to exploit this
4191743 as customers try new and increasingly complex wireless phone services and products such as playing mp3 files capturing still pictures or video or downloading ringtones they are more likely to call their provider for support
4191744 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact
4191745 they could have died within months to a year or two
4191746 they direct traffic recognize when foreign invaders come into the body and they can induce formation of killer cells to go after the invader
4191747 the antibody decorates tumor cells so any passing t cell touching that cell briefly will adhere to it much longer than normal and then the whole program of cell killing is kicked off
4191748 i think its exciting that we have new tools to treat cancer
4191749 whenever you have specificity to act against the cancer cell and also solicit host systems to combat the cancer i think thats an advance

4191840 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4191841 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4191842 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4191843 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4191844 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4191845 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4191846 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people

4191863 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to

4191868 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4191869 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4191870 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4191871 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4191873 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4191874 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4191875 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4191876 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4191877 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4191878 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars
4191879 i believe that is a definite risk for dion right now

4191956 you set priorities you do what you can children cooking shopping people maintenance then leave the rest until you can get to it sometimes that means clutter
4191957 when i went to the pain doctor i asked why didnt i do this before
4191958 it never occurred to me i thought chronic pain was people with cancer its not just back and knees there are all kinds of people who are in chronic pain they still need to go to work every day and watch their kids

4191963 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4191964 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4191999 a lot of students think they can get a cute puppy and thats not a big deal but there are things that need to be considered
4192000 the main thing we see at the animal hospital is usually students who havent considered the financial aspect of having a pet and students who are completely unaware of the care pets require
4192001 students need to keep in mind that pets require lots of time money and a commitment to providing a lifelong home for the animal they really need to think over their situation and determine whether or not its the best time in their life to get a pet
4192002 adopting a pet is a big decision and shouldnt be done on a whim and without planning a pet someone gets in college is going to be with him or her for 15 years or more in many cases and that needs to be considered
4192003 we dont deal with much of that at college park animal hospital but i have worked at other clinics where people would bring in animals that students had left at dorms or at the house they were living at
4192004 i think thats the best option thats what i did and then my mom wouldnt give my cat back

4192012 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
4192013 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
4192014 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
4192015 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
4192016 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

4192048 sharks were a very important part of the coastal chumash diet
4192049 what that is indicating is a cultural preference among the soldiers families and some kind of bias they have against eating sharks
4192050 when sharks were captured and skinned pieces of their skins were allowed to dry and were later used for polishers they used them like sandpaper to smooth all of their woodworking especially for close fitting of the planks to each other
4192051 just because its a conspicuous top level predator doesnt mean it would necessarily have a role in myths or legends

4192108 matthew purposely arranges the genealogy into 3 divisions of fourteen generations each in other words he purposely leaves out four kings in order to retain his structural arrangement the question is why would matthew want fourteen names in each list and why would he only list 13 names in the central section the answer to both questions is david we notice in verse 1 that matthew purposefully places david before abraham abandoning the chronological order of the rest of the genealogy why does he place david first for emphasis in fact davids prominence in verse one is a key to the whole book matthews unique emphasis is that jesus is the king of the jews the promised progenitor of david with this understanding we move now to verse 6 and give david a double portion in other words by counting david twice our list suddenly becomes 14 14 14 what is more striking is that the letters of davids name have a numeric value in hebrew of 14 while this type of numeric interpretation gematria is quite foreign to us it was a common rabbinic method of interpretation the hebrew language uses its alphabet as its numbering system as well therefore children would learn arithmetic with the letters of their names making this kind of numerology more common and more easily recognized matthew like luke and john introduces his book with a style marvelously appropriate to his audience
4192109 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4192110 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people

4192115 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4192116 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity

4192155 when you stop and think it s harvest time for everybody and that they are willing to shut down and come over here that just about brings tears to your eyes just the feeling that it gives you something that is just really hard to explain unless you experience it
4192156 walked over to the side of the machine kicked the lever to dump the rock trap looked under while nothing fell out so i crawled under and just brushed it to get that stuff to fall out kinda brushed it once and nothing happened and i brushed it again a little harder and that is when it grabbed my hand it was all over in a matter of seconds
4192157 we could have twenty twenty five machines here that is how many people want to come over here to help this guy that has been in the community forever and is a very good frneds wth the whole communty
4192158 and just knowing that all of your neighbors who are busy doing there stuff set aside their own for today to help ths great man out is just be there its just really touching
4192159 it would be really easy to get down maybe on yourself and what you do and think when people come together and help like that it not only gets the job of getting the harvest done but it gives him a huge lift
4192160 like i told a neighbor here the other day i said

4192188 politicians fear that they will lose control with e government and this is coming in the way of successful implementation of e government projects in india
4192189 e government helps simplify processes and makes the government faceless its not possible to achieve that without a strong leadership vested interests are certainly delaying the process
4192190 both the central and state governments have followed a silo approach to e government some implementation has taken place but it has tended to be piecemeal and disjointed thereby having little impact
4192191 the biggest challenge before e government is not technology but change management

4192193 esta madrugada espec ficamente a las dos de la ma ana se tom esta importante decisi n para el per basada fundamentalmente en el apoyo permanente de colombia y ecuador
4192194 hace un mes se realiz la primera votaci n y el resultado fue sin consenso la segunda votaci n realizada hoy tuvo como resultado 3 a 1 es decir ha sido aceptado por mayor a siendo bolivia el opositor a esta decisi n
4192195 la presidencia pro tempore a cargo de ecuador present una opci n que recog a la voluntad de consenso incluyendo la de bolivia no obstante a la hora de la verdad este pa s no quiso aceptarlo lo que es muy triste
4192196 hemos buscado el consenso por mucho tiempo acomod ndonos a los pedidos que este pa s hac a pero siempre hubo esa actitud negativa esa no es la forma de buscar la integraci n porque bolivia no quiere dar nada pero exige que le den todo esa no es una actitud de cooperaci n el per agradece a ecuador y colombia por habernos apoyado permanentemente
4192197 hoy tendremos una reuni n para ver esto y si un pa s como es el caso de bolivia quiere imponer su visi n personalista a tres pa ses pues ser muy dif cil que logremos avanzar por ello debemos tomar una decisi n global quedamos tres pa ses que pese a nuestras diferencias nos respetamos y otro que no nos respeta
4192198 lo que sucede es que el per trabaja perfectamente con ecuador y colombia por ello no hay motivo para retirarnos del bloque solo por la intransigencia de un pa s
4192199 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem

4192223 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4192224 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4192225 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4192226 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4192227 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4192228 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4192229 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4192230 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4192239 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4192240 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
4192241 so i think that they had an opportunity to make some very broad points and i think they seized that opportunity
4192242 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem

4192253 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4192254 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4192255 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4192256 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4192257 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4192258 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4192259 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4192260 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4192261 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4192262 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4192263 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4192264 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4192265 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4192266 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4192267 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4192268 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4192269 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4192270 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4192271 if hospitals were to set up efforts to follow these longstanding practices the vast majority of these medical errors and infections could be prevented
4192272 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4192273 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4192274 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4192275 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4192276 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4192277 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4192278 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4192279 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4192280 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4192281 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4192282 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4192283 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4192284 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4192285 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4192286 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4192287 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4192288 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4192289 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4192290 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4192291 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4192292 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4192293 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4192294 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4192295 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4192296 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4192297 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4192298 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4192299 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4192300 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4192301 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4192302 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4192303 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4192305 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4192306 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4192307 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4192308 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4192309 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4192310 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4192311 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4192312 count it all joy when testing and frustrating circumstances come our way because these testings make us mature
4192313 all things circumstances will work for our good if we keep on loving god seeking his purpose in everything
4192314 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4192315 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
4192316 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4192317 georgias d n r w r d weighs in on bigfoot
4192318 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4192319 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4192320 if its not about jesus then somehow the gospel is not being preached
4192321 what is this to me and you woman my hour has not yet come

4192325 we will sign someone after this weekend but before the twenty game
4192326 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4192327 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4192328 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4192329 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4192330 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4192331 this was a big game for us we had this one circled for a long time
4192332 a few of us felt we really needed this game to prove to ourselves we do mean business and were ready to win the gold medal
4192333 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4192334 kobe had a lot of good dunks that was crazy
4192335 they pretty much picked us apart in 2006 the only way to change that was to be aggressive
4192336 were built to play defense we will eventually impose our will and wear them down
4192337 the defense in the second quarter turned it around for us
4192338 we played very good defense im proud of our effort
4192339 every time we go out of the hotel they are celebrating us
4192340 if we meet them again its going to be harder to beat us
4192341 i think we learned a lot my team can play better we gave them opportunities to make easy baskets
4192342 an increase in consumption of total fruit and vegetables by 100 grams 3 5 ounces per day was associated with an 11 percent decrease in the incidence of esophageal scc
4192343 in the most difficult capital market conditions in recent history we are pleased that perseus and our co investors have recognized the excellent work done by our talented team led by mark hogan our ceo the strong demand for our vehicles and the strength of our strategic partnerships their commitments will provide the resources needed by vpg to move into production
4192344 slow or limited in intellectual or emotional development or academic progress
4192345 are things like that even meant to be worn i mean really who would wear an outfit with stuffed hands sewn onto a dress
4192346 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4192347 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
4192348 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac

4192359 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4192360 in my judgement this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality
4192361 and i think it is something that all democratic countries should speak out strongly against and i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4192362 obviously weve called on both sides to cease the fighting and i gather a ceasefire now appears to be taking hold but we do call on russia to respect the
4192363 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4192364 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4192365 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4192366 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4192367 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4192368 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4192369 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4192370 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4192371 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4192372 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4192373 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
4192374 after you read the article its astonishing that scheunemann is even still with the campaign and it just adds to the continuing mystery of how mccain preserves this image of being the scourge of lobbyists when he is almost a caricature of the kind of politician whose conduct is managed by a series of lobbyists who manage his actions on almost every point of policy
4192375 may have used his position in the mccain campaign for his own financial benefit by advancing the interests of his former lobbying client the georgian government

4192406 this program will help the children of darfur maintain hope for a better life through education it represents the people of pricewaterhousecoopers at their best
4192407 we have built a strong successful organization over the past 10 years and demonstrated that we can accomplish great things when we work together our unique partnership with unhcr is evidence of what can be accomplished when elements of the public and private sectors make a commitment to work together to get things done the impact is profound
4192408 when i saw the power of 10 challenge i and many others felt the responsibility to try to give the children of darfur the same powerful tool for development that we have had

4192439 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the twenty first century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4192440 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
4192441 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
4192442 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
4192443 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
4192444 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive

4192447 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country as the dissenting judge noted the majoritys opinion gave federal officials the license to violate constitutional rights with virtual impunity now the court has the opportunity to uphold the law and hold accountable the u s officials who sent maher to be tortured
4192448 we have reopened our review into the mr arar matter because less than a month ago we received additional information that contradicts one of the conclusions in our report as such we are in the process of conducting additional interviews to determine the validity of this information to the extent we can

4192456 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
4192457 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
4192458 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay

4192472 but amongst the mobile applications weve been rolling out some of them are particularly tailored to the mobile user such as the mobile user real estate listings
4192473 in america i think the general web browsing for the mobile site has been at an advantage in terms of user behavior and pricing over sms products
4192474 the predominant long term mass consumption will be more than likely be browsing just because thats such a dominant behavior here in the us

4192510 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4192511 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4192512 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4192549 he could learn a lot from burns because he was a great social satirist hes got tonnes of skills that paxman could only dream of in terms of interrogating humanity
4192550 although i am afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state
4192551 we all know he likes to poke fun at scotland so we allowed the forward to stand its not our place to censor him
4192552 i think we are strong enough as a nation to take it on the chin

4192560 wenn einer ins amt k me der die w hler so an der nase herumgef hrt hat dann w re das ein skandal f r diese republik
4192561 die frage ist ob die spd noch die kraft hat sich der politischen geiselnahme von frau ypsilanti zu erwehren
4192562 its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team
4192563 maybe if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4192564 he didnt play his best today but i felt like i served well when i needed to especially in that tiebreaker
4192565 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game
4192566 i dont know how im going to react when i see brett favre in a jets uniform
4192567 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4192568 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4192569 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4192570 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan
4192571 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4192572 its cool that a preseason game has more hype its going to be intense its going to be a big game up there
4192573 it takes a minute to have a crush an hour to like someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone
4192574 so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4192575 when i looked at the board i thought wow i just did it
4192576 i was going to improve my time a bit more but i guess that to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4192577 i cant swim faster than kosuke but it could have been possible to get a better result
4192578 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others
4192579 we swam together and i felt like we were training
4192580 i have always focused on a period of four years and to go any faster it would be impossible
4192581 ive won it twice the most prestigious event im happy ive done that
4192582 its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team
4192583 maybe if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4192584 he didnt play his best today but i felt like i served well when i needed to especially in that tiebreaker
4192585 after the athens games i wanted to retire from the national team because i thought i was in very good shape back then
4192586 if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold my coach huang yubin kept on encouraging me he took me on a vacation and told me that the 2008 games would be the greatest chance in 100 years and i should have a try at it he kept pushing me and then he kicked me to the highest position on the podium
4192587 its very special and even in my dreams i never said i would have a bronze medal
4192588 after so many years of competition especially in all around theres no more outside pressure that can influence me
4192589 today the reason i couldnt get on the podium was because of my landings
4192590 unlike the team events my landings werent coming off today
4192591 today i stepped up my defense greece likes to run the pick and roll and we prepared for that
4192592 we ran the break the right way we got stops when we were supposed to get stops
4192593 we just put it all together we are starting to realize when we can make our move
4192594 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4192595 i have a collection now i have a gold a silver and a bronze
4192596 mishin was the world champion so beating him is an impressive feat
4192597 the gold medal is what we came to get to go back with a bronze is good but its not what i came to get
4192598 i prepared for a hard war psychologically i got enough preparation to fight against park
4192599 the rain affected me a little bit but we train a lot in the rain we even train in the cold rain but its disrupting a little bit
4192600 you figure if the first arrow doesnt go in the gold youre unsure if you should touch the sights or not i actually shot really well with the way i feel it just wasnt meant to be i guess
4192601 it was absolutely excellent i am so proud so many people supported me they came in the rain to see me its just great
4192602 heike had a super round and that gave us a positive entry nadine had a solid performance and i just had to do my thing
4192603 weve all managed to maintain our focus together as a team and i think hugh is really glad for that
4192604 every run we score against the usa is important and anything is possible
4192605 with the bases loaded and no outs we may score eight or we may score three but everything you take into the next game is important
4192606 im not good at waiting and neither are my guys but im glad they called it when they did
4192607 when youre down seven to zip your chances of scoring against my pitching staff is not very good
4192608 this was very much an uncharacteristic first inning for us
4192609 its because of our experience and skills and i feel that both of us have all around skills and we find ways to win
4192610 maybe im the favorite but i dont pay attention to that
4192611 weve the u s got five guys left everyone on the team can do it well just go out there and do our best
4192612 we wanted to play our way in the second half
4192613 and we wanted to keep pushing germany is a good team and if you do not concentrate for the whole game they will make you pay with goals
4192614 we had a bad shooting day both teams were tired and sluggish on their shots
4192615 there are no words to explain this its just amazing to get two extra points russia missed a free throw to give us another chance it really was just a lucky punch it is incredible that we have three points after this match
4192616 wow somebody liked my stuff enough to link it to wha
4192617 local georgians are planning to march from the un to the russian consulate thursday afternoon to protest the conflict in their native country
4192618 act as an international guarantor of the two pro russian enclaves at the center of the crisis

4192620 were on pace to be the most watched olympics ever
4192621 is michael phelps the greatest american athlete of all time
4192622 my hearts pounding my stomach is starting to do flip flops but im trying to be very composed on the outside i hope it comes across that way
4192623 i dont think we should leave here this week for a monthlong recess until we have dealt with the single most important problem facing american people today and our economy high diesel prices
4192624 that was not acceptable to the georgians who left the discussion
4192625 after they left they sent down a team of georgian special forces soldiers to discuss with the russians access to the town
4192626 at that point the russians fearing some sort of assault was under way moved their tanks from the centre of town to the edge of the town

4192656 my friends went down to see where i could go and they opened a side door but only found a big hall with stairs
4192657 my friend offered to carry me up there so i could get up there but i was scared she was going to drop me so i crawled up there

4192687 its extremely frustrating because were the ones that have to face the students when theyre buying the textbooks and we have very little control over the biggest component that goes into pricing the textbook
4192688 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4192689 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4192690 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4192691 the obama campaign has made no significant headway among former clinton backers over the past two months the voting preferences of clintons supporters are virtually identical to earlier polls in june and july
4192692 teenage girls are struggling to find a positive identity thats not completely defined by their sexuality positive role models can help them find the strength to resist being sexualized by mens needs
4192693 pupils shouldnt assume that weve met every target in gender equality how then do you explain the way popular culture portrays women we need to find a place in the curriculum to look at violence against women and sexist bullying
4192694 girls may do better than boys in tests but it doesnt matter how they perform academically they still dont get paid as much in the workplace
4192695 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4192696 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4192697 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4192698 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4192699 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4192700 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4192701 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4192702 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4192703 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4192704 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4192705 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4192706 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4192707 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4192708 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4192709 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4192710 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran
4192711 though not a veteran himself corsi co authored unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4192712 lets see exactly why it isnt the case that islam is a worthless dangerous satanic religion wheres the proof to the contrary
4192713 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects
4192714 first lets undermine the us in vietnam then we can go for gay marriage when you get to be pres jfk lite there will be no end to how much of america we can destroy
4192715 just dont let anybody put a tablet with the ten commandments in front of the school where that girl wants to wear a muslim scarf oh no then the rats would complain anti christian anti american just like their presidential candidate jean francois kerrie
4192716 after he married terrahsa didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal gradparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4192717 john f ing commie kerry and commie ted discuss their plan to hand america over to our nations enemies
4192718 forget about democracy just get out the checkbook and put everybody in iraq on the payroll thats all they want pay them first democracy or some b s islamic version of it will follow
4192719 mohammed al mohammed proclaiming guidance from his hate god ned allah kills another dozen women and children by convincing a teenager to blow him her self up for victory in another world

4192725 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects a throwback medieval anti modern anti science anti knowledge doctrine
4192726 forget it the only thing these islamonazis understand is force time to nuke the temple of the dome and send this
4192727 go for the oil fields set the mad dog lawyers loose lets roll take even the diapers from their heads remember according to the koran islam approves of lying as long as it is to non believers saudis are lying killers who harbor killers
4192728 islam is like a virus it infects the minds of the believers
4192729 good plan raise obl from the dead every time we get ready to ice another islamonazi on to baghdad lets roll
4192730 nuke the islam nazis and lets move on no more muslamo fascists
4192731 islam has declared world war iii against everything non muslim
4192732 when will the liberal media wake up to see that islam has declared a world war against everyting non muslim may allah be damned to the hell muslims wish to create on earth
4192733 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there
4192734 all arab muslims lie the koran endorses lying to infidels namely us none of these names are real abdallah is really mohammad mohammad mohammad readily altered to include atta or haj or whatever else they decide to call themselves for the moment
4192735 gotta love this stupid religion islam makes the nazis look like a sunday stroll in the park islam its gotta be straight from hell just the devil in disguise that seems to about sum it up
4192736 arabs lie islam preaches lying to infidels fingerprints dont lie boo hoo time to demand ids to check into hotels and passport registration for all foreign nationalists who want hotel rooms also id checks and passport registrations for anyone renting an apartment
4192737 lets get rid of all the saudi arabians that would have gone a long way to preventing sept 11
4192738 yet another violent raghead named mohammad whats new islam looks like a cancer a plague a deadly virus no doctor worries about the free speech rights of cancer cells
4192739 yet another little islamic man of hate is there any other kind
4192740 the only thing the islamic world understands is force lets destroy a few of these hate schools and start targeting these mad preachers of hate
4192741 lets see who is it not politically correct to profile
4192742 finally a way to end jihad maybe the whole arab world will blow itself up live by the sword die by the sword seems an ancient formula bye bye jihad
4192743 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living great to repeat it keeps the thread going let the muslims stop preaching terror and ill revise my view meanwhile muslims cancer cells is an equation that works
4192744 may all these arab maniacs explode and kill themselves next time maybe they will take arab rat with them best solution to the homicide bombers is that they eliminate themselves with as little loss to civilians as possible
4192745 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4192746 muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4192747 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4192748 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records

4192801 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4192802 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4192803 these days more writers seek freelance work spurred on by promises of big paychecks in myriad get rich quick e books sold online
4192804 the result is a flood of inexperienced poorly qualified writers ive seen increasingly club fisted writing showing up in sales letters online and offline are copywriters today so tone deaf so mired in over the top hard sell patter that they cant hear how ridiculous they sound
4192805 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4192806 this has been very very difficult for the city for the state and thats obviously why we need a resolution
4192807 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney

4192816 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4192817 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia

4192832 its a party you take a mask so that nobody knows who you are when you walk in you go downstairs into the dark room you take off your clothes and keep them next to you and lay down after awhile somebody in a mask will come in and take your virginity away thats what i heard what happens are you going then
4192833 dont worry nobody will know if you go thats the point you get your first time over with
4192834 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4192835 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4192836 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4192837 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4192838 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4192839 we never say dont turn the ball over its aggressive ball security we want to score a lot of points and we want to secure the football its going to be the same thing with troy were going to be aggressive in everything we do offensively
4192840 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4192841 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4192842 my first response is its a comedy were really making fun of ourselves the whole movie is about actors and actors who try to do things to be taken seriously so in the context of the movie im really comfortable thats how it comes off
4192843 everybody of course is entitled to their opinion when you make a movie you have to kind of go with your gut i feel like our heart is in the right place with it
4192844 with any comedy anything you put out there some people are gonna get it some people are gonna be into it and other people wont but the movie ive screened it so many times with audiences its fun to see audiences laugh everybody doesnt take it as seriously when you get outside of it and people talk about these issues we all want to laugh at ourselves
4192845 its amazing hes a really funny actor and he doesnt get a chance to do comedies
4192846 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4192847 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4192848 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4192849 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
4192850 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
4192851 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
4192852 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
4192853 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
4192854 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4192855 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
4192856 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
4192857 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
4192858 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
4192859 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
4192860 he is not from another planet he is from the future
4192861 i thought my love life was over when they amputated my head how wrong i was i was soon to discover
4192862 her turpitude was unwhelming me to the point of abstract lethargy as i slipped into a dizzy pool of relaxation imagery
4192863 no you cannot serve the turducken in that vulgar and unseemly manner i insisted as i reduced my invisibility to a factor of 5
4192864 billy was sad to see the little purple pony in the sandbox again it loved to eat slips of paper with peoples names on them and then they died
4192865 basically bulemics are fat skinny people people who dont have discipline to watch what they eat and exercise
4192866 stop complaining you knew it would be the hardest undertaking of your life
4192867 do whatever you have to to make it better for her
4192868 stop being so damn stubborn and get your heart checked out
4192869 i have to have an emergency triple bypass i have to go to the hospital right away
4192870 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call
4192871 the project is one of the biggest of its kind to date
4192872 the agreement concerns chemical processes that can capture carbon dioxide from the process industry and emissions from coal and gas powered power stations
4192873 within these sectors it is estimated that the 4 000 largest facilities account for more than 40 percent of man made carbon dioxide emissions globally
4192874 norway will be among the few countries with a complete set of laboratories in this area from testing in the lab to pilot runs at semi industrial scale
4192875 maybe if i slap him and then make a run for it ill be ok
4192876 it is easy to become discouraged and even a little frightened by a bad economy small agencies are especially vulnerable but much of the failure is caused not by a bad economy but by the fear of one those agencies that pursue their goals regardless of the economic situation will have much more success than those who allow it to dictate business decisions
4192877 due to the tight situation in the global plant construction sector which has caused price increases for individual works
4192878 demand for our steel products remains very pleasing as reflected in continued price increases fully confirming our expectations of another good steel year
4192879 the growth was again driven mainly by china with an increase of almost 10 per cent in the european union output was at the prior year level
4192880 crude futures were a little higher on thursday as the bullish us report continued to lift oil markets
4192881 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline
4192882 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market
4192883 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july
4192884 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4192885 as the technology continues to evolve in advanced gpu technology the value of efficient liquid cooling translates directly to the performance gains demonstrated in our lab
4192886 we recently benchmarked this card using 3d mark vantage and increased the graphics score from x7125 at stock settings to x8148 which represents a performance increase of well over 10
4192887 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4192888 i think buyers are a bit edgy about the russia georgia situation knowing thats not completely resolved theyre looking for some geopolitical risk premium
4192889 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the us dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro
4192890 since then the greenback has improved by 6 9 per cent
4192891 it was the worst thing having to sit at home and watch the games you dont even feel like you are part of the team atkins said
4192892 if a candidate withdraws from a race that doesnt invalidate the slate
4192893 if mitch mcconnell withdraws from the race that doesnt mean john mccain is not on the ballot
4192894 instead of blaming someone we ought to pass a bill that deals with the problem we are in an energy crisis whether you like to admit it or not its affecting anyone and everyones pocketbook
4192895 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4192896 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4192897 in a lot of the other matches it has been a point here or there
4192898 thats why he was no 1 in the world he played those points better than everyone today i played them well
4192899 they couldnt be hurt that bad because they both split
4192900 just speculating its possible it could be a drunk driver involved
4192901 he gets to the point he is respectful and straightforward
4192902 were a couple of weeks away and now youve got to start over again
4192903 cordy has come on as right guard but hes talented enough to play right tackle
4192904 hes probably talented enough to play left tackle but hes used to playing on the right so if we move him to right tackle we could move tripp to left tackle
4192905 weve seen a lot of stuff like this in the past
4192906 when thomas brown went down last year knowshon moreno stepped up theres instances all across the board where people go down and youve got to step up thats the sign of a good team and hopefully we can do it
4192907 to know the backside of your quarterback is protected and knowing that he knows what to do
4192908 its sad for him of course he worked so hard and got up to the 310 pound range its hard to lose experience
4192909 i dont know hot he feels roday after sleeping and waking up and then how hell feel after surgery
4192910 however im happy for the other freshmen and rest of the team theyve earned the shot at being no 1 hopefully i can take care of what i have to do in prep school and join those guys at georgia in time for bowl practice
4192911 they just encouraged me telling me to stay focused and stay hungry
4192912 they told me to use my time wisely at hargrave
4192913 its a big challenge because those are huge shoes to fill
4192914 but im looking forward to it and im excited about it brannans been supporting me and helping me out in any way he can
4192915 he hasnt done it in a lot of games but hes gotten good time in practice
4192916 he touched the ball a lot in high school too if you practice hard all youve got to do is do it on saturday
4192917 what helped me a lot last year coming to this year was getting to play some
4192918 i kind of know what to expect instead of coming into this without knowing what to expect im not a wide eyed freshman so ive got an idea what to do
4192919 besides being no 2 fullback and going in as the no 1 this year shauns a great friend of mine off the field
4192920 i hang out with him all the time as far as nerves and ability hes got it down hes got enough experience from last year its not a situation where i want him to do anything bad i want him to do well hopefully when i come back hes going to be playing great so theres going to be competition to get playing time thats what we want and it makes the team better
4192921 he can run he can block he can catch the ball coming out of the backfield thats what youve got to have and hes showing it on the practice field
4192922 im really really upset about that because hes one of my best friends im definitely going to go out and do what i can do im excited to get this opportunity but i wish it hadnt happened this way
4192923 ive got to play hard and keep going at it he was a huge part of our team so ive got some big shoes to fill ive got to make sure im putting out the effort and i know what to do
4192924 were really happy with how josh is playing right now
4192925 hes stepped in and is doing a really good job
4192926 i try to stay away from the full tackling and the contact while my ankle heals up
4192927 i can tell its starting to get stronger but i still cant do a lot of things it hurts when i make cuts and things like that but i can tell a difference this week from last week i feel like sometimes youve got to take one step back to take two steps forward
4192928 a estrat gia de exporta o de produtos agr colas pelo brasil deu muito certo at agora mas est se revelando um ponto fraco porque a crise econ mica na europa e nos estados unidos n o vai poupar o brasil

4192932 hes the most complete tight end in the country when it comes to blocking and catching
4192933 the others are more athletic who are ranked higher but theyre going to have to learn to block and arthur wont
4192934 turbulence in the financial markets the rise in the price of oil and the fall of the dollar are making their mark on germany
4192935 means more than just a correction from an unusually strong first quarter
4192936 recent leading indicators have all pointed to a sharp slowdown in the second half manufacturing output has slowed sharply in recent months indicating that the prolonged period in which the german industry appeared to be immune against the toxic mix of global slowdown strong currency and very high oil prices has now come to an end
4192937 with growth collapsing in germanys most important trading partner countries we think recession is now also possible in germany
4192938 the leading indicators have meanwhile fallen sharply suggesting that a hard landing is on the cards although not as severe as in spain or the uk
4192939 will have to revise down its growth projections appreciably in september
4192940 however we only expect an initial rate cut once there is mounting evidence that headline inflation is moderating and the core rate has remained stable i e probably not before spring 2009
4192941 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on

4192945 farm conditions remain quite strong throughout the world driving our agricultural operations at an unprecedented level
4192946 the data are higher than expected and should push treasury rates higher although with energy and other commodity prices having come down the markets may discount some of these data as old news
4192947 still the level is holding above 400 000 and it seems to reflect mostly labor market weakness
4192948 a lot of the frameworks and walls built because of the old financial world we grew up in will come down
4192949 people think theyre diversifying by investing in a country and it leads to inadequate diversification
4192950 because the country of origin or incorporation is not the primary influence on the stock price
4192951 well be thinking in terms of global markets all the time

4192987 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4192988 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates

4193015 these results represent significant progress of a t cell engaging antibody for treatment of lymphoma patients as single agent therapy we observed tumor regression in patients at serum levels of blinatumomab which are approximately five orders of magnitude lower than serum levels needed by conventional monoclonal antibodies for achieving a tumor regression in this disease this may relate to the high anti tumor activity of cytotoxic t cells recruited by blinatumomab

4193026 varf r betala f r n got man inte vill ha
4193027 det logiska r att man betalar f r det man vill ha ingen ska tvingas betala f r n got man inte vill ha i dag finns ett stort utbud med betalkanaler som fungerar och konkurrens mellan dessa s varf r skulle det inte fungera f r svt ocks fr gar sig micke
4193028 det r enkelt att med digital tv begr nsa tillg ngen till svt s kanaler s att enbart de som betalar avgift kan se det kallas betal tv och anv nds av andra programbolag varf r kan inte svt anv nda sig av det
4193029 konstigt att svenska folket ska beh va tvingas att betala f r n got en mycket liten sj lvupptagen och urusel yrkesgrupp vill ha finansierat varf r inte inf ra skatt p p tvingat ny rsfyrverkeri alla betalar det men bara ett f tal vill se el ndet
4193030 man kan inte ge vissa medier gr ddfil med beskattningsr tt svt konkurrerar med privata mediebolag och skall d rf r konkurrera med lika villkor redan nu b r de privata medierna anm la saken till eu domstolen
4193031 13 procent betalar inte och d sl s det p trumman det betyder ju ocks att 87 procent faktiskt betalar r inte det en ganska stor siffra sj lvklart vore det ju bra om 100 procent betalade men r det m jligt verhuvudtaget fr gar jag mig
4193032 det finns v l inte n gon i landet som aldrig tittat p tv att betala skatt inneb r ju inte att att man m ste f tillbaka varje krona f r egen privat del men det r det v l m nga som gl mt i det nya egosamh llet

4193101 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4193109 i have a heart condition and need a big operation but i have not been allowed to see him before he goes
4193110 we are russian so living in uzbekistan was difficult especially as it is a muslim country and we are christian

4193133 i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood
4193134 i wouldnt change my past because its groomed me to be the man i am today people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it
4193135 ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry therere a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the business man
4193136 i am happy here and i get to play with other children now i miss my mum but i dont want to see my dad

4193138 weve been at the forefront of getting programs operational and weve recycled now hundreds of tonnes of electronics
4193139 there is currently no comprehensive strategy to address electronic waste in federal government operations
4193140 it does not address the end of life management recycling and resource recovery nor encompass the broader range of it equipment
4193141 while we cannot provide an accurate figure at this time we do know that there is a very high volume of electronic equipment generated from canadian federal government operations
4193142 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4193143 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4193144 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting
4193145 this is not something thats high on our radar screen its not something weve had a lot of complaints about
4193146 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4193147 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4193148 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4193149 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4193150 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4193151 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4193152 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4193160 interims are becoming more popular primarily because theres more availability
4193161 interims have the opportunity to pave the way and set things up so when the full time superintendent comes in theyre ready to go
4193162 in general a district prefers to hire someone full time but sometimes the circumstances are such that its not possible
4193163 the circumstances are such that the board had its hands tied
4193164 if she chase had made her intentions known a year ago the board would have had time to find a full time superintendent but when the announcement is sprung on them the right approach is to find an interim
4193165 they are still vested with the authority to make the decisions they have to make
4193166 in that situation we have to assume with his familiarity with the district that hes probably familiar with the assistants and pretty confident at their ability to carry on
4193167 the players will just have to accept what happened here and we mustnt lose sight of our future objectives the next step for them is the full national team and theres no doubt in my mind that weve gained an awful lot in terms of experience in this tournament
4193168 its a shame we couldnt bring some joy to the honduran people but you have to understand that we can learn a lot from this for the future
4193169 im getting on so for me playing in the olympics is just something i can be proud of for them though its another benchmark in their personal development and theyll get the benefit of it in the future

4193182 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4193183 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4193184 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that

4193186 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4193187 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4193188 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4193189 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4193190 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4193199 you fool if god existed he would keep this piece of chalk from breaking when it hit the ground

4193203 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it

4193217 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
4193218 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
4193219 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
4193220 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
4193221 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
4193222 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
4193223 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
4193224 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
4193225 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
4193226 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
4193227 brandons comments in particular contain a degree of unoriginality and stupidity that you only see in the most muttonheaded and imbecilic internet commenters
4193228 in fact ive seen him use at least a dozen variations of the word gay suffice it to say brandon mylenek is a truly stupid stupid idiot

4193293 i dont think any team in any sport is unbeatable
4193294 we felt that the greek team can beat us and thats the way we approach every game
4193295 dont confuse this game as being not a tight game
4193296 today was difficult i think the next game we play will be different maybe after five six nights you can see something different
4193297 for the first time in history there is now scientific evidence that reading fiction has psychological benefits
4193298 what youre doing when youre reading fiction is youre allowing yourself to become another person for a short period of time it loosens up your personality your rigidities
4193299 youve probably all seen the way children imitate things to understand them theyll pretend to roll out a pie crust right along with you they make noises and pretend to change gears as you drive this happens in your brain too when we see someone pick up a bottle a whole set of nerve fibers called mirror neurons pretend to be picking up the bottle too whether actually picking up the bottle or just watching someone do it those neurons fire in the same pattern your body understands intimately how it feels so when i shift grip your brain shifts grip too and these mirror neurons are hooked into your limbic system to the part of your brain that handles emotions so your brain knows what it means when im turning the bottle like that you know deep down in that intuitive part of you whats going on in a way that your conscious mind probably doesnt
4193300 you can look it up when you go home for now think of the mirror neurons as recreating the experience of others inside ourselves they put us in the shoes of those others we feel others actions and sensations in our own cortex in our own body as though we ourselves are having those sensations doing those things in a very real way we are doing those things think of your mirror neurons your hunches your intuition as a powerful advisor an interpreter

4193305 we took care of what we needed to take care of we had that game in the back of our minds and we did what we had to do from beginning to the end the way we approached this game mentally we really wanted to get after them

4193312 al qaeda in iraq in some ways is a victim of its own success
4193313 it was so bloody so violent it was so nihilistic in its approach that it was bound to create some kind of counterreaction
4193314 in my judgment al qaeda is at least as dangerous as it was in 2001 because it survived a global counterterrorism offensive by every intelligence service in the world
4193315 and its still standing and its still issuing orders to its followers and its still engaging in terrorism on a global stage
4193316 bin laden in particular has become a symbol of this groups ability to survive despite everything that has been thrown against it
4193317 the fact that he is still out there almost seven years after september 11th is a powerful rallying cry for this organization
4193318 now the loss of al qaeda in iraq as an effective organization has definitely hurt al qaeda but i dont think its a deadly blow because the al qaeda core is still rebuilding operating with virtual impunity in pakistan
4193319 a number of al qaeda senior leaders went to the pakistani tribal areas and went about embedding themselves in tribal society
4193320 several major plots against the west have been planned in pakistan
4193321 some of these militants are being trained for missions against the west last year there were 29 training camps in pakistan this year its about 100
4193322 it would have outdone september 11th if not in terms of total casualties certainly in terms of total terror
4193323 think of al qaeda as if it was a global business organization
4193324 you have the ceo and the headquarters based in pakistan then you have franchises based around the muslim world
4193325 but they do things on behalf of this whole al qaeda social movement thats kind of linked up by a very simple ideology namely that the west is at war against islam
4193326 the social movement that the old al qaeda has been able to inspire has increased dramatically and that movement is fairly disconnected
4193327 its a self generating group of wannabes who want to do things on behalf of al qaeda but have not been able to link up
4193328 a lot of the interactivity takes place in chat rooms or in forums on the internet
4193329 what you have are really these spontaneous self organizing groups everywhere in the world that are kind of disconnected from al qaeda central but it doesnt matter because they get the message over the internet
4193330 it has to have some sort of central glue it has to have somebody that can connect operatives from morocco to financiers from saudi arabia with ideologues in other countries with other capabilities
4193331 and al qaedas central leadership is the only terrorist organization out there thats shown the capability to be the kind of glue that connects these disparate elements
4193332 al qaeda as it thinks about attacking america wants to be even more spectacular than either september 11th or the failed plot in august of 2006
4193333 theyre not going to do something like shooting up a mall in the united states because they know that wouldnt be seen as of the same magnitude

4193342 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4193343 its certainly on the table we would certainly be thrilled to make it but were going to wait until the series is finished its always been a desire but weve always known that for the writers its so hard for them to actually get through the series every year that we put the film on the back burner that we would do it after the series was over and that might be as soon as next year
4193344 have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4193345 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4193346 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
4193347 its an exciting thing to be a part of we have done a read through of the first three episodes and start filming next week
4193348 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
4193349 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
4193350 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
4193351 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number
4193352 for individuals who have chronic issues this is a very unhealthy issue click to enlarge gregg miller staff photographer serious problem
4193353 i feel healthy but two years ago i broke my ankle playing soccer and since that day i had to see a doctor and to buy health insurance

4193355 i dont feel comfortable because the exam is not in my language
4193356 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
4193357 martha jones ex time traveler and now working as a doctor for a u n task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
4193358 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france
4193359 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
4193360 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4193361 we know that the high cost of fuel has put financial pressure on many seniors in the province particularly those on a fixed income
4193362 this program provides our island seniors with assistance to keep their homes warmer this winter making it easier for them to stay in their homes and communities
4193363 i could feel the cold air getting through the sides of the doors and windows in the winter and i knew they had to be replaced
4193364 the process of getting the funding was so simple and it took no time at all to get my doors replaced im really pleased
4193365 silicon and stars collide the rest will fall in line
4193366 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4193367 i am very disappointed at what has happened but i would do the same again
4193368 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt
4193369 this womans compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief
4193370 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier

4193374 dont get scared but you blacked out for a few seconds
4193375 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4193376 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4193377 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4193378 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4193379 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4193380 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4193381 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4193382 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4193383 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts
4193384 its not the marijuana thats dangerous for me its the chocolate to which i could easily become addicted again

4193391 its come into my house in the past and its getting beyond a joke
4193392 a new housing estate across the road and the ricoh arena are all pumping waste into the nearby river which puts pressure on the system and causes the drains to fill up more quickly
4193393 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things

4193491 which i believe takes the issue to a another level
4193492 she is one feisty woman and for some orthodox males such forcefulness is itself a crime against submission so cherished in islam
4193493 ms jamshir is not a lady to be messed with and she has nothing but contempt and derision for her critics if only there were more like her in the arab world
4193494 i have a lot against the sharia courts what they have done to the bahraini women is not a trivial matter for years women have been going into these courts only to be oppressed and treated unjustly we have reached the point that we say enough we have reached the breaking point
4193495 the shiites in bahrain have marriages for the purpose of mutah pleasure they bring multitudes of children into the world without thinking who grow up in the streets
4193496 its accepted for a man to marry a filipino woman a bahraini woman and a third woman from iran and then he takes two or three women in mutah marriage how many children will he have
4193497 the point is for them to live and be protected in a safe country if a woman cannot get any protection in her country cannot get any protection from the courts cannot get any protection in the marital home where will she go where will she go
4193498 is it conceivable for a grown man to have sex with an infant girl and you people tell me that the islamic sharia authorizes this
4193499 forget about the mutah lets talk about misyar what do misyar marriages mean you said that im a sunni and thats why im attacking the shiites no
4193500 misyar marriage institution in islam allowing for a lesser form of relationship between man and woman than normal marriage zawaj misyar is an official relationship between man and woman but does not involve that the two live together nor that the man is economically responsible
4193501 misyar allows the man to have a normal wife in a addition to his misyar wife s the misyar wife is expected to live with her parents and her husband can visit her according to a predetermined schedule
4193502 what does the misyar marriage mean a man marries a woman from another town and goes to her once a month he visits her he calls her his wife this kind of marriage this kind of behavior diminishes the womans honor as a human being
4193503 all her life the woman is a prisoner in her own home
4193504 you tell me why is female circumcision still practiced in the arab world why because there is no education no awareness a few days ago a four year old girl called anam died in sudan why because she was circumcised four years old and she died of blood poisoning
4193505 i am convinced that i was 100 right in everything i have done
4193506 so what even in mosques they accuse me of heresy so what you think that if they accuse me of heresy it affects me no allah will decide whether i go to paradise or to hell not them
4193507 these are the methods of the weak who gave them the right to accuse me of heresy what did they go into my heart did they see whether i pray or not or maybe its because i dont wear a veil
4193508 the charge of insulting a sharia judge during a phone call is fabricated
4193509 all these charges against me have been compiled since 2001 because of a vigil we committee organized two months ago in which we demanded the resignation of the general prosecutor
4193510 i do not care if i go to prison because we already live in a big prison i will never stop nor go silent nor give up my position
4193511 the uncodified nature of these laws gives judges the authority to render judgments according to their own reading of islamic jurisprudence
4193512 why dont more feminists support women like this and women generally in the islamic world i know jay lenos wife a liberal feminist was a pretty big advocate for women in afghanistan i just wish there were more like her
4193513 why do we only hear about this woman from memri why doesnt katie freaking couric interview her on the today show
4193514 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4193515 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4193516 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4193517 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4193518 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4193519 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4193520 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4193521 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4193522 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4193523 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america
4193524 after the state by state roll is tallied mrs clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to
4193525 so how will mrs clinton who is a superdelegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit
4193526 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4193527 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4193528 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4193529 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4193530 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4193531 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4193532 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4193533 theyre checking for blood to see if there should be an extra minor
4193534 assess a double minor penalty for all contact that causes an injury whether accidental or careless in the opinion of the referee
4193535 and start working on the new cba like now because i dont know anyone in the game who doesnt think were headed for another epic disaster
4193536 my feet are really sore from the orthotics burress said
4193537 that was the first time i ran and played with them its going to take time to get used to them and kind of break them in
4193538 if im not ill be pretty close thats when burress stated he will play in the opener even if he is not completely healed
4193539 you must give credit to liege because they were aggressive competitive and played very well
4193540 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us

4193544 it was as much a statement of triumph as it was a celebration of survival when this madawaska valley township community marked 150 years of its polish kashub heritage this weekend this was the climax of a year of events to honour the sacrifices heroism and determination of the early kashub settlers who came to this part of the ottawa valley in 1858 forming canadas first polish settlement on saturday the community known for having the most cohesive kashub community outside of poland gathered at the wilno heritage park to both officially commemorate the anniversary and to dedicate the heritage farmhouse donated to the wilno heritage society by the burchat homestead fundraising committee it was moved to the site of the park in 2006 and was renovated by volunteers

4193555 las bondades y las virtudes del proyecto de inyectar un subsidio al transporte p blico del pa s son suficientemente poderosas para que algunos senadores cambien de opini n
4193556 vamos a apostar a que el senado discuta este proyecto en su propio m rito y no se politice como se politiz en la c mara de diputados aqu hay un proyecto serio responsable
4193557 do you know ive actually had in a weird way a fantastic year to be honest we did a sell out tour which was an unbelievable experience to play the o2 you cant describe that feeling so then to roll on to this is probably one of the best years ive ever had ironically
4193558 above everything else jennifer is looking for stability and loyalty in a relationship she still is hurting from losing brad pitt to angelina jolie even after all this time
4193559 it underlines yet again the need for reform to create new good school places so that children in the less well off areas get the same opportunities as others
4193560 there will be all sorts of explanations for the differences and they wont all necessarily lie in the education provision in the regions the things that affect how young people perform in school are many and varied
4193561 they also show a good return on a decade of record investment and policies which have encouraged more young people to continue and achieve in education
4193562 these are olympian achievements and represent years of hard work and sustained effort by students and teachers alike
4193563 there was an upward trend that began a couple of years ago that has accelerated there are more candidates doing mathematics than at any time in the past its important we have people with high mathematic skills so that has to be good news
4193564 its crucial for society that we have talented mathematicians and maths is essential for science and innovation todays a grade mathematicians will soon be solving the problems of tomorrow
4193565 this is a sobering account of the failure of industrial farming small scale farmers using ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the food crisis and meet the needs of communities

4193576 who knows what will happen in a year from now
4193577 we recently benchmarked this card using 3d mark vantage and increased the graphics score from x7125 at stock settings to x8148 which represents a performance increase of well over 10
4193578 the increase in production coupled with the extraordinarily high prices was more than we anticipated during the second quarter of 2008 universal energy corp s share of production was approximately 23 58 million cubic feet of gas and 262 barrels of oil with production having started in july 2008 for caviar 1 and caviar 4 production for fiscal 2008 is shaping up nicely
4193579 allows i am on the phone and typing one handed
4193580 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4193581 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4193582 its not times square its the freeman street station in the bronx
4193583 often when i talk to people about it and show them images when i tell them where it is i feel its not necessarily likely theyll make it to that part of the bronx which is not on the beaten path for a lot of people it was certainly wonderful to get this kind of acknowledgment
4193584 i was directly involved with everything except the actual cutting of the glass i made the maquettes the scale drawings that show the pieces for me the challenge of course was to take my paintings which are normally tremendously more detailed and to reduce them to these flat patterns of solid colored pieces that still can read as a recognizable scene with depth and dimensionality the process unfolded over about a five year period
4193585 at first being completely new to this material i was reliant to a great deal on the fabricator larry gordon studios out in port washington the earlier pieces unfortunately i wasnt as happy with when we put all the pieces together thousands for each pane they were laid out flat against a wooden table and you couldnt see the light
4193586 growing up a half century ago on the subways between the bronx and harlem gave me an appreciation of how a bit of artistic beauty might give riders and workers opportunities for reflection on where they were and where they might be going it is a privilege to recognize the great stained glass work of daniel hauben who realized this dream id had of subway beautification as a source of personal contemplation
4193587 its an acknowledgment and verification of my connection to the community and a little bit of attention which every artist hopes for
4193588 we try every night to play just a little better defense
4193589 thats the key for us its much better than depending on offense
4193590 not just a few moments like we did against australia
4193591 we played with a lot of passion and very well on defense tonight
4193592 they came prepared for us and we couldnt get anything going on offense tonight
4193593 were not thinking about what happened in the past against lithuania and australia
4193594 were almost to the next round but we need to take the next two games very seriously
4193595 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4193596 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4193597 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4193598 i think that choice and gay rights are personal things particularly if you are a conservative the government should get out of the bedroom
4193599 our best chance to protect both our national security and our civil liberties
4193600 even life long civil libertarian mort halperin says this is a good bill

4193621 we finally had a big enough data set that the statistics demanded an answer it could no longer be just a coincidence
4193622 we think the yarkovsky effect is so efficient for meter size objects that it can operate on all regions of the asteroid belt
4193623 odds are an object we might have to deal with would be like an ll chondrite and thanks to our samples in the laboratory we can measure its properties in detail
4193624 but you must its my finest paella and i made it just for you

4193635 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4193636 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4193637 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4193638 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4193639 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4193640 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4193641 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4193695 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

4193798 pliny xxi 7 9 relates how cleopatra played on antonys fear of being poisoned refusing to take any food that had not been tasted sic she instead laid a garland of poisoned flowers on his head suggesting as the revelry grew wilder that they all drink their chaplets as antony began to drink from the cup into which he had scattered his flowers she stopped him a prisoner was brought in and commanded to drink dying on the spot
4193799 there have been two pearls that were the largest in the whole of history both were owned by cleopatra the last of the queens of egypt they had come down to her through the hands of the kings of the east in accordance with previous instructions the servants placed in front of her only a single vessel containing vinegar the strong rough quality of which can melt pearls she was at the moment wearing in her ears that remarkable and truly unique work of nature antony was full of curiosity to see what in the world she was going to do she took one earring off and dropped the pearl in the vinegar and when it was melted swallowed it with this goes the story that when that queen who had won on this important issue was captured the second of this pair of pearls was cut in two pieces so that half a helping of the jewel might be in each of the ears of venus in the pantheon at rome

4193808 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4193809 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4193810 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated

4193816 man kann nicht sagen dass es mehr tornados geben wird es kann sogar sein dass es weniger werden aber wom glich werden sie schwerer
4193817 vermutlich wird es in den n chsten 10 bis 20 jahren noch keinen mittleren anstieg geben aber danach ab 2030 deutet sich ein trend an dass es besonders heftige jahre und dann wieder besonders ruhige jahre geben k nnte
4193818 derzeit gibt es in den beobachtungszahlen weltweit nirgendwo einen trend dass es mehr schwere tornados gibt die zahlen aus den usa f r die drei h chsten tornadostufen f3 bis f5 sind fast genauso hoch wie vor 80 jahren

4193828 according to our free media the georgians didnt invade the land of the ossetians they merely tried to retake it as a child would bloodlessly and even quite playfully retake a shiny red ball from a playmate those evil russkies on the other hand attack on georgia at least those are the words our reporters are using

4193853 i found this arresting chart on swivel it plots the number of bloggers who have been incarcerated over the past few years based on data collected by the world information access project the number of incidents it tracks went from five arrests in 2003 to 35 last year as blogging expands internationally so do the risk of speaking one s mind something many of us take for granted

4193871 an electromagnetic pulse emp attack on the american homeland said one of the distinguished scientists who testified at the hearing is one of only a few ways that the united states could be defeated by its enemies terrorist or otherwise
4193872 and it is probably the easiest a single scud missile carrying a single nuclear weapon detonated at the appropriate altitude would interact with the earths atmosphere producing an electromagnetic pulse radiating down to the surface at the speed of light depending on the location and size of the blast the effect would be to knock out already stressed power grids and other electrical systems across much or even all of the continental united states for months if not years

4193886 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4193887 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4193888 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4193889 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4193890 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4193891 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4193892 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4193893 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4193894 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4193895 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4193896 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4193897 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4193898 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4193899 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4193900 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4193901 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4193902 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4193903 it is not easy to turn around the existing forces by 180 degrees
4193904 de facto territorial integrity of georgia is limited because of the conflict
4193905 this problem can be solved only through the search for mutual solutions
4193906 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4193907 why would one attack them unless there is some other purpose
4193908 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4193909 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4193910 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4193911 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4193912 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4193913 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4193914 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4193915 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4193916 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4193917 either support for a virtual project or real partnership with russia on issues that demand collective action
4193918 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4193919 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4193920 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4193921 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4193922 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4193923 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4193924 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4193925 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4193926 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
4193927 looting burning villages and killings of civilians that are in areas under russian control
4193928 this causes great concern as it is not clear whose orders the russian troops are executing and why russia does not honour the declared ceasefire
4193929 a vast mission of peacekeepers observers and other monitors who will record the illegal actions by russian troops
4193930 georgias territorial integrity and the withdrawal of the occupation army must be the main objectives to be pursued by the international community after military actions are discontinued
4193931 serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
4193932 in a major escalation of the conflict with russia over georgia president george w
4193933 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4193934 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4193935 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4193936 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4193937 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
4193938 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
4193939 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
4193940 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
4193941 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
4193942 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
4193943 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4193944 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
4193945 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
4193946 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went

4194018 no existe un sistema de justicia militar la justicia militar es una sola establecida en la constituci n y quienes la componen el poder ejecutivo no forma parte de este sistema de justicia militar exactamente pasa lo mismo con la contralor a cuando la constituci n del 99 establece el poder ciudadano tanto el ministerio p blico como la contralor a forman parte de un poder aut nomo e independiente
4194019 hay tres art culos que tienen que ver con el cambio de nombre la constituci n establece que la fuerza armada tiene cuatro componentes que se llaman ej rcito armada aviaci n y guardia nacional gn y no establece que se llaman bolivarianos esos art culos fueron introducidos en la reforma constitucional y fueron negados de acuerdo con la propia constituci n no puede ser esa iniciativa
4194020 sobre el grado de militar del presidente de la rep blica dice la constituci n que tiene la categor a de comandante en jefe de la fuerza armada y no el grado se mismo art culo implica una cantidad de ambig edades que van contra la propia constituci n por ejemplo si el presidente de la rep blica es comandante en jefe de la fuerza armada en situaci n de actividad c mo l se va a reelegir como presidente si la propia constituci n proh be que un militar activo sea candidato

4194028 mccains worth over 100 million he owns 10 houses he flies around on a 12 6 million corporate jet he walks around in 520 loafers if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine would you

4194032 nashville fan sent thursday august 14 2008 12 52 pm
4194033 here im saying clearly i oppose barack obama and the book is designed to lay this information out and let the american public decide
4194034 he was registered as a muslim the documentation i thoroughly researched it from the indonesian newspapers and indonesian television he attended mosque with his stepfather
4194035 the friends who were in school with him attest that he was then considered a muslim and thats the testimony of the people in indonesia who grew up in those six years
4194036 right now vile smear peddler jerome corsi is back with a new book of lies this time about barack obama well need the combined efforts of every member of the action wire to push back against this years vicious republican attack book
4194037 together well show corsi and the right wing smear machine that we wont back down from a fight
4194038 if you get one of these e mails that says im a muslim not true that never been a muslim this is just stuff that is designed to make people suspicious
4194039 obamas mother chose another third world prospect for her second husband a second man of color to be her mate
4194040 i stated they were not written to express my true views they were intentionally written to be antagonistic or aggressive or provocative the catholic church im a good member i was born and raised in the catholic church
4194041 you cant take a few quips that ive wrote that ive apologized for that should not have been written and i have not done again to be representative of my beliefs and writing
4194042 i dont think anybodys going to take jerome corsi all that seriously once they learn who this guy really is even people on the right wing havent associated themselves with him because of some of the pretty bigoted and outrageous things hes said in his career
4194043 now four years later he has come out with another book that is also riddled with distortions and falsehoods so the question is why on earth would anyone listen to what he has to say about barack obama
4194044 ive written against john mccain very strongly for the last four years on his immigration policy i wrote a series of articles in world net daily of john mccains connections with george soros the book is not written to support john mccain i am constitution party i make it very clear in the introduction ill be voting for chuck baldwin of the constitution party
4194045 this book is a legitimately published book its published with the investigative research in this book that is not being touched here all thats happening is im getting called names its an ad hominem attack
4194046 he could learn a lot from burns because he was a great social satirist hes got tonnes of skills that paxman could only dream of in terms of interrogating humanity
4194047 although i am afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state
4194048 we all know he likes to poke fun at scotland so we allowed the forward to stand its not our place to censor him
4194049 i think we are strong enough as a nation to take it on the chin

4194053 son leyes inconsultas que no fueron sometidas a la discusi n en un madrugonazo jur dico dieron este paquetazo
4194054 quiero hacer un llamado de conciencia a los factores de la sociedad venezolana en el caso espec fico del distrito metropolitano para que entendamos que s lo a trav s de un proceso primario tendremos un candidato unitario con todas las posibilidades de vencer el 23 de noviembre
4194055 que se empe aron en sustituir los mecanismos democr ticos directos por mecanismos enrevesados que nos han llevado a 8 meses en el limbo sin saber qu va a suceder y dando se ales muy malas porque la confrontaci n incluso al interno de esos partidos demostr que lo que menos le interesaba era la unidad
4194056 los factores que hacemos frente a la posici n hegem nica del presidente de la rep blica y del gobierno somos tres no es uno s lo y en la pol tica justamente se trabaja con la visi n de trascendencia cuando se plantea superar dificultades la dificultad no se puede superar aplicando una pol tica de hecho cumplido en base a intereses min sculos en este caso hay que tratar de que se tenga una oportunidad a trav s de una consulta directa y la nica manera que avizoro es por el proceso primario
4194057 la exigencia ciudadana porque nos pongamos a trabajar ya no en lo individual y haciendo un esfuerzo distinto sino en lo colectivo y de manera coordinada me parece que debe ser atendida sin condici n alguna sin poner ning n tipo de reglas y sin tratar de aplicar alg n tipo de agenda en lo individual sino responder con total sensibilidad apertura y disposici n toda vez que es una demanda justa y justificada que debe ser atendida por todos los rdenes de gobierno y de autoridad
4194058 recuperar la seguridad del pa s es un tema prioritario que no debe ser delegable hacia abajo sino atendido por las propias cabezas y de manera permanente la coordinaci n para alcanzar un entendimiento com n es clave para dar resultados en la capital del pa s o en cualquier estado de la rep blica

4194066 no one else has their own off site factory where they make the rooms from scratch and send them across the world
4194067 we really wanted an a1 location for the hotel because we like to be near all the cultural attractions wherever we are based
4194068 the fact that an innovative company like citizenm has chosen glasgow to open one of its first hotels outside holland shows that despite short term pressures the city continues to have a strong reputation as both a short stay tourist and conference destination
4194069 social engineering seems just as effective as it was 10 years ago

4194087 by the time any user was notified that facebook was at a minimum an observing party to the transaction and that facebook was asking for an approval to publicly broadcast identifying information regarding the event personally identifying information had already been communicated to facebook

4194089 we recognize that nac is very complicated because its one of those interesting techs thats very broad and very deep

4194160 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4194161 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4194162 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing

4194170 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4194171 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

4194178 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

4194202 while the dedicated men and women of ice endeavor to carry out their dangerous and noble missions you somehow felt compelled to characterize their efforts as something akin to terrorizing

4194223 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
4194224 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

4194255 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviors that we see in whole organisms
4194256 this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviors but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions

4194272 the younger voters coming on line tend to be postmodern theologically to the extent they are theological at all and tend to lean leftward in their politics
4194273 i think what is diminishing is a secular approach to politics and whats arising is a faith based approach to politics and now i think we have the opportunity in this country for the great debate between a right leaning limited government low taxes anti abortion type of faith based politics and then the more left leaning version of that on the other side
4194274 as a christian i have written a book about another mans faith and im intrigued by his faith
4194275 i want to encourage his faith and i believe he is sincere about his faith now people who share my political vies are upset with me because i have written this book and basically what they are saying is you are too christian you should be more republican than you are christian what i have written is an honest objective evaluation that celebrates faith to the extent it can be celebrated questioned it where it had to be questioned and basically tries to explain it in terms of our times which is something we need by the way as we approach this election
4194276 i have to say that one of my goals for this book besides just the content was to find the tone that i hope will be replicated a bit more in american politics
4194277 this vicious left right fighting that is happening in america is paralyzing us it is keeping up from accomplishing anything and i have to say as a christian it is ungodly my hope was to write a book that would model a certain tone while communicating facts that people need to know

4194298 the united states is now accepting musharrafs removal as a fait accompli
4194299 they just want that he should not be humiliated we dont want his humiliation either
4194300 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against mr musharraf
4194301 with one voice they said this is the time you have to be with the democratic forces

4194305 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4194306 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4194307 obama refrained from raising clintons stinking past in the white house

4194309 michigan and florida did not count get over it your party made the rules follow the rules unless you are hillary right
4194310 some clinton backers had said they would leave the convention after clinton speaks on tuesday night as part of an ongoing protest against obamas nomination
4194311 hillary clintons name will symbolically be placed into nomination at the democratic national convention but then she will quickly turn her delegates over to barack obama and cast her superdelegate vote for him
4194312 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4194313 im sorry to all the american people im sorry i lied about my indonesian citizenship im sorry i have set race relations back 50 years
4194314 i hate to burst your bubble but obama won the popular vote
4194315 counting obama as having zero votes in michigan might put hillary on top
4194316 but it ignores the 40 who voted to send undeclared delegates to the convention
4194317 those were obama votes since his name wasnt on the ballot

4194332 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4194333 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4194334 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4194335 100 billion dollars is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion dollars in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4194336 i think advocates of unaccountable privatisation are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatisation of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances of contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness

4194341 moreover they the central asian republics are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors namely russia turkey and iran with china also signaling an increasing political interest in the region
4194342 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4194343 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4194344 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4194345 although personnel counts are rough approximations cbo estimates that as of early 2008 at least 190 000 contractor personnel including subcontractors were working on us funded contracts in the iraq theater
4194346 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4194347 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4194348 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4194349 whether you are bob kearns or gandhi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4194350 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4194351 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4194352 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4194353 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity

4194360 youll know it when you will see us leaving not before
4194361 good morning ive just met with my national security team to discuss the crisis in georgia ive spoken with president saakashvili of georgia and president sarkozy of france this morning
4194362 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement that will end this conflict
4194363 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4194364 russia has stated that changing the government of georgia is not its goal the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
4194365 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
4194366 were concerned about reports that russian units have taken up positions on the east side of the city of gori which allows them to block the east to west highway divide the country and threaten the capital of tbilisi
4194367 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armored vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russia is blowing up georgian vessels
4194368 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
4194369 with these concerns in mind i have directed a series of steps to demonstrate our solidarity with the georgian people and bring about a peaceful resolution to this conflict
4194370 im sending secretary of state condoleezza rice to france where she will confer with president sarkozy
4194371 ive also directed secretary of defense bob gates to begin a humanitarian mission to the people of georgia headed by the united states military this mission will be vigorous and ongoing
4194372 a us c 17 aircraft with humanitarian supplies is on its way
4194373 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4194374 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4194375 as i have made clear russias ongoing action raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
4194376 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4194377 on the risk of stocks in the long run a resolution to the debate
4194378 on the risk of stocks in the long run a comment
4194379 it is obviously quite difficult to predict how much an insurance company would charge for an rcla
4194380 we have developed a theoretical model for valuing an rcla assuming a number of idealized assumptions
4194381 that said we have developed a theoretical model for valuing an rcla assuming a number of idealized assumptions these are the same assumptions that are used to price and hedge widely available equity put options as well as generic life annuities which is why we believe the model values provide a rough indication of what an rcla would cost in reality
4194382 option based cost may appear higher than a simple insurance cost

4194387 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and to the zone of conflict towards south ossetia
4194388 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4194389 when the russians come across an abandoned georgian military installation they are not leaving them as is
4194390 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4194391 they clearly had a great advantage in having superior air power and a lot of force that they were able to bring to bear
4194392 my own view is that its a strange thing but since 2004 every august there has been an exchange of fire between the south ossetians and the georgians this year it escalated very quickly and it seemed to me that the russians were prepared to take advantage of a situation and did so very aggressively
4194393 punish georgia for rather more than their part in the annual exchange of fire but for daring to try to integrate with the west
4194394 signal to the rest of the former soviet union against trying to move out of the russian sphere of influence
4194395 they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4194396 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4194397 it is a pity however that the american side steadfastly refuses to recognise the real reason for what happened
4194398 that the regime of mikheil saakashvili in violation of all of its international obligations launched a war against the south ossetian people
4194399 i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4194400 i have maintained from the first descriptions of the material contained in the daschle letter that the quality appeared to be such that it could be produced only by some group that was involved with a current or former in recent years the level of knowledge expertise and experience required and the types of special equipment required to make such quality product takes time and experimentation to develop further the nature of the finished dried product is such that safety equipment and facilities must be used to protect the individuals involved and to shield their clandestine activity from discovery
4194401 you would need a chemist who is familiar with colloidal fumed silica and a material science person to put it all together and then some mechanical engineers to make this work probably some containment people if you dont want to kill anybody you need half a dozen i think really smart people
4194402 the statement should have had a reference an unsupported sentence being cited as fact is uncomfortable to me any statement in a scientific article should be supported by a reference or by documentation
4194403 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4194404 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
4194405 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4194406 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

4194415 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class

4194425 judgments will be made about how we handled this situation and approached the situation in iraq and how much experience knowledge and background means in selecting who should be the next commander in chief all i can say is there will be plenty of time for that and we can move forward

4194449 i hadnt expected nick to pick me but if i just miss out by a few euros after playing well for the next three weeks maybe he will

4194481 the marketplace is looking forward to the fact that energy and commodity prices have come down substantially

4194486 there are four or five generals and admirals we know of who would resign if bush ordered an attack on iran
4194487 there is simply no stomach for it in the pentagon and a lot of people question whether such an attack would be effective or even possible
4194488 all the generals are perfectly clear that they dont have the military capacity to take iran on in any meaningful fashion nobody wants to do it and it would be a matter of conscience for them
4194489 there are enough people who feel this would be an error of judgment too far for there to be resignations

4194500 forgetting that atheism is the lack of belief not a belief in anything
4194501 it also make one wonder why the daily mail gave such a poor thinker all that space to take on dawkins
4194502 his the twilight of atheism for example had as its main only thesis the ridiculous claim that everyone living in eastern europe was an atheist until the berlin wall came down whereupon they all promptly became christians
4194503 this is the level of genius exhibited by theologians like mcgrath little wonder that dawkins doubts that theology is even a subject let alone a subject worth debating
4194504 just like his hero cs lewis alister mcgrath has no answer to the criticisms made of religion by sober minded atheists the best he can come up with is most people believe there is a god so there must be
4194505 like other great scientists he does not fit the boxes in which popular polemicists like to pigeonhole him
4194506 it is clear for example that he had respect for the religious values enshrined within judaic and christian traditions but what he understood by religion was something far more subtle than what is usually meant by the word in popular discussion
4194507 my big brother says x and hes a by gosh real scientist so you better shut up
4194508 it makes me think of the simpsons episode where homer after getting a crayon extracted from his brain becomes super intelligent and writes a mathematical proof for the non existence of god and gives it to flanders who sets fire to it after realising its validity so it doesnt get out

4194510 in sarcasm ridicule or mockery is used harshly often crudely and contemptuously for destructive purposes
4194511 despite his categorical rejection of conventional religion brooke said that einstein became angry when his views were appropriated by evangelists for atheism he was offended by their lack of humility
4194512 i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it
4194513 i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings
4194514 yes but just because someone is smart in one field doesnt mean they have any special insight into another field
4194515 despite his categorical rejection of conventional religion brooke said that einstein became angry when his views were appropriated by evangelists for atheism he was offended by their lack of humility
4194516 o ne of the countrys leading experts on the scientist
4194517 such concepts as are directly and intuitively connected with typical complexes of sense experiences
4194518 they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power
4194519 einstein was smart and he was an atheist so you should follow his lead
4194520 by killing the jews i am doing the work of the lord
4194521 he was simply not compelled by any reason or logic to believe in any of the gods or religions that had thus far been conceived
4194522 science is often as inexact and intuitive as theology philosophy and every other human endeavor science is not governed by absolute immutable laws i think hedges means reality here rather than science the new atheist writers from richard dawkins to e o wilson to sam harris have become the high priests not of science but the cult of science e o wilson is not a new atheist but a conciliatory atheist reaching out to people of faith science limited to what can be proved and disproved is a morally neutral discipline there are times when it empowers ambitions that are immoral and deadly evolutionary science swiftly became for many a surrogate religion it was used to promote racism and pseudo science such as eugenics the atheists continue to create moral hierarchies among human beings and use these hierarchies to sanction violence there is nothing in science that implies that our genetic makeup allows us to perfect ourselves those who in the name of science claim that we can overcome our imperfect human nature make a leap of faith

4194553 having a mental health problem is a difficult and frightening experience to complicate matters people with mental health problems often experience discrimination stigma and social exclusion both by other people in society who do not understand mental illness and by professionals such as psychiatrists nurses and social workers who require more patient centred and appropriate training and education on key issues in mental health there is a reliance within mental health on the prescription of powerful antipsychotic and pharmaceutical medication with little recourse to alternative and less invasive treatments in some circumstances medication can be forcibly administered to people with mental health problems against their wishes and consent more recently there has been a growth in research and psychiatric understanding outlining alternative methods for coping with mental health problems such as hearing voices in this alternative and modern approach symptoms such as hearing voices are discussed and related to peoples experiences rather than discounted as delusions and falsehoods the voice hearing experience is accepted so as to be listened to and discussed in relation to peoples histories and personal stories it is imperative that we take account of the experiences of people with mental health problems so as to provide more patient centred humane holistic collaborative and human rights based mental health care there are five chief recommendations in order to begin such a collaborative and listening process 1 alternative approaches to mental illness should be thoroughly covered in mental health training and education by professionals such as psychiatrists nurses and social workers the work of romme and escher and others involved in the hearing voices movement outlines such alternative and effective approaches to conventional interventions 2 in order for professionals to engage empathise and effectively collaborate with people with mental health problems in their practice there should be training and education programmes available to professionals that are run by people who have experienced mental health problems experience is often said to be the greatest teacher experience is expertise listening to the experiences of people with mental health problems will provide professionals from the health social care and voluntary sectors with a broader and more empathetic perspective as well as opening up the pathway to more holistic and democratic care 3 the use of advance agreements or advance directives with people who have mental health problems should be encouraged so as to open up more democratic pathways of treatment and care in collaboration with mental health teams and consultant psychiatrists the use of advance agreements enables the person with mental health issues when they are stable and well to stipulate their preferred method of treatment at a future date when considered unwell or mentally ill 4 to ensure full collaboration as well as consistent and humane care a person who has experienced mental health problems should be appointed to all mental health tribunals this will ensure that the person with mental health problems is better represented legally and ethically by a peer 5 a review of the efficacy debilitating side effects and alternatives to medical treatment should be conducted in order to begin to assess new and less invasive methods of helping people to cope more insightfully with mental illness the key aim is to place the person with mental health problems and their experiences at the forefront and centre of mental health care ensure their human and medical rights give them a democratic say in their care and consider new and innovative methods for coping more insightfully with mental illness
4194554 from the phones antenna and amplifier and the radio frequency transceiver to the baseband that processes the digital signal and sends it to the speaker or screen
4194555 apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available
4194556 the philosophy of materialism holds that the only things that can be truly proven to exist is matter fundamentally material composes all things and all phenomena are the result of material interactions therefore matter is the only substance and can neither be created or destroyed hence we are all made of only what came before us yet discretely conceived through form we are all made of earth and sky and stars
4194557 6 errores comunes que te est n costando dinero en tu sitio web
4194558 she didnt want people to think she was a klutz
4194559 when the doctor checked with the hospital several hours later and the family hadnt showed up he threatened her over the phone and allen took the newborn to the hospital where an exam found two skull fractures and four broken ribs calling the childs health critical
4194560 after each of these versions medical personnel said that her explanation couldnt account for the nature and severity of the childs injuries
4194561 when asked why didnt she tell someone she said she didnt want people to think she was a klutz
4194562 medical personnel tell us that the childs condition is guarded and that she isnt going to die but that the prognosis for full mental and physical recovery isnt good
4194563 we use the greenbox in both 9 inch and 12 inch cube versions for refrigerated controlled room temperature shipments to alaska and hawaii
4194564 we have begun to use each size in a variety of states for room temperature shipments we continue to use eps expanded polystyrene corrugated overpack units for the bulk of our shipments
4194565 julian carroll managing director for the european organization for packaging and the environment www europen be noted during last septembers sustainable packaging forum in pittsburgh that one of the weaknesses in the wal mart sustainability initiative was that its focus was confined to packaging that remained in custody and excluded packaging that remained with the consumer we feel that the greenbox provides a practical solution to bridging this gap
4194566 irrespective of the model of use whether its rented on a per use basis or purchased and returned to a reclamation center no transit packaging is left with the consumer to dispose of
4194567 however it does allow us to save relative to shipping charges by shifting from priority overnight or standard overnight rates to second and third day rates he adds
4194568 and in the case of controlled room temperature shipments it yields savings compared with ground transport rates
4194569 the major benefit of their phase change materials beyond excellent performance is that they are vegetable oil based not propylene glycol based that removes a potential hazard from the packaging relative to spills leakage and environmental contamination the greenbox construction to date performs as advertised it is robust
4194570 wal mart will continue to expand its use of greenbox in a number of controlled trials to test
4194571 a drop out rate of greater than five percent would be unsuitable by and large eps corrugated combinations are a one time only use proposition
4194572 first james soucey has been very proactive in seeking a better way to get prescriptions to wmsp customers and the wal mart green initiative has led industries with its internal environmental scorecards as it holds people and their vendors accountable
4194573 the whole area of biopharmaceuticals and biological products creates an enormous challenge for end user companies in that the products are so fragile and sensitive
4194574 one of the big challenges for those manufacturers is that the industry has always had two temperature ranges available to them frozen and the two degree to eight degree celsius range so if a company was developing anything outside that range the only way to transport it was in a refrigerator that needed people to accompany the shipment
4194575 the baby boom population is getting older insurance companies are pressuring people to get out of hospitals
4194576 the area of home infusion is really growing people are leaving hospitals and they may still be on iv treatments or using injectable drugs so now those drugs need to go directly to consumers homes pharmaceutical distributors and other companies are even beginning to specialize in this area
4194577 we have not actually used it to ship any blood product yet but it is in the validation mode
4194578 validation means that mbc needs to test every blood component at minimum and maximum levels at every temperature situation
4194579 the validation is labor and time intensive but i would hope we would complete the process by the end of 2008
4194580 the nurse was her own double check but we knew that visual checks didnt work all the time especially for feeds because theyre very repetitive
4194581 we do anywhere from 8 000 to 10 000 feeds a month so when you have that many at some point you look at your feed and see exactly what you need to see not whats written there
4194582 its emotional for these mothers because theyre already upset about their babys condition
4194583 its very easy to work with and they wanted this technology because they didnt want to make errors
4194584 a lot of it you cant quantify such as the emotional cost we conducted follow ups with parents involved in breast milk errors and they all felt the same way they didnt trust us much afterward lactrack has helped improve satisfaction with families because we have decreased the risk of a breast milk error occurring by 99 9 percent
4194585 you defended your land and justice was on your side
4194586 that is why you won with the assistance of russian peacekeepers i think that is an appropriate outcome
4194587 give the gamers what the need not what they want

4194603 ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik het gevecht tegen dat beeld beter aankan als ik mijn kamerlidmaatschap neerleg ik heb graag mijn handen vrij
4194604 ik moet constateren dat dit nieuwe zeer ernstige gegeven mij in de beeldvorming verder terug de jaren tachtig heeft ingezogen

4194624 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4194625 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests in india against the touring england squad which will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings the ipl finalists to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4194626 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january

4194645 but seriously we will have to deal with it in a personal way we can watch 1000 videos of what he does but it is up to the individual to play him on the turf it depends on your frame of mind

4194647 but cricket goes on the youngsters will have to prove they are good enough whenever this scenario has happened in indian cricket somebody has accepted responsibility sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket you dont often get loads of runs when batting it can be crucial
4194648 there are a few things that we need to assess
4194649 ive always been saying that confidence shouldnt go up and down with the performance you have to stay positive always
4194650 it is always a different game and we have different game plans for handling india
4194651 its a young side and we are grooming a young group of guys to take over we are looking to the little things well as individuals thats been our emphasis and i think thats what has contributed to our improvement over that period

4194656 first the waiting time was less than a year and then they extended it several times now we have a view to have a child next spring but we have learned not to hope too much
4194657 there is barely a day that i do not surf the discussion forum for families in the same situation as we are
4194658 at the same time we must see it as a positive thing that the adoptions countries have better resources to take care of the children says jonna salmela senior adviser on adoption council governed by the ministry
4194659 the essential point is that the meaning of all things is colored by subjectivity and that for a philosophy or ideology to pretend full objectivity is not only deceptive but also in some cases politically abusive
4194660 that postmodern skepticism appears similar to relativism or even nihilism
4194661 christianity may be true for you but its not true for me
4194662 it certainly beats the usual crisps and beer riders from other bands if the girls are keen to fill out their figures this will have them piling on the pounds in no time
4194663 russians treasured the fact they had a monopoly on oil and gas pipelines from central asia as it gave them considerable clout
4194664 by agreeing to having an oil pipeline georgia made itself more vulnerable
4194665 this has clearly demonstrated robert mugabes insincerity and lack of commitment to this process
4194666 communicated with the zimbabwean authorities about the need for them to do everything possible to ensure that the mdc delegation is allowed to travel to south africa and the zimbabwean authorities have agreed with that

4194676 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4194677 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4194678 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4194679 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4194680 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4194681 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4194682 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4194683 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4194684 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4194685 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe
4194686 we know that 70 of americans believe we should exploit our own resources dont believe when people say that the energy prices wont go down when we allow drilling they will go down
4194687 we are to coal what saudi arabia is to oil
4194688 we have not built a new refinery in 30 years because of the regulations
4194689 drilling is prohibited in 97 of our offshore waters we are smart enough as americans to do it in an environmentally safe way
4194690 drilling isnt everything but in the next 10 15 years we will continue to be dependent on gas we need to realize that
4194691 we are the greatest nation in the world because we always depended on ourselves to do our best the american energy act will allow us to rely on ourselves so that we can continue to be the best country in the world

4194799 after having been an occupied nation for over 150 years we have asked the united states government to leave our country meanwhile until the united states government leaves lakotah territory we will take every opportunity to insist it follow its own laws and that its states do the same
4194800 according to the civil right act federal marshalls should arrest any state official who tries to stop lakotah from entering the park and fishing however if the united states ignores its own laws to deny lakotah rights it will certainly not be the first time
4194801 it is however understood that in making this recognition and acknowledgement the aforesaid indian nations do not surrender the privilege of hunting fishing or passing over any of the tracts of country heretofore described
4194802 it is hereby expressly understood and agreed by and between the respective parties to this treaty that the execution of this treaty and its ratification by the united states senate shall have the effect and shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into between the respective parties hereto so far as such treaties and agreements obligate the united states to furnish and provide money clothing or other articles of property to such indians and bands of indians as become parties to this treaty but no further

4194819 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4194820 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4194821 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
4194822 hopes for a deal between robert mugabe and opposition leader morgan tsvangarai that would resolve the crisis in zimbabwe are slipping away yesterday mugabe stated he would form a government and would open parliament next week if southern african leaders who hold a summit this weekend reject mugabes attempt to hold onto power and stand by the will of the people of zimbabwe a political solution is possible the key to influencing these leaders are their citizens and trade unionists we can join with thousands of them who will be marching on saturday outside the summit by raising a red card calling for mugabe to go your red card will be held up at the summit march
4194823 we sat down in a group this week and talked about responsibility
4194824 the players led it we wanted them to what the squad has been through cannot happen again the players know that
4194825 it was clear to all the coaches that the players understood the situation and are very keen to make amends
4194826 what happened doesnt reflect the calibre of the people in the squad but its done now and we have to deal with it
4194827 weve had a couple of really good meetings thats part of the process of being a team
4194828 we dont think four days and two meetings makes everything all right
4194829 its an everyday process for all these guys and ourselves
4194830 its all about being successful and we dont want the headlines weve had this year on a couple of occasions that makes it difficult for us to operate
4194831 were not doing these things to appease the media were doing it because we think its the right way to be a successful team
4194832 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
4194833 this is an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
4194834 we applaud tyra banks and tv network the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
4194835 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
4194836 would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate
4194837 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4194838 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4194839 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4194840 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4194841 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4194842 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4194843 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4194844 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4194845 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4194846 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4194847 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4194848 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4194849 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4194850 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4194851 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4194852 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4194853 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4194854 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4194855 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4194856 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4194857 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4194858 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4194859 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4194860 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4194861 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4194862 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4194863 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4194864 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4194865 ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik het gevecht tegen dat beeld beter aankan als ik mijn kamerlidmaatschap neerleg ik heb graag mijn handen vrij
4194866 ik moet constateren dat dit nieuwe zeer ernstige gegeven mij in de beeldvorming verder terug de jaren tachtig heeft ingezogen
4194867 ik heb dat nooit geweten en ik heb daar nooit aan meegedaan maar ik veroordeel dit soort acties ten strengste
4194868 before georgias aggression talks with georgia were possible but now there will be no talks with georgia
4194869 it is not for uncle sam to decide on this not for europe but for the people themselves
4194870 despite the attack on the people of south ossetia our will and desire to achieve independence did not change
4194871 you defended your land and justice was on your side that is why you won with the assistance of russian peacekeepers a reinforced peacekeeping contingent
4194872 please be aware that russias position is unchanged we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia and not only do we support them but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world
4194873 we mainly discussed the sixth point which talks about russian guarantees
4194874 you know when we talk about the sixth point the point about the status i want you to know and to tell the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia that russias position is unchanged
4194875 we have a de facto situation in which people in south ossetia and abkhazia simply do not want to live within the same state with a man who sent troops against them
4194876 they remain subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations
4194877 because they are active members and contributing to the support network for karadzic
4194878 they are part of a network that has been the subject of ongoing criminal investigations for many years
4194879 with their bank accounts ordered frozen five years ago how is it that theyve come to live with no visible means of support all this time
4194880 they have multiple properties they take vacations in montenegro they travel to belgrade how no money no jobs they dont pay income tax they have cash in their house they cant explain how it gets there
4194881 karadzic as has been proven to be the case and mladic remain within the reach of serbian authorities and always have been
4194882 mladic is probably the hardest target there is and i think bringing him to justice will be very difficult it could take a week it could take a month it could take a year
4194883 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4194884 this has been very very difficult for the city for the state and thats obviously why we need a resolution
4194885 the wayne county prosecutors office will be taking an emergency appeal to the state court of appeals regarding these recent orders
4194886 one of the few things we know for sure is this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
4194887 weve learned from interviews and from other investigative avenues that hes very shrewd a very skilled manipulator thats hes able to ingratiate himself with people sometimes at the upper ranks of society
4194888 he just knows that one day they werent there he doesnt know where they went or why they left
4194889 in germany he was a one off a bit crazy but he was no criminal before he left
4194890 he was very articulate a well spoken guy certainly quirky
4194891 he said he had a company in upstate new york that had thousands of square feet of facilities and that someone had made an offer to buy it for 4 billion and he refused it

4194901 chemical weapons are known as the poor mans nuclear bomb because in some cases they can be manufactured from items available in the commercial market they are easier to acquire and build than other weapons of mass destruction with the end of the cold war the natural barriers that were in place to prevent the spread of this weaponry disappeared in some cases this technology has gone on sale to the highest bidder this has increased the likelihood that american troops may encounter these weapons on the battlefield similarly these factors have made chemical weapons popular with terrorist organizations

4195209 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4195210 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4195211 one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture

4195220 kommt es im sommer zu immer heftigeren gewittern w chst das risiko sehr zerst rerischer tornados
4195221 man kann nicht sagen dass es mehr tornados geben wird es kann sogar sein dass es weniger werden aber wom glich werden sie schwerer
4195222 vermutlich wird es in den n chsten 10 bis 20 jahren noch keinen mittleren anstieg geben aber danach ab 2030 deutet sich ein trend an dass es besonders heftige jahre und dann wieder besonders ruhige jahre geben k nnte
4195223 derzeit gibt es in den beobachtungszahlen weltweit nirgendwo einen trend dass es mehr schwere tornados gibt die zahlen aus den usa f r die drei h chsten tornadostufen f3 bis f5 sind fast genauso hoch wie vor 80 jahren
4195224 in deutschland und ganz europa gibt es in den letzten jahren dramatisch steigende meldungszahlen es sind aber nicht mehr geworden sie werden nur eher gemeldet

4195235 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4195253 for total stroke 47 of cases in the women and 35 of cases in the men may have been prevented
4195254 this study shows that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 lower risk of coronary heart disease and 90 lower risk of diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes

4195260 patients want money to be spent on their healthcare not spent on advertising to doctors so the hospital makes more money the health service is not about making money it is about delivering care for patients
4195261 it is a sad indictment of government policy to consider spending public money on advertising nhs services when hospitals are having to make cutbacks in patient care in order to save money
4195262 the very idea that hospitals should spend taxpayers money on advertising for patients instead of on treating patients is simply ridiculous it is the governments obsession with competition and choice that is forcing hospitals to set aside common sense and waste money in this way
4195263 is to respond from pressure from your doctors and show them that you support their programs before i took this job i talked with the head of a major boston hospital who gave that as the primary reason for ads
4195264 there is no evidence that ads work in creating business he said but we need to keep our doctors happy i have certainly felt that pressure in my place and so i understand the desire to send a signal to your doctors who after all are essentially free agents who can easily change hospital affiliation that you support their practices
4195265 another purpose might be to educate the public about certain diseases and treatments i think academic medical centers like to rationalize that they are offering this general benefit to the public in their ads but really who would consider these one page blurbs an effective means for such education
4195266 i think the ads are posted mainly as a component of creating a broader brand identity it helps create a mindset that the hospital has standing and stature and permanence in the community
4195267 in protest after the station agreed to run medical stories suggested by sacred heart hospital featuring employees and services the hospital wanted to promote
4195268 and he has become something of a cause celebre in journalistic circles
4195269 we at cjr know a lot about news that crosses the line into advertising and misleads viewers and readers
4195270 last march a new variety surfaced in maryland when the capital a 47 000 circulation daily paper in annapolis sold its weekly health page to the anne arundel medical center relinquishing all control of stories pictures layout the works
4195271 experimenting with a new concept that could alarm some readers
4195272 the statement is not only a plea to news outlets to stop doing phony journalism but also an invitation for reporters to start exploring these deals in their own backyards
4195273 but aside from the ethics theres a lot wrong with them
4195274 while google doesnt have a special relationship with any seo company
4195275 we look forward to working with performics as a partner
4195276 its clear to us that we do not want to be in the search engine marketing business
4195277 maintaining objectivity in both search and advertising is paramount to googles mission and core to the trust we ask from our users
4195278 the risk of relapse was still small but certainly not insignificant
4195279 i think these numbers are somewhat reassuring but they also highlight the need for new therapeutic options for women who have completed five years of treatment
4195280 these tumors are certainly more aggressive early on but the outlook is good for women with these tumors who survive for five years
4195281 we can now tell these women that their risk for developing a recurrence is lower than for women with er positive tumors
4195282 there has been some discussion about whether aggressive treatment makes a difference and this study supports the view that it does
4195283 the jury is still out on what we need to be offering women who have finished five years of adjuvant treatment
4195284 what this study tells us is that these women still have a residual risk of recurrence that is significant
4195285 id like to see these turbines go in because the alternative is theyre going to build coal plants
4195286 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4195287 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4195288 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4195289 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4195290 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4195291 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4195292 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4195293 for the first time some american experts think roman is the underdog although of course we dont believe that hes looked really good in training and hes the lightest hes been for years 16st 8lbs
4195294 he may be 39 but that is not old for a heavyweight he is good technically and a dangerous puncher
4195295 but the challenge motivates me and i enjoy fighting in the states if all goes well everything goes upwards meaningful fights against top ranked opponents and more money
4195296 it will be very hard for the top boxing bodies not to rank roman highly
4195297 i would expect him to be in the ibf top 15
4195298 he was a tough jew when there were few but he never killed on shabbos unless he had to
4195299 a second girl slid out of my body on the third breath glistening with the caul still on her head

4195306 some kids at my new school checked the class register and found jew written against my name
4195307 when tony blair was prime minister he said he was going to proscribe them so they undertook a huge campaign to repackage themselves but it was all spin
4195308 they are doing this through football tournaments meetings at restaurants and giving teenagers jobs at their businesses they then indoctrinate them
4195309 we could still have a christmas tree with favourite ornaments we would still feast like catholics on the christmas yule log with plastic reindeer prancing through icing
4195310 we would have the biggest tree on the block and bagels and lox the next day and light chanucah candles as carefully as surgeons to the tune of a prayer we barely knew but this costume was not us
4195311 people are not spending like they did before and are buying less those who used to buy five or six challot a week now only buy one or two people are really cutting down
4195312 we cant put our prices up according to wheat price rises or people would just go somewhere non kosher to get their bread
4195313 eggs have gone up by 50 per cent flour has gone up a third and margarine prices are also rising we are also paying more in fuel where we used to fill up our van for 45 now it costs 70
4195314 we cant absorb all the increased costs all the time so we are having to increase our prices
4195315 people who used to buy 25 bottles are now buying 10 ones we have seen that a fair bit people are not buying the expensive things and it does affect profits
4195316 we are now paying about 10 to 15 per cent more for our stock than we were this time last year because the price of producing glass has increased and grapes have also become more expensive
4195317 transport is also more expensive and so is shipping the wines
4195318 we have had to put up our prices as a result although we absorb some of the increased costs we have to pass most of them on it is 100 per cent affecting our profit margins as our expenses have increased and some of our customers are buying less or buying cheaper products
4195319 in the past eight months everything has gone up and the whole balance has changed people are buying less some of my regular customers who usually put in large orders have cut them down somewhat
4195320 all our prices have gone up alongside rises for beef and lamb in the same period we are working very hard to keep any rises down to a minimum these products are going up in price very frequently but i cannot keep increasing my prices in response to every rise that we experience
4195321 the only bit of support we have had was the cut in shechitah fees by the london board of shechitah though it was only a half of a per cent off
4195322 they will manufacture only to order now for people who are prepared to pay the high prices
4195323 the manufacturers say if you want the goods you pay the price i asked them for a fixed price until 2009 but they refused
4195324 the price of flour has also risen steeply we sell one brand that is particularly good challah flour many families bake their own challot and the cost has risen between 50 and 60 per cent and thats only one item
4195325 chickens have increased in price at the farm gate but we have managed to limit the increase that has been passed on to the retailer and the consumer
4195326 facebook wouldnt do anything about it so we did what has to be done
4195327 ultimately it was a result of our enemies stupidity and our timing persistence and determination rather than anything else
4195328 the demonisation of zionists zionism and israel that is increasingly prevalent in parts of the third sector non governmental organisation community can slip very easily into demonisation of jews
4195329 an ongoing strategy by an organised pro israel lobby and the jewish press
4195330 people know they can complain about a charity and the commission is duty bound to investigate but ill meaning journalists can portray this as if the commission is investigating the charity itself
4195331 it is reasonable to ask whether these anti israel campaigns advance war on wants charitable aims of relieving poverty
4195332 after almost 15 years at highgate where both he and his wife tzipora were much loved and admired for their tireless work on behalf of the community the sufrins will find the same degree of warmth welcome and community spirit at enfield
4195333 we never take notice of religion it is citizens that count it is nothing to do with israel it is our normal business with america
4195334 i see it as normal they are all bahrainis and they like to come here to live i came here to see them this is the kingdom of tolerance
4195335 it was even more of a gesture because his son graduated from sandhurst earlier in the day
4195336 most of us had left bahrain after the six day war even though we had no problems i told the king we still remember the good days
4195337 we shared the same bench and he remembered when i mentioned it
4195338 i was pounding on the block saying the f word
4195339 maybe we can set a new world record at the maccabiah games
4195340 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time so yes i am a bit upset about it
4195341 it could be they threw out a price so high i wouldnt leave because they really want me
4195342 although this is disappointing for everyone concerned it should be remembered that there is no automatic rite of passage between the selection committee and the board of management
4195343 the bar is set very high and this provides an important system of checks and balances to ensure that any candidate meets the needs of the community while this is a setback it is clearly better that we are confident about the selection of a new rabbi rather than rushing to a conclusion that may present challenges in the future
4195344 the suggestion was that the brother and sister dragged howard into it but he is an adult and made money out of this bearing in mind they were running a number of premises the sentences were about what we would have expected
4195345 i knew i had lost my family but i had no idea how many and didnt know which camps because my parents wouldnt talk about it
4195346 i knew i would find out what happened this is the bbc and they have the tentacles to reach out around the world that wasnt surprising the shock was the impact of the story itself i knew that my family had died in the holocaust but until you see the details the signature on your grandmothers death certificate the date on which her extermination was recorded and a photo of a gas van like the one she was killed on its just a line in a biography
4195347 part of the horror of it all is the cold unemotional detached organisation of the nazis the fact that everything was written down every detail since they came to power was recorded
4195348 there was this idea that it was just hitler but it wasnt how about the soldiers who were rounding up jews to take them to the camps what did they say to their wives and kids about what they did that day what kind of a human being can that be that cancer may not have spread to the whole of the society but a lot more people than will admit to it knew exactly what was going on
4195349 it was in lodz in poland we went up to a room where my maternal grandmother lived in the ghetto there was no electricity no toilets no running water no heat they slept on the floor in the freezing cold
4195350 the woman who lives there now looks like a lovely old lady very polite i asked her if she lived in the same area during the war when she would have been about 15 she said yes we lived nearby i asked her if she ever talked about what was happening to the jews with her parents at the dinner table she said matter of factly no we didnt talk about it she wasnt defensive in fact it didnt even register on her radar
4195351 i feel much more connected to my family now if i didnt make this trip no one would know these people even existed i wouldnt have been able to tell my daughter so now i can say this is your great grandmother and this is her yahrzeit i have a complete family tree
4195352 my parents couldnt speak english very well but they refused to speak german to us because they didnt want us to speak german in the street my mother hired a helper called bridey and she spoke english with us
4195353 i was three weeks short of my fifth birthday when i left i remember everything totally we lived at belvedere court on the corner of lyttleton road near the bishops avenue the bishops avenue was all hoity toity but our block was full of refugees
4195354 i remember where i used to play i remember my friend melvin and i remember the circular tray that my mum gave me my food on when i was ill i would use it as a steering wheel and pretend to be a 102 bus driver
4195355 my parents and my sister mounted a great campaign to americanise me they got me into little league baseball and the boy scouts i played guitar and went to a frat house in college my parents sacrificed a lot for that my dad manufactured and sold stuffed toys and my mother got a job as a bank clerk they both worked until they were 70
4195356 im sure my interest in politics came from my past
4195357 we talked about politics at the dinner table my parents were democrats but they had a real distrust of government for good reason i became very active in civil rights it was always assumed that there were good guys and bad guys and that the bad guys were the ones doing the discriminating that hasnt changed in my life
4195358 i always wondered why i hung in there when my show was getting so much criticism i realised that people didnt like it not because of what was on the show but because they didnt like the participants
4195359 if you look at the newspapers every day you will see that the rich and successful are doing exactly the same as the people who come on my show and the papers cant get enough of it
4195360 diana went on international television to speak of her marriage break up her affairs and her suicidal feelings with the exception of suicide which is a bit too serious for us we cover those same subjects but no one called her trash
4195361 the people on our show are called trash because theyre uneducated they dont talk the queens english and the use the f word they didnt have the breaks that wealthy people have my career may have changed but my constituency the poor and underprivileged has remained the same
4195362 do i wish my career had taken another turn no because its still my choice i could still decide to run for office and i write occasional political columns most of my time i spend in politics which is where i get my greatest fulfilment
4195363 we never made the decision to make the show crazy but when it happened the company which owns the show said we won the lottery so we dont have a choice i could quit but i cant change the show
4195364 anyway its only two days a week and it enables me to do everything else all of my career opportunities came about because of the show i couldnt have made who do you think you are without it
4195365 im on the side of the people in my shows whether in politics or showbiz these are my people i came from a poor refugee family im no different than they are not at all its just that i got lucky and made some money were all the same some of us just dress better
4195366 im proud im the link in the chain of a wonderful family im blessed
4195367 i cannot remember a competitor starting so strongly in a major world competition
4195368 i feel good and strong and the conditions suit me but there is a long way to go yet
4195369 there is a lot of opposition to it by the residents and the school
4195370 it is unlikely to improve the area it is certainly worrying and a cause for concern the school and local residents are opposing the plans
4195371 no one at the meeting felt that the suggested security measures to be put in place at the new home were adequate
4195372 local residents are concerned that the home would encourage drug users in the area which is already a high crime area and be situated on the doorstep of king david and its 1 400 plus children
4195373 westwood will still be registered as a nursing home but the client group will be changing to provide nursing for past and present drug and alcohol users there is a local community drugs and alcohol issue that needs to be addressed
4195374 there will be a zero tolerance policy towards anyone taking drugs on the premises
4195375 relatives of alleged members of an islamist group that fought a 15 week battle with the lebanese army last year staged a protest on friday demanding their release from jail
4195376 thanks to the help of aid workers like these real progress has been made in improving the lives of the afghan people
4195377 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4195378 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4195379 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4195380 many thousands of children are alive today thanks to aid work on improving health standards six million children are now in education two million of them girls compared to one million boys with girls banned from schools under the taliban
4195381 in contrast the insurgents have nothing to offer the afghan people other than more killings and intimidation
4195382 where we have a prosecutor and a police officer working together looking closely at the evidence making sure that we target the right people we get better results
4195383 for either application weve go to show sufficient evidence to satisfy a court
4195384 the closer we work together the better we are at putting the appropriate evidence together
4195385 im talking about things like cctv footage evidence of misbehaviour on trains behaviour in pubs outside grounds and of course if people commit criminal offences
4195386 two years ago in the world cup in germany we had 3 000 bans in force
4195387 one of the conditions is people surrender their passports when england play abroad not a single one of those convicted hooligans got to germany
4195388 the end result was the german police policed english fans in a much more friendly way than they might have had to do if they were dealing with hooligans
4195389 were going into the busiest time of the year and we need the liquidity
4195390 there are a number of large institutions that have the shares and are really upset at this massive dilution
4195391 lets see how our athletes do as the events progress
4195392 i gather we have more medal hopes coming up in the back half of the games well remain optimistic and obviously cheer for everyone who wears the maple leaf
4195393 as a result of delays in our ability to put new infrastructure in place such as additional wellfields
4195394 weve got to understand where the inflow is coming from and once we understand that then were going to have to develop a plan to deal with it
4195395 i cant see in the ground any better than our people at site and right now all of the information that they have says this is an investigation we now need to conduct over the next little while
4195396 one of our advantages is weve got a diversified portfolio of sources
4195397 the latest upturn reflects financial players stepping into the market to take advantage of soft prices
4195398 this volatility is not surprising the spot market is thinly traded and minor quantities either purchased or sold can have a dramatic impact on price
4195399 we learnt our lesson when we merged with a big party like the now defunct trt thai rak thai we felt like we lived in another persons home not ours it was difficult for us to have any say it will be more dignified if we are a small or medium size party and form an alliance to join the coalition

4195420 i think it is more urban im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
4195421 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
4195422 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
4195423 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
4195424 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
4195425 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
4195426 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
4195427 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
4195428 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
4195429 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
4195430 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
4195431 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
4195432 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
4195433 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
4195434 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
4195435 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
4195436 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
4195437 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
4195438 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
4195439 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
4195440 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
4195441 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
4195442 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
4195443 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
4195444 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone

4195450 my work deals with the volume of digital information we are confronted with on a daily basis
4195451 my paintings investigate the digital world often with images inspired by computer screens the digital world is an arena where the increase of the speed and volume of information has become a hallmark of contemporary life
4195452 the idea that humans on an almost daily basis have to prove their very humanity via a test administered by a computer strikes me as both amusing and indicative of the information overload of our times
4195453 whats even more absurd is that captcha codes get cracked all the time meaning that scientists have to constantly develop new tests for humans to prove their humanity
4195454 rendering this computerized test in oil paint highlights the creative act and underscores what may be the ultimate marker of humanity our creativity and imagination
4195455 the overload of digital information is very much a hallmark of our time and my paintings reflect some of the foibles markers and icons of this exciting and complex era

4195489 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr dmitry medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4195490 the united states of america stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia it is time for this crisis to end
4195491 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4195492 it was underlined that the document should finally be signed by the georgian side as was agreed in moscow the french minister assured that paris is working on this
4195493 approximately a year and a half in the planning and execution the exhibit came about through our executive director tom pezman returning from a trip and thinking this could be a perfect venue for a surfing exhibit we followed on that up by contacting john wayne airport to see how this might come about once that was finalized it was decided to target the history of surfing in orange county which would be done geographically by beach cities and their local histories and would focus on personalities surf shops contests surf spots and the surf industry
4195494 we found that these bees harbored incredible loads of disease so the same bees that are used in greenhouses are in fact very sick bees and carry many parasites that you dont see at nearly the same level as wild populations
4195495 the model told us given everything that we know about this system that yes spillover was indeed likely to happen
4195496 we had this amazing bubble of infection around the greenhouse where up to fifty percent of wild bumblebees would be infected
4195497 this is a wave of infection that would form at the greenhouse and it would spread outward away from the greenhouse into the wild bumblebee population and it would infect a very large proportion of the wild bumblebee population potentially up to 100 percent of the wild bumblebees

4195502 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4195503 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4195504 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
4195505 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4195506 its not the intention of the u s to take control of facilities
4195507 i strongly doubt that russian prime minister vladimir putin is going to be deterred by the prospect of a u s humanitarian effort
4195508 with this new process we are reducing the travel distance of a space vehicle from 12 000 feet to 10 000 feet
4195509 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
4195510 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
4195511 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings

4195514 no existe una necesidad aparente para una acci n militar de estados unidos
4195515 me parece que los rusos estaban preparados para tomar ventaja y lo hicieron con bastante agresividad y la respuesta fue m s all simplemente reafirmar en su visi n la autonom a de abkhazia y osetia del sur
4195516 castigar a georgia m s que por su participaci n en este intercambio anual de fuego con los separatistas de osetia por atreverse a tratar de integrarse con occidente

4195530 we try every night to play just a little better defense

4195533 we played with a lot of passion and very well on defense tonight
4195534 they came prepared for us and we couldnt get anything going on offense tonight

4195554 the attendees will also learn what data governance actually is and the best practices included in data governance programs which lead to trends emerged over the past two years
4195555 similar to most workers attitudes across the nation we have experienced a steady drop in worker confidence due to the economys fluctuations and lack of broad based job creation
4195556 the bright spots in new york continue to be private sector opportunities with health care and government positions leading the way in job creation for those looking to change careers or planning their career path these are still strong industries in this economy to consider
4195557 in a lot of ways taking this time off physically probably in his head made him think he could still keep on playing and i dont doubt that from what we saw from the bat standpoint at the end of last year i certainly think if he dhd for somebody even at this late juncture in the season it doesnt take much for him to get ready we all saw that in spring training after 10 at bats hed get bored i think it would be smart for tampa bay because they are in a very unique position as history goes with baseball with a chance to win that division against those two counterparts is pretty amazing
4195558 we were looking for an opportunity to expand our property management business so paradigms decision to consolidate most of their properties under one management company came at a very good time for our company
4195559 we have enjoyed a great relationship with paradigm for many years and we are very happy to be able to build on this relationship

4195564 i definitely respect your decision i will do my best to figure out what i want i know what i want im sorry she ruins things for us i hope that you know and understand that i choose you that i am doing this because i want a life with you that ive already had that is my decision i know my decision
4195565 she went over to his apartment clutching her decision and he said did you come here to tell me goodbye so she built a skyscraper of procrastination and then she leaned out the 25th window of her reply she felt like an actress just reading her lines when she finally said yes it is really goodbye this time far below was the blacktop and tiny toy cars and it all fell so fast and it fell so far and she said you are a miracle but that is not all you are also a stiff drink and i am on call you are a party and i am a school night and im looking for my door key but you are my porch light youll never know dear just how much i loved you youll probably think this was just my big excuse but i stand committed to a love that came before you and the fact that i adore you is but one of my truths
4195566 als ik zie met welke mindset de staf tfu 5 hier is binnengekomen kan ik met een gerust hart zeggen het is tijd dat wij weggaan en dat zij beginnen
4195567 we begonnen meteen met de operatie pathan ghar qua omvang was deze net zo groot als spin ghar die onder mijn voorganger nico geerts in oktober vorig jaar werd uitgevoerd
4195568 meteen een hele kluif maar ondanks enkele kleine schermutselingen verliep de operatie verder zonder grootschalige gevechten dat was boven ieders verwachting
4195569 in de operatieplannen was al meegenomen dat het provinciaal reconstructie team prt in de slipstream van de battle group meteen het gebied in zou trekken om diverse opbouwprojecten op te starten hierbij werd ook de centrale overheid in kabul betrokken minister zhia van het ministry of rural rehabilitation and development kwam bijvoorbeeld ter plekke de situatie bekijken
4195570 isaf droeg zorg voor de terugkerende veiligheid waarna de eigen overheid zich inzette voor de verschillende ontwikkelingsprojecten
4195571 we moesten daar voor het invallen van de lente orde op zaken stellen met onder meer de operaties now ghar i en ii
4195572 deze oorlog draait om het overtuigen van de bevolking om geaccepteerd en gerespecteerd te worden moet je veel contact maken met de bewoners dat betekent veelvuldig de green in je bereikt niets door met een heleboel staal enkel over de weg te rijden
4195573 ook de militairen van het prt en het logistic support detachement kwamen zeer vaak buiten de poort
4195574 naast een vergroting van de gevechtskracht zijn zij de ogen en oren in het terrein die mannen voelen naadloos aan of er iets wel of niet in de haak is
4195575 natuurlijk weet je nooit zeker of het daardoor zo rustig is gebleven of doordat je tegenstander ervoor kiest in een ander gebied te vechten bijvoorbeeld in kandahar of helmand waar nog wel regelmatig wordt geknokt maar als je dezelfde periode vorig jaar vergelijkt met die van nu is het overduidelijk rustiger geworden in uruzgan
4195576 we kunnen het ons niet veroorloven dat afghanistan weer afzakt naar het rioolputje van de wereld daarvoor zit er gewoon te veel potentie in dit land
4195577 ten eerste gaan we ervoor zorgen dat datgene wat bereikt is in stand blijft en waar we in staat zijn de controlegebieden te vergroten zullen we dat zeker doen het is vooral belangrijk veel buiten te zijn meerdere dagen 24 uur per dag als we samen met de afghaanse veiligheidstroepen ansf veel in het gebied aanwezig zijn gaat de tegenstander zich vanzelf ongemakkelijk voelen daarmee samen hangt het intensiveren en uitbouwen van de relatie met de ansf zodat leger en politie meer en meer zelfstandig kunnen optreden voor de politie geldt dat we kijken wat wij kunnen bijdragen om ze op een beter niveau te krijgen
4195578 is om de internationale partners goed te integreren in de task force uruzgan de tsjechen zijn er al een tijdje de fransen vanaf begin augustus en de slowaken volgen nog of meer landen het werken moeilijker maakt het wordt in elk geval minder makkelijk we moeten veel meer in het engels doen verder bestaan er soms andere opvattingen over de manier van optreden en natuurlijk culturele verschillen dat zullen we allemaal tot een goed samenwerkend geheel moeten krijgen
4195579 ik voer daarbij steeds het bevel daar is geen discussie over we moeten alleen wel aandacht geven aan onze internationale partners ze laten weten dat ze erbij horen dat geldt voor iedereen binnen de tfu
4195580 langzamerhand zullen de civiele collegas meer en meer overnemen militairen van het prt komen dan steeds verder op de achtergrond voor wat betreft bestuur en ontwikkeling
4195581 vanaf de eerste missieperiode in 2006 is er steentje voor steentje gebouwd aan de versterking van de civiele component tijdens tfu 4 zijn de randvoorwaarden gecre erd voor de komst van een unama kantoor in tarin kowt dit wordt onder tfu 5 geopend dat zou de vn niet doen als het niet veilig was
4195582 in die zin dat de militairen door getraindheid verdere verbetering van procedures inlichtingen tactieken en middelen steeds beter in staat zijn die dingen op te sporen ik kan alleen nooit de garantie geven dat we niet meer op een ied lopen
4195583 iedereen of het nou gaat om een logistiekeling een infanterist of een stafneus moet weten wat we hier met zijn allen doen
4195584 i did not eat those cheetos out of her lunch
4195585 ill come to your house in the middle of the night and cut your head off

4195602 an incredible film from vancouver about a young man becoming a woman but more particularly about his family wife and friends adjustment to his decision using archival family footage interviews phone messages and animation haworths documentary shes a boy i knew begins in 2000 with steven haworths decision to come out to his family about his life long female gender identity the resulting auto ethnography is not only an exploration into the film makers process of transition from biological male to female from steven to gwen but also an emotionally charged account of the individual experiences struggles and stakes that her two sisters mother father best friend and wife brought to gwens transition

4195616 we wanted to really touch this guy with some hard punches

4195621 our brief is solely based on the issue of due process and whether or not our supreme court follows the same standards as established by the u s supreme court with regard to the right to appeal punitive damages
4195622 we did not take sides in the actual case in any way and want any citizen that has been adversely affected to get the benefits and compensation that they deserve
4195623 critical to the fair and rational imposition of punitive damages
4195624 you can go and search forever and you wont find a governor that mixes public policy with judicial review if this type of argument is made it is typically made by the attorney generals office
4195625 what is amazing to me is that while our brief is based solely on the legal principles of due process and the right of appeal the trial lawyers brief led by several big out of state law firms does not address that legal issue in any way and instead spends their time attacking my secretary who has not been involved in one meeting on this issue and who does not deserve this kind of treatment
4195626 shame on these trial lawyers for attacking this hard working state employee and grandmother simply because i as governor dared to ask a legal question about due process

4195629 african american women have learned to navigate through race class and gender and go for what they want despite the challenges
4195630 i think there are still social limitations but they can be blasted if a woman really chooses to do it
4195631 its like the superwoman complex gone bad not only can we do it all we are expected to do it all and were doing double time to catch up and surpass the expectations
4195632 even though we are getting lower pay its becoming more of the standard for a woman to bring home the bacon cook it and run the industry that sells it
4195633 the air force remains committed to providing full spectrum cyber capabilities to include global command and control electronic warfare and network defense the secretary and chief of staff of the air force have considered delaying currently planned actions on air force cyber command to allow ample time for a comprehensive assessment of all afcyber requirements and to synchronize the afcyber mission with other key air force initiatives the new air force leaders continue to make a fresh assessment of all our efforts to provide our nation and the joint force the full spectrum of air space and cyberspace capabilities

4195655 otra vez no o acaso no te acuerdas el tiempo que te cost volver a ponerte en pie o no te acuerdas de esas noche sin dormir de esos desvelos y angustias de tus d as vac os de tus noches sin estrellas quieres realmente volver a vivir todo eso o ahora que ya estas de pie no ser a mejor que anduvieras por otros caminos porque sinceramente amores no te faltan tienes la capacidad de enamorar a quien quieras y te vas a hacer problema por un hombre una mujer que en realidad no sabes si te quiere no sabes si te enga a piensa no te equivoques una vez cre ste tocar el cielo con las manos y en un instante descendiste al m s profundo de los infiernos crees que vale la pena haz lo que te digo no existen los amores eternos y seguramente todo eso lo nico que te va a hacer es ilusionarte y volverte a lastimar
4195656 no s si tus palabras son del todo ciertas pero s s que no son tampoco del todo equivocadas no es lo mismo pensar que sentir no es lo mismo razonar que hacer las cosas impulsivamente porque los que piensan son aquellos que nunca se arriesgan y pobre de aquel que no est dispuesto una vez en su vida a perderlo todo por la persona que ama pobre de aquel que no est dispuesto a olvidar porque nunca ser perdonado pobre de aquel que es tan ciego y vac o que no es capaz de dejar de lado todas las trivialidades de la vida por amor pobre de quien teniendo en frente el amor de su vida no es capaz de quitarse la careta y sentir porque el amor no s lo es alegr a no solo es paz y ternura el amor es tambi n dolor y l grimas es angustia y desvelo es muchas cosas pero bueno la verdad es que no s qu pesa m s si la raz n o el coraz n lo que si s es que si uno no siente se transforma simplemente en una roca una cosa que no es capaz de demostrar cari o y confianza un cuerpo sin alma por eso creo que uno debe jugarse por lo que siente le puede salir bien o mal puede equivocarse o vivir el resto de su vida con la persona que ama lo que s es cierto es que jam s perdonar a a alguien que por rencor o desconsuelo no sea capaz de tomar a la persona que ama y gritarle a todo el mundo que por ella dar a la vida y por ltimo otra cosa que tengo bien clara es que el que la q se enamora soy yo y el amor se siente con el coraz n no con la cabeza

4195671 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today august 11 on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia
4195672 given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
4195673 nonetheless at least two political science professors have weighed in saying the similarities are more than coincidental and wouldnt be tolerated from their own students
4195674 given that mccain by his own admission cant use the internet its a bit of an ironic situation though perhaps it counts as progress of some sort
4195675 gives a perfect example of how scheunemanns expertise is being used by team mccain
4195676 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
4195677 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
4195678 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4195679 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4195680 my first instinct was day care closes at 6 p
4195681 said dennis who works at the state department of commerce
4195682 i am going to have every friday to spend with my son
4195683 as soon as he knew this was happening we sat down with the calendar and planned out what activities he was going to do for the next three months
4195684 this friday we are going to the planetarium next friday is the zoo those are things i didnt get to do with him
4195685 the governor has made it very clear that as long as we can serve the public we need to do what we can to exercise flexibility with the employees
4195686 right now i cant tell you how its going to work
4195687 its great for the people who are getting three day weekends and i am real excited for them but its happening at our expense and thats not fair
4195688 you cant make up the soccer game that i missed on monday because you were working and didnt get home until 7 oclock at night or sitting down to do homework with the boys you cant make that up
4195689 if i can keep a dollar from going overseas ill spend two dollars
4195690 sales trends are definitely up as the price of gasoline goes up
4195691 anyone who has basic mechanical skills can build one of these
4195692 what people dont always realize is that the average person only drives 20 miles per day
4195693 i hope at some point that i will be able to drive it on a more regular basis and that it will be more useful
4195694 do i expect it to someday to be my only car no
4195695 when gas goes up more people call me and more people come to the meetings
4195696 you know theres going to be a lot of people happy for us but at the same time there will be a few people who will never approve

4195698 i used to but now i dont care anymore youre right no one can get in our way
4195699 bitch i dont like that shirt on you itll look better on me
4195700 are we really done are you really becoming a hero im here for you regardless we dont need a silly team name to keep our friendship
4195701 i dont care what joseph moorer says i will always be a villain and the injustice league is right here
4195702 valen tyine massacre super hyper villain says in a low tone
4195703 i have a plan for all of us and youll finally get what you really want
4195704 i will give you the tools to further your career take this track list to a man named chris davis you no longer have a 9 5 you are an aspiring artist and you will blow up by winter or die trying now go and do not return until you have accomplished what you were created to do

4195711 then ill be happy to send your sensitive ass back to where you crawled out from fool bring it
4195712 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4195713 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look forward to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
4195714 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4195715 im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4195716 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4195717 to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today
4195718 full credit to him he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
4195719 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
4195720 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
4195721 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4195722 evil sorry im still at work ill talk to you later
4195723 hi cecile the handyman keeps trying to call you but you may not answer or know him his name is ivel and he has a really raspy voice thats hard to hear sometimes hes been trying to reach you to make any repairs to your place
4195724 what you dont even need pants that big what the hell was she thinking
4195725 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
4195726 would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate
4195727 recoginzing that two people can love each other but just not be able to make an intimate relationship work is the basis of letting go without the guilt and letting go with forgiveness
4195728 they have raised consumer expectations of how much control they should have over their media choices we havent seen that kind of innovation in the magazine space sending seven or eight renewal notices in the mail and saying time to write a check that seems like an antiquated way to do things
4195729 the model were following is a lot like cable tv
4195730 youve got real consumers spending real money and making their decisions in a magazine centric environment
4195731 this offers a good positive economic return for the publishers but theres always a question of where that should be
4195732 in a jump ball situation then yes time inc titles would get some preference
4195733 but maghound will be trying to maximize maghounds revenues not time inc s revenues
4195734 my feeling is people who sign up will forget about it and the magazines will keep coming whether they want them or not
4195735 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4195736 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests in india against the touring england squad which will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings the ipl finalists to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4195737 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4195738 conveyed the new dates to the icc and they are fine with it
4195739 that means that youll sync less and get the data you care about faster than before this will be a plus for everyone but will especially benefit edge users and those with spotty connections
4195740 eyes hide two speakers and the mouth lights up to let you know that the ipig is on or that its receiving commands from its wireless remote control which also lets you control the ipod
4195741 because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the dessert
4195742 the keeper of a consistent and agreed upon vision of the applications being developed
4195743 everything we have been conditioned to believe indicates that project time is shrinking and while i believe this is true in highly optimized and mature organizations i do think in house development is fraught with problems delays and indecision
4195744 youve given us lots of feedback on the way our experimental sharing features work and we heard you loud and clear you want more control over your sharing
4195745 e mail was down voice was spotty but sms still worked we also had two female staff at a school near the incident and were able to tell them to stay put till things quieted down all my staff made it home safe today
4195746 drivers receive updates on traffic congestion road blocks police operations vip movements local minor security incidents and anything else that might be useful as they travel
4195747 senior staff receive sms messages regarding larger security incidents that may require them to modify program activities for the short term incidents that influence activities in other areas are sent to the sub office group finally we have an all staff category for those situations where we need to notify or account for everyone as quickly as possible
4195748 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive

4195756 the enhancement standard is a difficult one to meet so this is still a great success its a very important case for us
4195757 we were comfortable in asking for the fees to be doubled because of the risk we took in working on this case we knew this was on our dime and we had to be careful ourselves in our staffing decisions we knew our recovery was totally dependent on our winning

4195772 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4195773 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4195774 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4195775 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4195776 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4195777 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people

4195804 the combination of higher prices and increased gasoline consumption has raised the portion of income consumers allocate to gasoline to 3 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 from 2 9 per cent in 2002
4195805 the increase in spending on gasoline since 2002 was offset by the drop in the share of income devoted to purchasing autos from 6 2 per cent to 5 3 per cent the drop for autos entirely reflects lower prices as canadians increased vehicle purchases over the last six years

4195808 the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian action in the days ahead
4195809 if russia does not stop back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russia relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4195810 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4195811 the situation here is indeed tense and we have reports about the movement of the russian troops almost every hour and theres no discernable pattern other than they are not withdrawing just yet
4195812 it started out ok but that soon gave way to small sporadic shootings and fires in the provincial town of gori the georgian population and leaders are very much concerned about the situation
4195813 russia has not taken the right steps and is not following its commitment
4195814 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states and europe and other nations russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4195815 james the only difference between the russian action on its border and the us action on its southern border is that the russian military is actually competent and effective
4195816 mhr i am actually on russia side on this one they are defending an tiny province that are considering to join russia georgia invaded this tiny province so what do you think
4195817 i came in on a tank and only a tank will remove me
4195818 what nation is powerful enough on the world stage to intervene in the aggression shown by russia
4195819 this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality and i think its something all democratic countries should speak out strongly against i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4195820 god it would be nice to beat the u s
4195821 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4195822 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out

4195901 ministers have proven time and time again that they are not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seem intent on pressing ahead with this snoopers charter

4195903 once again the government seems prepared to be more invasive than its eu counterparts in seeking to hold phone records for two years rather than six months
4195904 as ever with the database state this is a mass surveillance measure for the retrospective convenience of officialdom in general
4195905 bugging and tracking genuine suspects in real ongoing investigations is unaffected this is keeping everything it might be convenient to know about you and me for a rainy day
4195906 this data is a vital tool to investigations and intelligence gathering in support of national security and crime
4195907 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data without the directive investigative opportunities will increasingly be lost
4195908 implementing the ec directive will enable uk law enforcement to benefit fully from historical communications data in increasingly complex investigations and will enhance our national security
4195909 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4195910 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4195911 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4195912 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

4195915 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4195916 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4195917 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4195918 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4195919 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4195920 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4195921 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4195922 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4195923 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4195924 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran
4195925 we need to come out with more intensity and we need more leadership guys need to get after it better and bring more energy so it wasnt good enough we need to be a lot better
4195926 we made a lot of big plays so thats always a positive guys did a real good job at the receiver position we got a lot of yards after the catch our running backs ran hard it was definitely the best day our receivers have had so that was a positive all in all it was a good day for the offense
4195927 i thought casey dick did a good job yesterday and did a lot of good things
4195928 he moved the team well he still has a few things he can improve on but hes played well and showed a lot of progress im real happy i think hes doing good
4195929 the hardest thing for him was that hed never taken a ball from under center
4195930 and never even had a cadence so its those simple things that you think are real easy early on are harder for him to do and adjust but hes real instinctive and did some nice things yesterday
4195931 i think at the receiver position sometimes its survival of the fittest
4195932 if you go down someone else steps up and has a day then youve lost your job so i always tell them every day that its survival of the fittest and if youre not tough enough to be out there then youre not going to play
4195933 they all have to be game ready theyre all preparing to play that crew and all those freshmen shouldnt think about anything but playing theyre all trying to show skills that they can do we always say that the film is your resume so they have to show on film what routes and stuff theyre good at they showed that yesterday by putting things on their resume that were good

4195940 we are planning a special event to properly honor annie as both a simple humble woman of irish heritage from the lower east side and as an irish american historic icon
4195941 we understand that annie holds a special place in the hearts and minds of irish american immigrants and their families here in america and ireland there has been such interest in annie and the discovery of the real story of her life as a new yorker that we expect this event to be fairly high profile and well attended by the public especially the new york irish community
4195942 all are welcome to join the family and project supporters we hope to honor annie as well as celebrate her place in history with this special dedication ceremony
4195943 the steering committee has also extended invitations to genealogist megan smolenyak smolenyak who unveiled the annie moore mystery in september 2006 and to cardinal edward egan or a representative of the archdiocese of new york to preside over the ceremony
4195944 we plan to incorporate both cultural and liturgical aspects into the dedication which we think are both fitting and appropriate to the occasion
4195945 the support from around the country and ireland has really been amazing we are so touched by the generosity of all of our donors and a so grateful
4195946 now isnt this better than sitting at a table a girl hasnt got but two sides to her at the table

4195948 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4195949 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4195950 i believe this is also good news for the industry
4195951 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal
4195952 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
4195953 it is our hope that skate cornwall will have the best of equipment for the competitive training and the retention of its participants as well as provide an opportunity to encourage new members to join the organization
4195954 the on ice jumping harness will provide the figure skaters with added safety when undertaking high risk maneuvers and assist them at enhancing their skills
4195955 the skaters coaches and board of directors are very pleased to have received funding to purchase the jump harness as this will benefit the skaters who are learning multi revolution jumps safely
4195956 skaters wont need to travel to other rinks to use their harness as we will now have our own this is a very exciting time for our club
4195957 we are delighted with the interest and enthusiasm shown by the organizers of the cne and the public from across canada the canadian national exhibition is the largest annual event in canada and provides a wonderful opportunity to continue to let the quilt touch the hearts of so many

4195961 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4195962 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4195963 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4195964 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4195965 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4195966 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4195967 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4195968 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4195969 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4195970 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4195971 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4195972 they remain subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations
4195973 because they are active members and contributing to the support network for karadzic
4195974 they are part of a network that has been the subject of ongoing for many years
4195975 with their bank accounts ordered frozen five years ago how is it that theyve come to live with no visible means of support all this time
4195976 they have multiple properties they take vacations in belgrade how no money no jobs they dont pay income tax they have cash in their house they cant explain how it gets there
4195977 karadzic as has been proven to be the case and mladic remain within the reach of serbian authorities and always have been
4195978 as a christian i do not have to face a specific direction to pray because god is omnipresent
4195979 todays releases suggest that this probability has risen probably to over 50 percent now
4195980 i think its a bit exaggerated to use that word
4195981 the signs are not really very good for the future
4195982 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
4195983 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4195984 the russian role in georgia has massive implications for the russian role in ukraine and the baltic republics not surprisingly they are taking an increasingly strong line on this because they see this as a defining moment for their relationship with russia
4195985 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than in the middle or at the end of it
4195986 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4195987 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4195988 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4195989 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4195990 before we never had problems like this just a few bad people causing trouble
4195991 im feeling really frightened now its not safe at all
4195992 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
4195993 people who directly and indirectly supported the coup were appointed as members of organizations responsible for taking action against me
4195994 i would say beating the number one player in the world has got to be up there
4195995 the feeling the emotion involved is huge its something i have to not think about right now because theres still work to be done in this tournament
4195996 wow i dont think you could see that in another country they all wished me luck

4196032 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4196033 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4196034 obama refrained from raising clintons stinking past in the white house
4196035 mr barak obama youll make a spectacular president and i look forward to you being sworn into office in january god bless you and god bless america
4196036 michigan and florida did not count get over it your party made the rules follow the rules unless you are hillary right
4196037 some clinton backers had said they would leave the convention after clinton speaks on tuesday night as part of an ongoing protest against obamas nomination
4196038 hillary clintons name will symbolically be placed into nomination at the democratic national convention but then she will quickly turn her delegates over to barack obama and cast her superdelegate vote for him
4196039 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4196040 im sorry to all the american people im sorry i lied about my indonesian citizenship im sorry i have set race relations back 50 years
4196041 i hate to burst your bubble but obama won the popular vote
4196042 counting obama as having zero votes in michigan might put hillary on top
4196043 but it ignores the 40 who voted to send undeclared delegates to the convention
4196044 those were obama votes since his name wasnt on the ballot

4196080 this strength of ours needs to be consolidated to the maximum with all sincerity and earnestness
4196081 people in manipur are observing patriots day today like never before maybe because of the injustice done to monika people are considering denial of the weightlifter from beijing olympics a form of repression
4196082 new delhi is trying to suppress the people of manipur the manner in which she was thrown out of the indian contingent to the olympics is a glaring example of the suppression of manipuri people by the indian government
4196083 we should observe the day every year to instil a sense of patriotism in young minds
4196084 it is too late for monika to come to beijing now and take part in the olympic games because we have closed the entry process
4196085 what can mr kalmadi do it is not national games it is olympic games and only ioc can take a decision
4196086 monika just cannot take part in the beijing olympics as of now the organisers have not accepted her entry and to be honest i dont see her competing here
4196087 see you cannot stop anyone from coming here but the thing is she cannot take part her name has been withdrawn and how can she compete she will not be allowed to enter the olympic village
4196088 i have requested him mr krishnamurthy to come to delhi at the earliest to hold this inquiry and to favour me with his report and recommendations at the earliest
4196089 as sports minister while i am determined to set up an independent technically proficient dope testing mechanism which has credibility in the world and towards which end i have taken certain steps already i am also equally anxious that no sportsperson should suffer due to any laxity or delay on the part of this testing mechanism while ensuring prompt and firm action in monika devis case i am determined to ensure that such incidents do not happen in future i want to assure all sportspersons that they will get full consideration and fair treatment from me at all times
4196090 i have no plans to go for retirement but after the huge media hype i fear that the ioa sai and iwf may not give me the no objection certificate which will deprive me from taking part in future competitions
4196091 a top ranking official in sai is threatening and metally harassing me in order to remove me out of the indian team and favouring another player
4196092 i have been training hard for this olympics since the last three years i also gave several tests and none of them were positive except for the sample collected in pune
4196093 the sai must have manipulated my sample otherwise how could other samples taken just about a fortnight later be negative
4196094 if i had tested positive why was i allowed to continue in the olympic camp for more than two months why did they announce the result just before i was due to leave for beijing
4196095 the entire episode appears to be a big manipulative game played by sai the national dope testing laboratory and the ioa against a sportsperson whose dream for olympics has been shattered
4196096 the sai the highest authority of indian sports has done a great damage to the career of the monika its a great injustice with a pre planned motive done to an international sportsperson
4196097 monika will not go to beijing now as there is no way for her to compete in the games
4196098 it was all a procedural lapse and those responsible for it would be taken to task
4196099 despite putting forth our demands to the sports ministry several times they refused to cooperate a large number of students including those who held a meeting with ministry officials were arrested but we will not give up
4196100 we are demanding a white paper and sai should conduct an inquiry into the matter one day they say the test is positive another day they say it is negative how can things work in this manner
4196101 we detained around 60 students but have released them after giving them a warning
4196102 i felt sad because of her and manipur india could have earned a name in the olympics going on in china after the news of the doping controversy it was said two days later that it was wrong
4196103 a great injustice has been done to monika devi manipur has an extremely healthy sporting tradition how many people would be aware that the current indian soccer team in the olympics has as many as four players from the state
4196104 how many people in delhi a country in miniature would be aware of bir tikendrajit and general thangal the two illustrious freedom fighters from the state
4196105 we burst teargas shells and resorted to mild baton charge to disperse the protesters the situation is normal and there were no reports of any injuries
4196106 we want a thorough investigation and the intervention of the manipur government to ensure that monika devi is included in the indian olympic squad
4196107 this entire episode is nothing but a conspiracy against my daughter to promote someone else we want the test to be confirmed by the world anti doping agency wada and request the authorities to repeat the test at the doping test facility in beijing
4196108 this is another attempt at defaming sportspersons from the northeast and reflects the attitude of the mainstream towards the northeast
4196109 there is no need to get another weightlifter it is already embarrassing enough before the games and since there is no chance of a medal what is the point in raking up the issue again
4196110 we are actually relieved it happened before she reached here because it would have shamed the country if she had failed a test at the olympics
4196111 the eskimo has fifty two names for snow because it is important to them there ought to be as many for love
4196112 it is clear that in the north east insurgency and underdevelopment have been closely linked in such a situation strong arm tactics will only help to further alienate the people
4196113 the military and air force of the union so operating
4196114 military forces and the air forces operating as land forces
4196115 that probably means that the government very mercifully has not permitted the air forces to shoot or strafe the area or to bomb
4196116 of the opinion that whole or parts of the area are in a dangerous or disturbed condition such that the use of the armed forces in aid of civil powers is necessary
4196117 a state government is satisfied that i there was or ii there is in any area within a state extensive disturbance of the public peace and tranquility by reason of differences or disputes between members of different religions racial language or regional groups or castes or communities it may declare such area to be a disturbed area
4196118 the power to intervene in a disturbed state at any time
4196119 of the opinion that it is necessary to do so for the maintenance of public order
4196120 no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law
4196121 acting in contravention of any law or order for the time being in force in the disturbed area prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons or the carrying of weapons or of things capable of being used as weapons or fire arms ammunition or explosive substances
4196122 if to save hundred lives one life is put in peril or if a law ensures and protects the greater social interest then such law will be a wholesome and beneficial law although it may infringe the liberty of some individuals
4196123 the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of india
4196124 1 no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice 2 every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate
4196125 these persons military personnel have the authority to act only within the limits that have been prescribed generally in the crpc or in the constitution
4196126 the failure to identify those responsible for human rights violations and bring them to justice has meant that members of the security forces continue to believe that they are above the law and can violate human rights with impunity
4196127 immediately takes away abrogates pinches frustrates the right to constitutional remedy which has been given in article 32 1 of the constitution
4196128 the right to move the supreme court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part is guaranteed
4196129 if i was asked to name any particular article of the constitution as the most important an article without which this constitution would be a nullity i would not refer to any other article except this one article 32 it is the very soul of the constitution and the very heart of it
4196130 now who is to decide whether a right is one which has been guaranteed under this article article 32 the supreme court will decide it
4196131 to bridge the gap between the army and civil laws as far as possible in the matter of punishments of offenses
4196132 hand over thoroughly entirely and completely to the armed forces
4196133 facilitated and aggravated by several factors such as exercise of the powers specific to states of emergency without a formal declaration non observance of the principle of proportionality between the gravity of the measures taken and the situation concerned too vague a definition of offenses against state security and the existence of special or emergency jurisdictions
4196134 in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed
4196135 involve discrimination solely on the ground of race colour sex language religion or social origin
4196136 enables the army to supplement the civil authorities in powers of arrest powers of search
4196137 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating him or other person
4196138 some torture victims were left for dead others were reportedly subjected to other forms of torture including inserting chili powder into sensitive parts of the body being given electric shocks by means of a hand operated dynamo or being buried up to the neck in apparent mock executions
4196139 i was called out and repeatedly interrogated throughout the day i was beaten by the officers an jawans they also indiscriminately attack ed the villagers chili powder dissolved in water was rubbed into the nostrils eyes and soft parts of the body and officers and jawans took sadistic pleasure from the cries of pain by the victims
4196140 it is very difficult to understand the logic such useless raids mass torture and interrogations unless the purpose is taken to be the creation of pure terror for some sinister and ulterior motives
4196141 rounded up villagers for forced labour for such tasks as porter service building new army camps washing clothes and carrying firewood
4196142 everyone has the right to liberty and security of person no one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention no one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such ground and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law
4196143 anyone who is arrested shall be informed at the time of arrest of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him
4196144 anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or other official authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time of release
4196145 infiltration of aliens into the territories mingling with the local public and encouraging them towards this secession
4196146 law enforcement officials shall at all times fulfil the duty imposed upon them by law by serving the community and by protecting all persons against illegal act consistent with the high degree of responsibility required by their profession
4196147 in the performance of their duty law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons
4196148 law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty
4196149 squarely within the requirements of article 3 of the code
4196150 a this provision emphasizes that the use of force by law enforcement officials should be exceptional while it implies that law enforcement officials may be authorized to use force as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the prevention of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders no force going beyond that may be used
4196151 in general firearms should not be used except when a suspected offender offers armed resistance or otherwise jeopardizes the lives of others and less extreme measures are not sufficient to restrain or apprehend the suspected offender
4196152 no law enforcement official may inflict instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as state of war or a threat of war a threat to national security internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
4196153 anyone who is arrested shall be informed at the time of his arrest of the reason for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of the charges against him
4196154 a person who does not adequately understand or speak the language used by the authorities responsible for his arrest detention or imprisonment is entitled to receive information promptly in a language which he understands
4196155 governments shall prohibit orders from superior officers or public authorities authorizing or inciting other person to carry out any such extra legal arbitrary or summary executions all persons shall have the right and the duty to defy such orders training of law enforcement officials shall emphasize the above provisions
4196156 an impartial humanitarian body such as the international committee of the red cross may offer its services to the parties to the conflict
4196157 in situations of internal disturbance the rules of international humanitarian law can only be invoked by analogy
4196158 the judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law without any restrictions improper influences inducements pressure threats or interferences direct or indirect from any quarter or for any reason
4196159 the strength of legal institutions is a form of insurance for the rule of law and for the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and for preventing the denial and miscarriage of justice
4196160 governments which have been maintaining states of emergency in force for many years should lift them limit their effects or review the custodial measures that affect many persons and in particular should apply the principle of proportionality rigorously
4196161 an effective international strategy to counter terrorism should use human rights as its unifying framework the suggestion that human rights violations are permissible in certain circumstances is wrong the essence of human rights is that human life and dignity must not be compromised and that certain acts whether carried out by state or non state actors are never justified no matter what the ends international human rights and humanitarian law define the boundaries of permissible political and military conduct a reckless approach towards human life and liberty undermines counter terrorism measures
4196162 i am afraid that without the afspa the army will not be able to function in insurgency situations without the act we will be a reactive
4196163 there is no doubt that states have legitimate reasons right and duty to take all due measures to eliminate terrorism to protect their nationals human rights democracy and the rule of law and to bring the perpetrators of such acts to justice
4196164 in consonance with the obligations of the government towards protection of human rights
4196165 there assam and manipur they certain misguided sections of the nagas in the words of mr pant are indulging in arson murder loot dacoity etc so it has become necessary to adopt effective measures for the protection of the people in those areas in order to enable the armed forces to handle the situation effectively wherever such problem arises hereafter it has been considered necessary to introduce this bill
4196166 in my humble opinion this measure is unnecessary and also unwarranted
4196167 whereas it is essential if man is not to be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression that human rights should be protected by the rule of law
4196168 i amend the provisions of the act to bring them in consonance with the obligations of the government towards protection of human rights or ii replace the act by a more humane legislation
4196169 no prosecution suit or other legal proceedings shall be instituted except with the previous sanction of the central government against any person in respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of powers conferred by this act
4196170 each state party to the present covenant undertakes to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity to ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial administrative or legislative authorities or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the state and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy to ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies
4196171 impunity for human rights offenders seriously undermines the rule of law and also widens the gap between those close to the power structures and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses
4196172 article 6 of the armed forces special powers act which prevented all legal proceedings against members of the armed forces was extremely worrying if the governments fear was that citizens would bring vexatious or frivolous actions that was a matter better left to the courts to resolve it was inadmissible for citizens to be deprived of a remedy as was at present the case
4196173 with concern that criminal prosecutions or civil proceedings against members of the security and armed forces acting under special powers may not be commenced without the sanction of the central government this contributes to a climate of impunity and deprives people of remedies to which they may be entitled in accordance with article 2 paragraph 3 of the covenant
4196174 this strength of ours needs to be consolidated to the maximum with all sincerity and earnestness

4196201 this entire episode is nothing but a conspiracy against my daughter to promote someone else we want the test to be confirmed by the world anti doping agency wada and request the authorities to repeat the test at the doping test facility in beijing
4196202 this is another attempt at defaming sportspersons from the northeast and reflects the attitude of the mainstream towards the northeast
4196203 there is no need to get another weightlifter it is already embarrassing enough before the games and since there is no chance of a medal what is the point in raking up the issue again
4196204 we are actually relieved it happened before she reached here because it would have shamed the country if she had failed a test at the olympics
4196205 the eskimo has fifty two names for snow because it is important to them there ought to be as many for love
4196206 it is clear that in the north east insurgency and underdevelopment have been closely linked in such a situation strong arm tactics will only help to further alienate the people
4196207 the military and air force of the union so operating
4196208 military forces and the air forces operating as land forces
4196209 that probably means that the government very mercifully has not permitted the air forces to shoot or strafe the area or to bomb
4196210 of the opinion that whole or parts of the area are in a dangerous or disturbed condition such that the use of the armed forces in aid of civil powers is necessary
4196211 a state government is satisfied that i there was or ii there is in any area within a state extensive disturbance of the public peace and tranquility by reason of differences or disputes between members of different religions racial language or regional groups or castes or communities it may declare such area to be a disturbed area
4196212 the power to intervene in a disturbed state at any time
4196213 of the opinion that it is necessary to do so for the maintenance of public order
4196214 no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law
4196215 acting in contravention of any law or order for the time being in force in the disturbed area prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons or the carrying of weapons or of things capable of being used as weapons or fire arms ammunition or explosive substances
4196216 if to save hundred lives one life is put in peril or if a law ensures and protects the greater social interest then such law will be a wholesome and beneficial law although it may infringe the liberty of some individuals
4196217 the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of india
4196218 1 no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice 2 every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate
4196219 these persons military personnel have the authority to act only within the limits that have been prescribed generally in the crpc or in the constitution
4196220 the failure to identify those responsible for human rights violations and bring them to justice has meant that members of the security forces continue to believe that they are above the law and can violate human rights with impunity
4196221 immediately takes away abrogates pinches frustrates the right to constitutional remedy which has been given in article 32 1 of the constitution
4196222 the right to move the supreme court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part is guaranteed
4196223 if i was asked to name any particular article of the constitution as the most important an article without which this constitution would be a nullity i would not refer to any other article except this one article 32 it is the very soul of the constitution and the very heart of it
4196224 now who is to decide whether a right is one which has been guaranteed under this article article 32 the supreme court will decide it
4196225 to bridge the gap between the army and civil laws as far as possible in the matter of punishments of offenses
4196226 hand over thoroughly entirely and completely to the armed forces
4196227 facilitated and aggravated by several factors such as exercise of the powers specific to states of emergency without a formal declaration non observance of the principle of proportionality between the gravity of the measures taken and the situation concerned too vague a definition of offenses against state security and the existence of special or emergency jurisdictions
4196228 in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed
4196229 involve discrimination solely on the ground of race colour sex language religion or social origin
4196230 enables the army to supplement the civil authorities in powers of arrest powers of search
4196231 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating him or other person
4196232 some torture victims were left for dead others were reportedly subjected to other forms of torture including inserting chili powder into sensitive parts of the body being given electric shocks by means of a hand operated dynamo or being buried up to the neck in apparent mock executions
4196233 i was called out and repeatedly interrogated throughout the day i was beaten by the officers an jawans they also indiscriminately attack ed the villagers chili powder dissolved in water was rubbed into the nostrils eyes and soft parts of the body and officers and jawans took sadistic pleasure from the cries of pain by the victims
4196234 it is very difficult to understand the logic such useless raids mass torture and interrogations unless the purpose is taken to be the creation of pure terror for some sinister and ulterior motives
4196235 rounded up villagers for forced labour for such tasks as porter service building new army camps washing clothes and carrying firewood
4196236 everyone has the right to liberty and security of person no one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention no one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such ground and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law
4196237 anyone who is arrested shall be informed at the time of arrest of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him
4196238 anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or other official authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time of release
4196239 infiltration of aliens into the territories mingling with the local public and encouraging them towards this secession
4196240 law enforcement officials shall at all times fulfil the duty imposed upon them by law by serving the community and by protecting all persons against illegal act consistent with the high degree of responsibility required by their profession
4196241 in the performance of their duty law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons
4196242 law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty
4196243 squarely within the requirements of article 3 of the code
4196244 a this provision emphasizes that the use of force by law enforcement officials should be exceptional while it implies that law enforcement officials may be authorized to use force as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the prevention of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders no force going beyond that may be used
4196245 in general firearms should not be used except when a suspected offender offers armed resistance or otherwise jeopardizes the lives of others and less extreme measures are not sufficient to restrain or apprehend the suspected offender
4196246 no law enforcement official may inflict instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as state of war or a threat of war a threat to national security internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
4196247 anyone who is arrested shall be informed at the time of his arrest of the reason for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of the charges against him
4196248 a person who does not adequately understand or speak the language used by the authorities responsible for his arrest detention or imprisonment is entitled to receive information promptly in a language which he understands
4196249 governments shall prohibit orders from superior officers or public authorities authorizing or inciting other person to carry out any such extra legal arbitrary or summary executions all persons shall have the right and the duty to defy such orders training of law enforcement officials shall emphasize the above provisions
4196250 an impartial humanitarian body such as the international committee of the red cross may offer its services to the parties to the conflict
4196251 in situations of internal disturbance the rules of international humanitarian law can only be invoked by analogy
4196252 the judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law without any restrictions improper influences inducements pressure threats or interferences direct or indirect from any quarter or for any reason
4196253 the strength of legal institutions is a form of insurance for the rule of law and for the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and for preventing the denial and miscarriage of justice
4196254 governments which have been maintaining states of emergency in force for many years should lift them limit their effects or review the custodial measures that affect many persons and in particular should apply the principle of proportionality rigorously
4196255 an effective international strategy to counter terrorism should use human rights as its unifying framework the suggestion that human rights violations are permissible in certain circumstances is wrong the essence of human rights is that human life and dignity must not be compromised and that certain acts whether carried out by state or non state actors are never justified no matter what the ends international human rights and humanitarian law define the boundaries of permissible political and military conduct a reckless approach towards human life and liberty undermines counter terrorism measures
4196256 i am afraid that without the afspa the army will not be able to function in insurgency situations without the act we will be a reactive
4196257 there is no doubt that states have legitimate reasons right and duty to take all due measures to eliminate terrorism to protect their nationals human rights democracy and the rule of law and to bring the perpetrators of such acts to justice
4196258 in consonance with the obligations of the government towards protection of human rights
4196259 there assam and manipur they certain misguided sections of the nagas in the words of mr pant are indulging in arson murder loot dacoity etc so it has become necessary to adopt effective measures for the protection of the people in those areas in order to enable the armed forces to handle the situation effectively wherever such problem arises hereafter it has been considered necessary to introduce this bill
4196260 in my humble opinion this measure is unnecessary and also unwarranted
4196261 whereas it is essential if man is not to be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression that human rights should be protected by the rule of law
4196262 i amend the provisions of the act to bring them in consonance with the obligations of the government towards protection of human rights or ii replace the act by a more humane legislation
4196263 no prosecution suit or other legal proceedings shall be instituted except with the previous sanction of the central government against any person in respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of powers conferred by this act
4196264 each state party to the present covenant undertakes to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity to ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial administrative or legislative authorities or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the state and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy to ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies
4196265 impunity for human rights offenders seriously undermines the rule of law and also widens the gap between those close to the power structures and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses
4196266 article 6 of the armed forces special powers act which prevented all legal proceedings against members of the armed forces was extremely worrying if the governments fear was that citizens would bring vexatious or frivolous actions that was a matter better left to the courts to resolve it was inadmissible for citizens to be deprived of a remedy as was at present the case
4196267 with concern that criminal prosecutions or civil proceedings against members of the security and armed forces acting under special powers may not be commenced without the sanction of the central government this contributes to a climate of impunity and deprives people of remedies to which they may be entitled in accordance with article 2 paragraph 3 of the covenant

4196269 surely we have honoured the children of adam and carried them on land and sea
4196270 and if allah wills he would certainly make you a single nation but he causes to err whom he wills and guides whom he wills and most certainly you will be questioned as to what you did

4196273 he who does not judge him herself daily is not from us if one does a good deed allah will increase it while if he does an evil deed allah forgives him
4196274 surely the hearing and the sight and the heart all of these s hall be questioned about that
4196275 he utters not a word but there is by him a watcher at hand
4196276 he cannot be questioned concerning what he does and they shall be questioned
4196277 so extend to them your forgiveness and pardon in the same way as you would like allah to extend his forgiveness and pardon to you because you are over them and your responsible commander imam is over you while allah is over him w ho has appointed you
4196278 and as for the believing men and the believing women they are guardians of each other they enjoin good and forbid evil
4196279 the example of him who sets the limits of allah and then contradicts them is like a people who were travelling together on a ship
4196280 nay i swear by the day of resurrection nay i swear by the self accusing self
4196281 no foot of a servant of allah on the resurrection day will move before being asked about four things his years age and how he spent them his youth and how he worn it out his wealth and how he earned it and on what he spend it and about his love towards us the ahlul bait the prophets household

4196290 the marketplace is looking forward to the fact that energy and commodity prices have come down substantially
4196291 that should bring the year over year number down a bit

4196293 was lower than the previous weeks revision it still indicates that employment opportunities are getting fewer and fewer
4196294 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4196295 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4196296 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4196297 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4196298 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4196299 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4196300 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4196301 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe
4196302 do you not know have you not heard the lord is the everlasting god the creator of the ends of the earth he will not grow tired or weary and his understanding no one can fathom

4196325 in a wide ranging interview aboard his campaign plane this morning john mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits serious consideration despite his support for abortion rights
4196326 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4196327 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4196328 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice

4196360 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4196361 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4196362 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4196363 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4196364 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4196365 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4196366 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4196367 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4196368 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4196369 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4196370 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4196371 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4196376 a lot of guys go out randomly hitting areas looking for targets and signs that there will be something
4196377 i havent heard anything on the street but i know that property crimes are up we certainly beefed up security since
4196378 the percentage of solvability is not really high it depends on people in the neighborhood we have to use their eyes to see whats going on

4196466 it was a bad trip you cant sugar coat it
4196467 the whole issue is whether the infants from whom the hearts were taken were dead it seems very clear to me that they were not
4196468 i think its illegal and if its illegal what were talking about is the physicians causing the death of the three patients and that would be homicide its immoral i think it should be stopped
4196469 the whole area of organ donation relies on the public trusting physicians in that they believe they wont murder them or commit homicide they wont hasten their deaths

4196500 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4196501 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4196502 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves

4196507 attribution and modification transparency requirements directly serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform downstream users of the project which is a significant economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce
4196508 just because someone distributes something for free doesnt mean that theyre waiving their copyright remedies
4196509 in the normal case the license says you can use it as long as you pay me money
4196510 this is the first time this situation has come up with respect to an open source license

4196518 do you have people skills we can teach the rest
4196519 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4196520 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4196521 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4196522 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4196523 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4196524 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china

4196556 in the past two years the cis has been an all purpose negotiating forum where vladimir putin and mikheil saakashvili the armenian and azerbaijani presidents could meet and talk
4196557 but at the moment it is no more than a special interest club which in spite of attempted reforms by the presidents of kazakhstan and russia remains just that therefore nothing real and practical has been happening within the cis
4196558 the fact of georgias withdrawal from the cis is not all that important of late tbilisi has hardly signed anything within the commonwealth and has used it solely as a negotiating forum but this provocative step attracts the attention of the cis elites to russias use of force against georgia the cis elites are beginning to project this situation onto themselves and feel mistrust toward moscow this is especially true of azerbaijan which has the nagorny karabakh problem on its hands

4196598 yes of course definitely i really want to make it here
4196599 at the beginning i wasnt really playing maybe only 10 or 20 minutes at the end of the games but when the coach was replaced i found new confidence and i worked myself into the team
4196600 the beginning was difficult because i have never had that situation before that was the hard part i needed to learn from it and i did it just shows that nobody will just give you something you have to work hard for it
4196601 i worked my way into the team and from there my experience was very good i got new friends too so in general it was a very good time for me
4196602 playing professionally is a new situation one where you play in front of 25 000 people one with pressure from press and fans every single week i am not saying it is better than reserve football here because you learn so much but it is different
4196603 it looks more like the first team and that can prepare you and make you a better player
4196604 it fills me happiness that i am at arsenal a great club and one of the best for young people
4196605 i will keep going with what i do best and going into my third season i have the feeling that i want to make it here
4196606 i havent had a chance to speak with ars ne wenger but i have been training with the physio to improve my fitness levels i dont know if we will sit down and talk next week or the next but the most important thing is for me to be back working with the team

4196608 al final se ha impuesto la racionalidad y se va a retomar la propuesta original de chunta que era una propuesta que no implicaba ni pago de entrada ni coste para el ayuntamiento
4196609 es decepcionante porque no aporta nada de nada y no tiene nada que ver con las propuestas iniciales que hizo el alcalde para llevar conciertos y folklore junto al ebro adem s de abrir las plazas tem ticas
4196610 l conoc a perfectamente cu l era la situaci n econ mica del ayuntamiento de zaragoza y a pesar de ello lanz una propuesta inviable generando una ilusi n entre los ciudadanos a la que sab a que no podr a dar respuesta
4196611 ha demostrado que le importa m s generar expectaci n que valorar la realidad
4196612 la alta participaci n pol tica registrada durante el proceso de postulaciones tendr incidencia en la participaci n de la ciudadan a durante las elecciones
4196613 ya estamos por encima de las 13 mil postulaciones hay un gran inter s por participar por un lado hay mucha participaci n y por el otro stas ser n unas elecciones muy competitivas
4196614 ya que una candidata o un candidato puede tener seis o siete postulaciones en vista de que las diferentes organizaciones con fines pol ticos tienen la posibilidad de apoyar a una misma candidatura
4196615 el traje era un poco inc modo pero la sensaci n de nadar por debajo del agua es impresionante

4196617 estamos ante la demostraci n de que este negocio no resulta rentable tal y como est planteado y es la evidencia de que va a costar mucho dinero al ayuntamiento de zaragoza y a los zaragozanos en un futuro no muy lejano
4196618 las administraciones p blicas no pueden estar al servicio de negocios privados que no resultan rentables por mucho que sean un empe o personal de jer nimo blasco y del alcalde
4196619 nos encontramos ante un agravio sin precedentes hacia otros negocios privados de zaragoza que no han recibido ni una sola ayuda p blica por prestar sus servicios durante la expo
4196620 por qu no se hace lo mismo con otros empresarios por qu no se sortean viajes en los taxis tur sticos o comidas en los restaurantes o compras en el comercio de proximidad de la ciudad el ayuntamiento y expoagua ayudan a los amigos del alcalde y de jer nimo blasco si yo fuese hostelero o taxista exigir a igualdad de trato al ayuntamiento y a expoagua

4196628 what is it today the hair looking bad dress not matching bad slippers sleepy face
4196629 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4196630 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4196631 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4196632 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4196633 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4196634 two detainees suffered minor abrasions as a result of the alleged assaults
4196635 eight others were confined overnight in a detainee housing unit which was sprayed with a riot control agent and then the ventilation secured
4196636 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it

4196640 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4196641 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4196642 the russians will know where they are and what they are doing
4196643 putin is interested in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4196644 there needs to be some consequences for russias actions against a sovereign state
4196645 i think everyone will be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we go forward
4196646 it took years to get into the debacle that theyre in and its going to take years to get them out of it
4196647 but all the harvesting is done is like you see in the bible wheat is threshed by hand and hauled by donkeys

4196661 we are confident that the citizens of nashville will join dozens of other cities across the country that already have chosen to make english the official language of government operations and we are pleased that proenglish played a key role in giving them the opportunity to make that choice
4196662 the role of english as our common tongue must be protected this means rejecting the politically correct and divisive model of linguistic segregation
4196663 proenglish has supported the initiative to make english the citys official language by contributing our legal expertise and providing financial support and moral support

4196668 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4196669 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4196670 jeff schoenberg is the chairman of appropriations and hes helped us get into this financial mess by allowing the governor to raid the road funds and the tollway funds
4196671 as a matter of fact hes chaired a committee thats allowed 600 special funds to be raided including one for veterans and battered women
4196672 when i talk to people at events parades and at their doors theyre all telling me how unhappy they are with property taxes and sales taxes going higher and higher
4196673 some tell me they havent talked to a republican in years
4196674 were finding conservative republicans in places like evanston who say theyre excited that were giving them a chance to support a republican
4196675 one woman i spoke with had to sell her house because the taxes had increased to 24 000 a year she said she could afford the mortgage on the house she just couldnt afford the taxes
4196676 the democrats in control offer no solutions they need those taxes to pay for more programs
4196677 democrats shouldnt get away with putting these taxes on people who need to buy gas the most
4196678 it hits those who cant afford to live close to their jobs theyre the ones who pay the most in gas taxes those who drive the most get hit worse who do you think would pay the most if the governor gets his speeding cameras installed it will be the hard working people who are forced to drive the farthest
4196679 my opponent has chaired the appropriations committee and done nothing to stop this
4196680 we should have plenty to pay for state employee pensions and fund a capital program
4196681 this is nothing but a failure of leadership thats put us on a suicidal path of deficit spending
4196682 were pretty excited that there are close to 500 appel for senate yard signs on display in the district right now
4196683 people tell me good for you for challenging schoenberg weve got a lot of work to do but we think theres enough dissatisfaction in springfield that anything could happen in november
4196684 races like brendan appels are ones were excited about because we know surprises can happen in a year when voters are unhappy with the status quo
4196685 this could be a year like the one lasalles gary dahl had in 2004 when he ousted another key senate democrat
4196686 brendan appel is a knowledgeable candidate and a solid social and fiscal conservative
4196687 theres no question jeff schoenberg will be tough to knock off but it will take quality candidates like brendan to win in districts like the 9th and for republicans to regain the majority in the senate if we dont back good candidates like brendan well never balance the democrats in springfield
4196688 if i am elected id like to work on this property tax problem
4196689 im also interested in helping state senator matt murphy pursue the option for secession from corrupt cook county its time the city wasnt a leech on the hard working people in the suburbs

4196693 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence

4196729 newly arrived calves havent eaten since loaded on trucks therefore they are not generating body heat so providing bedding will help reduce heat loss when they lay down to rest
4196730 we use good hay then top dress with the starter ration prepared in the mill
4196731 we like to leave them as a general rule smith doesnt believe theres any benefit to processing calves sooner than 24 hours after arrival
4196732 we want calves to take that time to eat re establish rumen function rehydrate and rest to allow the immune system to recover from the stress theyve experienced if they arrive in the morning and look rested the following morning that would be an opportune time to process them if they are delivered in the afternoon or evening wed wait until the second morning to process them which would be closer to 36 hours in most cases if you delay processing too long it decreases many of the benefits we get from using vaccines
4196733 we need to vaccinate against viral diseases and treat for internal parasites
4196734 for higher risk calves that havent been weaned for 45 days or are commingled weve found a very positive benefit from vaccinating against mannheimia hemolytica infection high risk calves of auction origin will benefit from metaphylactic treatment in most cases this will be the vets call on a case by case basis for many ranch origin calves those entering natural programs dont have that option
4196735 its often difficult to predict whether or not these calves will have significant health problems based on how they look at arrival
4196736 typically calves that are commingled will experience more health problems we plan for disease outbreaks in these calves earlier in the receiving period than we do with ranch calves the primary tool to control brd in high risk commingled calves is still metaphylaxis
4196737 this is important to consider because if they still look good after the first 10 14 days we are often tempted to move the calves up on feed both in quantity and energy density as a result we can cause a respiratory break in these calves due to the nutritional management
4196738 by that time we can safely move most groups of calves up to levels of feed intake to achieve the gain desired for their weight and projected marketing date
4196739 if it doesnt look like they are drinking enough water there are other strategies that can be used to attract calves to the water such as using squirters over the water tank which makes a noise to attract curious calves or anything else that attracts calves to the water even letting the tanks overflow temporarily can help attract calves to the water tank
4196740 they are generally not price leaders they are more likely price followers
4196741 commodity trading advisors who give advice on managed futures accounts have shifted from long to short with the trend shift in price
4196742 we have seen redemptions from our client base but they have been relatively contained
4196743 its hard to be long when commodities have fallen around 10
4196744 i dont think there is an exodus of funds from the market i think the index funds still have significant assets in commodities and continue to grow
4196745 the conservation habits that have set this reduced demand into motion are not likely to be reversed
4196746 this newly acquired ability to absorb seemingly bullish international headlines has apparently been replaced by a market environment in which clear evidence of actual production disruptions of significant magnitude will be required to sustain price advances similar to those of the first half of this year
4196747 a significant rise in pork values has been led by strong prices for export items such as trimmings hams and picnics
4196748 the rise in prices for these items indicates continued strong export demand into august
4196749 with pork production running 9 percent over last year exports have been the clear driver for improved u s pork prices
4196750 exports continue to provide critical support for producers who need to cover sharply higher input costs
4196751 liver prices increased dramatically as russia started bidding against egypt for the limited supply of u s beef livers
4196752 liver prices have risen to more than 70 cents per pound compared to less than 20 cents per pound last year this has added roughly 7 per head on a live animal basis
4196753 we believe it makes sound business sense to join a patent estate for nuclear transfer that has been tested and is recognized as dominant with a leading operating company in the field
4196754 we have built a world class team of cloning practitioners and have key industry relationships in place
4196755 we are now creating a company that holds the proprietary intellectual property and has demonstrated operating leadership in the field customers can secure a license to practice or contract cloning services
4196756 we felt like it was becoming more important to document the age of the cattle were selling so that we could sell cattle into the international market i did a lot of research and i know that the japanese and others are really concerned about health issues in beef so it became apparent that we needed to provide them with cattle that we can prove their age
4196757 cattle must be sired by a registered angus bull calves must be enrolled by the ranch of origin and at minimum must have a record verifying the birth date of the oldest calf within the enrollment group
4196758 this is really an inexpensive program for ranchers to participate in
4196759 the one issue that dominated the attention of the u s beef industry in recent years was export market accessibility
4196760 when we lost many of our beef exports markets several years ago its estimated the u s beef industry was losing 3 5 billion per year or roughly 150 for every fed steer and heifer marketed each year
4196761 without question the most restrictive export requirements imposed on us are from japan
4196762 not only are detailed and descriptive processing procedures and record keeping required but all beef and beef products marketed to japan must be obtained from cattle determined to be 20 months of age or younger at harvest
4196763 for farmer feeders who market directly to packers angussource offers a feedyard umbrella program for ranch enrolled calves
4196764 in addition our commercial programs department is working with auction markets throughout the country to organize special angussource sales
4196765 i can see this really being helpful for us down the road
4196766 one of the powerful attributes of angussource is that it also enhances a producers ability to comply with requirements of programs like country of origin labeling cool and national animal identification system nais
4196767 through angussource ranchers are learning first hand the benefits of being involved in the marketplace
4196768 we have a severe liquidity crisis weve managed to cause it i take full responsibility for what has occurred
4196769 were hoping well resolve the issue with cargill and the banks simultaneously in a best case scenario on monday in a worst case in the next week or two
4196770 we simply failed to develop a clear enough consensus as to what to do to move rapidly enough
4196771 the loss unrealized and realized was about 45 million and on some days with the market open that changed by 12 million this was moving too fast this is a brand new company we didnt have a clear plan on how to react
4196772 thats my failure and i take full responsibility for it
4196773 it appears biofuel will be able to navigate its liquidity constraints without being forced to pursue other restructuring options
4196774 however its extremely delicate financial position and management credibility issues which were previously considered to be two strengths of the company are expected to continue to overhang the shares
4196775 double digit levels year on year with producers responding to strong industry profitability over the past nine months
4196776 despite the bullish eia report and the georgian russian conflict market participants still remain concerned over demand amid slowing economies which is limiting gains
4196777 it is clear the economic slowdown is a global phenomenon including china which has been one of the driving forces for oil prices over the past few years
4196778 this week georgia gave some support to oil otherwise we would have gone directly to 110 or 108 we stopped a few dollars above it proved to be a support
4196779 a recovery in oil prices over the last couple of weeks has been repeatedly hampered by players seeking protection against the downside through the purchase of puts amidst decidedly bearish sentiment
4196780 the sales of these puts have come with their corollary hedging sales of futures by those who sold the puts as prices weakened
4196781 the futures price would need to move sufficiently above these threshold strikes before option expiry to avoid being dragged down by incremental hedging activity
4196782 that the eia said eduardo lopez senior global demand analyst at the iea in paris with china leading global demand growth in recent years and continuing to do so in 2009 some analysts have deemphasized the impact of the u s on the world oil market

4196787 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4196788 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 per cent
4196789 the six month survival rate was 100 per cent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 per cent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
4196790 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead
4196791 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites
4196792 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organisations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
4196793 we can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon
4196794 as well as being a critical resource for government ministries the internet also plays an important role in the running of countries and this disruption can damage economies

4196798 the united states of america stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia it is time for this crisis to end
4196799 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4196800 it was underlined that the document should finally be signed by the georgian side as was agreed in moscow the french minister assured that paris is working on this
4196801 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4196802 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come he said at a pentagon news conference
4196803 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4196804 gm will act as a catalyst a facilitator and a conduit to support the development and sharing of the latest technology to address energy and environmental issues confronting the asean region
4196805 june was a bit of an exception in terms of economic growth because of the farm strike and the truckers strike which started to impede economic activity in the latter part of the month
4196806 the tendency from now on will be for the economy to grow at about 6 5 annually
4196807 argentina had been growing so quickly partly because it had so much unused production capacity but that capacity has now largely reached its limit so growth will slow
4196808 no matter what happens argentine growth will slow at current investment levels
4196809 in june the conflict began to hit the real economy
4196810 it hurt credit and consumption revenue from the value added tax was pretty bad in june but the senate vote injected a breath of fresh air into society in the second half of the month
4196811 reuters is deeply disturbed by a conclusion that would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
4196812 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4196813 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4196814 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
4196815 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4196816 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4196817 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4196818 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4196819 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4196820 as we enter the 2008 mens soccer season we celebrate the coaching career of a true spartan
4196821 damon possesses the leadership and coaching qualities that will prove successful during a smooth and celebrated transition in addition to playing at michigan state hes been joes right hand man for the past nine seasons and understands all that is required to build and maintain a successful spartan soccer program
4196822 i have truly loved coaching soccer at michigan state university
4196823 i feel blessed to have done so for 32 years looking back on my career if i had to do it all over again id do it exactly the same way
4196824 it is now time for a young vibrant enthusiastic coach to lead the spartan soccer program
4196825 i am very fortunate to have spent the last nine years with joe
4196826 he has taught me a great deal about running a division i program both on and off the field
4196827 i am excited and honored to be named the next head mens soccer coach at michigan state university my main focus right now is to put all my time and effort to ensure that joe and the 2008 team have an enjoyable and successful season
4196828 the fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible
4196829 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia

4196831 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4196832 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4196833 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4196834 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4196835 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4196836 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4196837 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space

4196857 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4196858 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4196866 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
4196867 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
4196868 it is possible that testing for this abnormal expression may become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
4196869 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer

4196879 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4196880 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4196881 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4196882 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4196883 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4196884 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4196885 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits
4196886 more web sites are adopting recaptchas each day so the rate of transcription keeps growing
4196887 more than 4 million words are being transcribed every day it would take more than 1 500 people working 40 hours a week at a rate of 60 words a minute to match our weekly output
4196888 we are demonstrating that we can take human effort human processing power that would otherwise be wasted and redirect it to accomplish tasks that computers cannot yet solve
4196889 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4196890 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4196891 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4196895 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
4196896 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4196897 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4196898 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4196899 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease

4196910 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4196911 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease

4196913 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4196914 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4196915 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4196916 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4196917 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it

4196959 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4196960 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4197197 employees other than reeco and bechtel are covered eg amp g and wackenhut are included and im told other contractor or subcontractor employees may be identified as the department of labor processes claims
4197198 again the reeco and bechtel mentioned in the bulletin is not an exhaustive list of covered contractors or subcontractors eg amp g special projects was a dod not doe contractor and thus they are not covered
4197199 just because you were a dod contractor doesnt mean you didnt get exposed to radiation

4197214 the difference is this wannstedt is making a mockery of a historically strong college program in spite of bringing in some top flight players robinson is making a mockery of su with a bunch of chumps so while you can give wannstedt credit for his recruiting i ultimately penalize him for fooling guys into thinking theyre playing for a winner when in reality theyre joining a team that would be a winner if it had a different coach quite ironic isnt it
4197215 yeah well at least we dont have top flight players

4197332 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
4197333 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
4197334 it is possible that testing for this abnormal expression may become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
4197335 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer

4197337 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest

4197339 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4197340 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it

4197429 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4197430 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4197431 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4197442 it seems that were on an upward trend this year
4197443 this is good news especially for a state like michigan
4197444 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4197445 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the us dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro

4197451 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4197452 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4197453 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4197454 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4197455 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4197456 the studio marriage of heidi newfield and producer tony brown is a match made in heaven
4197457 a lucinda williams cover cuts by george strait favorite dean dillon and evocative music row outsider lori mckenna and numerous co writes by newfield whos no mean songstress herself all in the hands of veteran producer tony brown set a commendably high standard even if what am i waiting for doesnt quite live up to its lofty aspirations
4197458 what am i waiting for captures the essence of traditional country females such as tammy wynette making for a refreshing oasis in a landscape of polished pristine pop country music unlike the images churned out on music row life isnt always airbrushed and pretty and newfields music is about accepting life and her past without resignation but with responsibility and hope
4197459 a startlingly sensitive fully rounded album that reveals heretofore unheard dimensions in both heidis personality and her talent
4197460 there isnt a lot of mainstream country music made these days that seems to speak for and to actual adults heidi newfields first solo album attempts to fill that void and she has crafted an album that could only have been made by a woman who has a lot of living behind her but still quite a bit to go
4197461 newfield is far from a one trick pony making one of the years best country albums
4197462 i think her song is awesome and i think anyone who bashes her is retarded and j
4197463 the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the west coast is surplus refining capacity supply significantly exceeds demand year round this results in very poor refining margins and very poor refinery financial results

4197465 this grant will significantly strengthen the ability of the indiana ctsi to implement its programs to swiftly bring the benefits of research to patients in indiana and beyond

4197467 the cost of higher education can seem insurmountable for many families
4197468 some students see the annual price tag and think thats it i cant go to college with our estimator we can combat that myth and provide students an immediate idea of what their costs will be and what kinds of grants scholarships loans and other funding options will help them meet those costs we believe it will help many more students recognize that purdue is a realistic option

4197486 hay una uni n entre el poder pol tico y una justicia absolutamente dependiente que a un a o del hecho se retroceda a la primera instancia es un golpe como cuando se lo liber a varizat vuelve a confirmar que por ahora no volver a la justicia ni ser juzgado lo que se demuestra es la justicia dependiente si fuera un hijo de vecino ya hubiera sido juzgado
4197487 ante todo vuelvo a insistir en el mensaje que nosotros dimos el a o pasado que no podemos tener entre nosotros ni un herido mas hay ciertas situaciones que nos crean sentimientos de impotencia de impunidad de atropello
4197488 exigir a la justicia que sea la garante de la paz social
4197489 me he informado en el tribunal superior de justicia de estos temas y otros m s tenemos que seguir creyendo y seguir animando y apuntalando para que estos casos se resuelvan lo antes posible es evidente que dilatar las cosas crea rispideces

4197493 the auditors reporting model a literature overview and research synthesis
4197494 the auditors report is the primary communication of the work performed that the public sees
4197495 we decided to take an in depth look at what is out there
4197496 this is a historical walk of the auditors report looking at what the research has shown us about the auditors reporting model in terms of every step from the time auditors evaluate the companys financial assertions and gather evidence to examining that evidence to coming up with a final decision the opinion and then providing the information to the public
4197497 we wanted to see what researchers have found concerning the relevance of the auditors information
4197498 matters such as the auditor client relationship litigation risk negative press coverage and the way in which auditors receive audit evidence can impact the overall reporting decision
4197499 that gets into the complexity of the process its not just a stand alone process for the auditors themselves but there are a lot of external factors that play a part in the way in which the information is processed and in the ultimate decision
4197500 if its rules based then auditors have something to follow this leads to less aggressive financial reporting and not much wiggle room for the auditor
4197501 however principles based standards may be better because youre improving the quality of the audit by allowing that expertise or judgment to come into play to help determine the true underlying picture of the company
4197502 right now the auditors report is a report card of pass or fail and thats the level of information that is being provided
4197503 our research is showing that theres truly a lack of communicative value coming through via the auditors report
4197504 the key here is to make the auditors report become more transparent regarding the audit process
4197505 were talking about more disclosures more details about the auditors process for example what are the findings that the auditors are coming up with companies have these immaterial and material misstatements that the auditors detect but why not also disclose some of those findings
4197506 a lot of people who read financial statements and look at the auditors report might not know that it does not provide absolute assurance that they have uncovered all the material misstatements people will read the report and find that a pass report is good news but that is not a 100 guarantee
4197507 most people when they think of water they think of brushing their teeth or doing their dishes and the reality is water is very much an industrial commodity
4197508 on what we would call the equipment and technology side of the industry is where you get some of your more aggressive plays
4197509 a couple of companies we like on that side would be
4197510 the decline in real estate investment trusts reits has been sharp reacting to the mortgage crisis and the associated financial meltdown however here are sectors of the real estate market that have not been affected by the mortgage crisis
4197511 such sectors like health care and multi family projects and self storage buildings are relatively less sensitive to the economic cycle in addition these sectors may have an inverse benefit from foreclosures such as rental properties and self storage
4197512 the neuberger berman real estate securities income trust fund invests in reits in defensive areas such as health care and multi family projects common stocks of reits are trading at a discount to the properties they own a reversal of premiums evident in last year
4197513 this closed end fund trades at 9 discount to its net asset value in essence a shareholder gets a portfolio of reits that trade at a discount to their real estate value at another discount the funds top holdings are ventas inc 5 7 omega healthcare investors 4 8 and nationwide health properties 4 8
4197514 the excellent rating says we continue to have teachers who work in partnership with students and parents to meet the curriculum expectations that we have
4197515 their diligence and hard work continues to help kids succeed
4197516 right now its of concern that we have to pass ayp this year
4197517 otherwise that would be the third year missing and they can reduce you a level so we could go from excellent to effective we need to identify these kids and work with them
4197518 i dont want to say there is a magic solution here i am not going to provide false promises i am not going to provide false guarantees about there being some simple solution
4197519 i am trying to turn around a situation which has evolved over many many years and we are dealing with the real consequences of climate change
4197520 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4197521 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4197522 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4197523 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4197524 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
4197525 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
4197526 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
4197527 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
4197528 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
4197529 although its more like a one two three four punch
4197530 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
4197531 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water
4197532 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality
4197533 algae suffering from lead poisoning like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins
4197534 what companies cant do is to fire employees randomly close stores and stop advertising thats the one thing most companies do but all of a sudden youre off the air and that much less top of mind those knee jerk reactions get companies into a lot of trouble they lose revenues
4197535 management should clean up operations and seek out ways to be more efficient
4197536 its really amazing how peoples behavior has changed in the last three of four months
4197537 for example take how people act at gas stations with convenience stores
4197538 on the one hand yes consumption might be going down
4197539 but on the other hand you might also see customers staying at your establishment longer
4197540 if theres something you can do as a marketer to ensure they keep coming back do it
4197541 part of this is just planning for an economic downturn
4197542 people at some point realized the middle class had shrunk and the two ends had expanded companies need to be there for all of the different segments
4197543 inexpensive fashion items are red hot right now with everyone from hollywood stars to designers embracing fashion forward concepts
4197544 at the upper end its not immediately obvious that theres any reduction in consumer spending yet
4197545 a 12 drop on wall street is just not enough for people who have a great deal of disposable income to exhibit radical changes in consumer behavior so far what i am reading mostly indicates heightened price consciousness but not a total refusal to spend
4197546 and then you have value expressive products which are intended to show some kind of status the real issue for companies arises when people are considering trading down in the experiential goods category because theyre not going to trade down in the expressive goods clothing jewelry because of self image people are not as likely to change those behaviors
4197547 i went safe and couldnt take risks for the team test
4197548 we hoped we would be steady with all three rides
4197549 i had hoped for a bit more but had to think about my team for a safe score
4197550 she started spooking at something on the side of the ring
4197551 it took me totally by surprise midway i knew there was no hope
4197552 one low score and the team is gone like with the u s with four its more exciting
4197553 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4197554 i didnt expect it would be easy to win but i didnt expect this either
4197555 so what is there to be afraid of in competition
4197556 the weight of representing your country at the world championships and at the olympics is different its much heavier here
4197557 i couldnt turn the support of the fans into a strength for me
4197558 when you become powerful and rich you get picked on people start to pay attention to you
4197559 the chinese want to be rich and strong and respected but theres a downside
4197560 the chinese leadership may regret opening china with the olympics
4197561 marvels of imagination that few countries would have the nerve or the money to attempt
4197562 the rise of china is by no means guaranteed the chinese economy could collapse the chinese government could collapse society could implode
4197563 the government has come to see that focus on gdp growth and economic development will no longer be sufficient to deliver its promise of serving the people
4197564 a top down process like economic reform was 30 years ago
4197565 of course those cases were all thrown out but its a beginning
4197566 government officials have come to see that universal practices such as elections decision by votes access to information accountability and rule of law are an integral part of any government that seeks to protect its legitimacy and sustain its rule of the people
4197567 does the u s fight it follow it get out of the way
4197568 political stability in china is of extreme importance for china and the world and the only way for long term stability is democracy
4197569 i tend to believe that human beings have tried to experiment with all types of political systems and that the best so far is a kind of western american style pluralistic democracy the future of china will head in that direction
4197570 by no means is that a guarantee of when itll start or whether it will be a success
4197571 i dont think china is moving toward democracy any time soon if we define it in western american european terms
4197572 the buzzword for this conference is innovation and i always attach that to the word leadership donaldson told the students and faculty in attendance
4197573 they needed in depth research and analysis more akin to what traditional management consulting firms provided to their clients
4197574 not for the boss not for the marketplace but to satisfy ones inner self if you will
4197575 put it all on red or black and let it ride
4197576 thats the distinction between a real entrepreneur and a wheeler dealer
4197577 theres a lot of talk about the ceo or coo or some other job label which tends to identify one person who just thinks great thoughts and strategies and one person who executes details and makes it work
4197578 the true entrepreneur can think and act on both levels
4197579 no matter how dark it gets they feel theyll find a way out of it thats an infectious quality
4197580 but the internal joy of running any enterprise that is really turned on if youre going to spend your waking hours doing something you better consider it serious business but fun to attack it
4197581 its not about breaking rules its about questioning and observing the system youre in
4197582 whats most important in a corporation or entity or organization public or private is the moral dna
4197583 a sense of integrity that grows deeper and more ingrained and is shaped by experience
4197584 we have some serious financial issues in this country and were just beginning to face them
4197585 does the american wedding tell us about the rest of american life
4197586 the way we marry reveals a great deal about prevailing cultural expectations of love hopes for marriage and sense of the role of family
4197587 weddings have become the single most visible expression of a persons social standing and wealth an expression that is both acceptable and expected
4197588 the future large discoveries in africa are not going to be found in south africa
4197589 they say that mining exploration starts at zero every 20 years because of new technology
4197590 but all the technology in the world is not going to make a resource any bigger resources are finite and thats the biggest challenge we face new technology cant change that
4197591 theyre pretty to look at but im not quite sure what they can do for me
4197592 where do we have the best chance of finding something attractive ultimately its a global decision
4197593 650 million chinese women didnt know to say if you love me give me an engagement ring now they do and now 650 million men need to come up with the money
4197594 china will have to urbanize 500 million people in the next 15 to 20 years
4197595 fifty to 70 tier one to tier three cities will need to be built
4197596 will certainly have a material impact on the commodity cycle
4197597 there have been times when ive thought my diamonds are better in the ground than out in the market because im not getting the price i want
4197598 ranks with russia as the most prospective geography on the planet
4197599 theres no infrastructure and its very expensive to explore its potential will remain unrealized for now
4197600 is one tribe with one language im not sure much of africa is ready for democracy only 50 years post colonization
4197601 you cant tell a country what their leadership should be who do you side with people should change governments not mining companies
4197602 when the chinese make an investment they bring in a large amount of their own resources to exploit that asset effectively
4197603 they are willing to pay more to fuel that growth engine
4197604 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4197605 he didnt want to back but that is what he signed up to do i saw the pain in his eyes
4197606 he was crying about the things he had seen i had never seen tears in my brothers eyes but that time in the pub i will never forget it
4197607 he loved football he was always always happy everyone loved his company
4197608 signaller wayne bland was a superb soldier full of character and a highly popular member of 16 signal regiment
4197609 it was abundantly clear to everyone who met wayne that his strength and personality marked him out for a bright future in the army

4197615 onze moeder heeft ons geleerd te waarderen wat we hebben gekregen zij zou een 14 jarige nooit stimuleren om iets te laten veranderen aan haar lichaam
4197616 verschrikkelijk dat mensen zich altijd focussen op negatieve aspecten en dat sommige mensen hun eigen leven blijkbaar zo moe zijn dat ze het nodig vinden om leugens over andere mensen te verspreiden

4197673 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations

4197695 i know that there have been talks from the sdl soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua party on an awareness program
4197696 we have not been officially approached by the sdl and if that is to take place it is up to the members of the conference to decide

4197698 all i can say is that mr bossleys appointment has been terminated
4197699 i think his removal is for the better because since his appointment he was not able to deliver anything
4197700 this is a very good decision and mr bossleys replacement should take his cue that if they do not work dialogue or negotiate it will not be accepted

4197706 we will elect a new president for the next three years
4197707 those eligible are ministers ordained with more than 10 years experience their names would be put and the people will select
4197708 a shortlist of three or four names will then be taken up at the conference and secret ballot will be held
4197709 the leader should be a visionary who can lead the church in the right direction
4197710 it is important because the church moves the nation when the methodist church moves the nation moves
4197711 a cabinet decision endorsed duty reduction on motor spirit unleaded petrol premix outboard fuel and diesel these duty reductions have resulted in the adjusted retail prices
4197712 the reduction is an example of the government carrying out its social responsibility
4197713 for example motor spirit had its price increase from the previous 2 16 litre to 2 44 litre
4197714 sees the pump price fall to 2 32 consumers still are forking out an extra 16 cents
4197715 it is understandable that in the field of social welfare we all do get frustrated with people and we say things that may be inappropriate he said
4197716 what is needed is a more equitable distribution of wealth and for the state to honour its commitment to the poor when vat was introduced
4197717 the world bank and international monetary fund when marketing the trade liberation concept engineered the idea of vat as a method of meeting the basic social services of health education and welfare affecting the poor
4197718 at the time of the introduction of vat this was the undertaking given by the state which led to a group from the social services sector to endorse vat
4197719 it is the peoples right to have the intervention from the state to get them out of poverty
4197720 first and foremost it would be the honor of having laura remembered in such a noble cause
4197721 i think lauras death epitomizes the need for such a law i truly believe that laura would be with us today had this bill been passed prior to september 2007
4197722 although the risks of the abortion procedure are downplayed by the abortion industry there are many complications cervical injury perforated uterus infertility subsequent ectopic pregnancy placenta previa premature delivery and miscarriage
4197723 repeat abortions and those performed after 12 weeks are especially risky
4197724 the bill gives a woman considering abortion the right to know the medical risks of abortion its alternatives and nonjudgmental scientifically accurate medical facts about the development of her unborn child before making this permanent and life affecting decision
4197725 we will continue to monitor this nomination its positive that the honaker nomination hasnt moved forward but we wont take anything for granted
4197726 while some groups suggest that mr honaker is a one issue ideologue we can assure you that such is not the case
4197727 mr honaker will serve wyoming and our country with distinction and he deserves prompt consideration by the senate judiciary committee
4197728 i recognize the right to privacy and i recognize the precedent of the united states supreme court
4197729 that is the law of the land and i would apply it
4197730 the nomination of richard honaker is consistent with the kind of judges president bush has appointed the to federal courts in the past hes someone who will uphold the rule of law and not engage in political advocacy from the bench
4197731 because of his pro life views and past efforts to protect human life its obvious that richard honaker joins with attorneys on both side of the abortion debate who understand that roe v wade was an example of unadulterated judicial activism and that the role of the courts is to interpret the law not make it up as you go
4197732 the explicit backstop might buy them enough time to earn their way back to good health
4197733 the best solution is that they manage to muddle through
4197734 at the end of the day if you told mr paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke that two years from now fannie and freddie would be solvent and not tap the government theyd take that over any other option
4197735 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units and auctioned off

4197737 much more of a risk in the euro zone than in the u s given role of unions in setting wages particularly in germany

4197750 this seems to be a problem again a few months ago we were dealing with this on an almost daily basis but when we started catching up with them they stopped so we relaxed our monitoring
4197751 it is not our fault that fishermen choose to intentionally hoodwink fishing wardens
4197752 every morning we wake up our vehicles verandahs and floors are covered with soot this is no longer something that the fsc can take lightly
4197753 we dont understand why they still have not come up with technology to control emission
4197754 every day is clean up day we are tired of cleaning every day because soot dirties everything sometimes we cant hang out the laundry
4197755 we wrote to the council on august 4 but weve not received a reply
4197756 we know the soot problem appears every crushing season whats important is that we are trying to do something about it
4197757 we are going to modify our boilers to control emissions of soot

4197771 what id like to do is serve two terms ive been a believer in term limits i actually tried to pass a term limit bill in my first term
4197772 the negative impressions were caused by absolute distortions that were drilled by heavy spending and i didnt have the kind of money to counter balance that in a statewide election but in a mayoral campaign its actually affordable between personal appearances and direct mail
4197773 and there havent been any changes in short my policy wasnt different than former democratic governor jim florio he passed the laws and enforced them well
4197774 i was mayor we worked very aggressively to get illegal guns off the street and we were successful and violent crime and murder plummeted
4197775 if mr schundler thinks hes ok with doing what other administrations have done in the past i disagree entirely its up to me as a local mayor to do something about the carnage thats been wrought in this country by guns
4197776 it is not only the responsibility of the police or the government to eradicate marijuana it is a whole nation approach if we are to fight drugs

4197782 there are five scenes and our costumes and backdrops were all done in the village we managed to get a sponsorship of 300 from wakaya island resort and the community got together to raise more funds for the trip
4197783 the idea to join tadra kahani came about last year when we thought of coming out of school and exposing the students to something different
4197784 everyone has been excited and through our performance we hope our message has echoed loud and clear
4197785 i came to watch with my family and the show was just wonderful the students are very talented and they have worked very hard to put on a good show
4197786 this kind of event is good for the students especially for schools like nakelo the exposure is good and i am looking forward to next year
4197787 for example sexual offenders must be given appropriately severe penalties as necessary for these serious crimes along with counselling

4197795 people are slowly but surely realizing the power of markets
4197796 regulatory markets not only help you achieve your goals but help you achieve them more efficiently
4197797 if you want to sit on your rear end and do the same thing that your great grandfather did with the water thats fine
4197798 leads to a water system that is much more efficient than a situation where trading isnt allowed

4197803 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4197804 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4197805 its crazy this man rangel controls tax policy in the united states hes a lot bigger than just a regular member of congress he deserves more respect than this
4197806 basically they have told us they cant help us that there are too many obama supporters ahead of charlie on the line
4197807 we have a wealth of talent within our party and very limited speaking roles
4197808 i believe ex prisoners have already served their time why the double penalty
4197809 in my personal encounter with the individuals i believe most do always want to go back to prison because of the brotherly love and concern they got from inmates because out there they find no love and care due to stigma in society
4197810 most of them come out off prison reformed and converted and of course they do have the right to be treated equally and justly by everybody
4197811 lets give them a second chance they dont need to be punished again
4197812 why do we stigmatise our brothers and sisters and give them a hard time some people out there have committed similar crimes and offences but were never caught red handed or perhaps they were able to find a lawyer to defend them
4197813 most of the people look at academic performance and scoring the highest marks within the last three to four years within the suva region is quite an achievement
4197814 its good that they are here i was praying and praying that they would come and they did i want the best for my son but i could not afford it but these wonderful doctors are giving their best for free
4197815 i want my son to have full use of his eyesight because he is often the target of cruel mockery and he sometimes comes home crying
4197816 we come every year because there is a great need for our services in the northern division we know there is only one eye doctor serving about 150 000 people so we are concerned
4197817 the most common eye problem here is cataract because of the high exposure people in this division have to the sunlights ultra violet lights
4197818 other than that there are eye sight cases from birth and those related to non communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension
4197819 we continue to look at each other as christians or hindus or muslims
4197820 it is time to realise that we are part of a common humanity and the barriers of race colour and creed are but artificial boundaries which ignore our being different threads of the common fabric of mankind
4197821 he was held from behind by the neck with a knife on his neck and taken upstairs to the kitchen
4197822 in the kitchen they met the woman who came out after hearing the scuffle they also put a knife to her shoulder while the men ransacked the house and ran away
4197823 they subjected him to totally unwarranted indignities of forcing him to eat horse manure regardless of how heinous a persons conduct maybe neither police nor the armed forces have the right to punish a person for such conduct
4197824 this is a proper case for aggravated or exemplary damages as there was oppressive and high handed act on part of the solders
4197825 we believe that if we can simplify what we should do and harmonise how we do it we can do much more and much better provided of course that we work together he said

4197829 engkau telah mengatakannya akan tetapi aku berkata kepadamu mulai sekarang kamu akan melihat anak manusia duduk di sebelah kanan yang mahakuasa dan datang di atas awan awan di langit

4197838 setelah lewat hari sabat maria magdalena dan maria ibu yakobus serta salome membeli rempah rempah untuk pergi ke kubur dan meminyaki yesus
4197839 mengapa peribahasa ini terus disebut sebut di negeri israel orang tua makan buah anggur yang asam rasanya tetapi anak anaklah yang ngilu giginya demi aku allah yang hidup tuhan yang mahatinggi peribahasa ini tidak akan lagi diucapkan di israel nyawa setiap orang adalah milik ku baik nyawa orang tua maupun nyawa anaknya orang yang berdosa dialah yang akan mati
4197840 orang yang berbuat dosa dialah yang akan mati anak tidak harus menanggung akibat dari kesalahan ayahnya sebaliknya ayah pun tidak harus menanggung akibat dari dosa dosa anaknya orang yang baik akan mendapat ganjaran yang baik karena perbuatannya yang baik dan orang yang jahat akan menderita akibat dari kejahatannya
4197841 tinggal sesaat saja kalian tak akan melihat aku lagi dan setelah itu sesaat lagi kalian akan melihat aku
4197842 tinggal sesaat saja kalian tidak akan melihat aku lagi dan setelah itu sesaat lagi kalian tidak akan melihat aku
4197843 janganlah engkau memegang aku sebab aku belum pergi kepada bapa tetapi pergilah kepada saudara saudara ku dan katakanlah kepada mereka bahwa sekarang aku akan pergi kepada bapa ku dan bapamu kepada allah ku dan allahmu
4197844 dan jika kristus tidak dibangkitkan maka sia sialah kepercayaan kamu dan kamu masih hidup dalam dosamu
4197845 jika kamu mengaku dengan mulutmu bahwa yesus adalah tuhan dan percaya dalam hatimu bahwa allah telah membangkitkan dia dari antara orang mati maka kamu akan diselamatkan
4197846 mengapa kamu terkejut dan apa sebabnya timbul keragu raguan di dalam hati kamu 24 39 lihatlah tangan ku dan kaki ku aku sendirilah ini rabalah aku dan lihatlah karena hantu tidak ada daging dan tulangnya seperti yang kamu lihat ada pada ku

4197955 due to the unfortunate british august weather tomorrows inter parliamentary rounders competition has been postponed by elderman until wednesday 27th august
4197956 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4197957 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4197958 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4197959 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4197977 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4197978 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4197979 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4197980 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4197981 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4197982 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4197983 bangabandhu was uncompromising in realizing self rights by enduring oppression and torture his political farsightedness valour oratory and robust leadership had inspired the nation into the war of independence

4197991 btrc fined grameenphone for providing e1 connectivity to third parties enabling the use of voice over internet protocol voip which is illegal and unlawful and caused revenue loss to the government
4197992 during the investigation current md of grameenphone anders jensen and his team extended full cooperation gp has already made partial payment of the aforesaid amount and the balance will be deposited with the exchequer shortly
4197993 we hope that no telecommunications operator will facilitate any illegal voip ventures directly or indirectly the operators are expected to co operate with the government in preventing such activities in the future
4197994 no one will be spared if found involved in any capacity in the illegal call termination business
4197995 we deeply regret that such unlawful practices were carried out and not disclosed earlier by grameenphone
4197996 we have cooperated with btrc in the investigations and the grameenphone board also mandated an investigation by an external auditor to look into all aspects of our operations to ensure that we fully comply with all laws and regulations
4197997 only gun alone could not protect the forests and its resources

4198000 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4198001 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4198002 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4198003 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4198004 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4198005 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4198006 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4198007 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4198008 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4198009 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4198010 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4198011 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4198012 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4198013 who are open to doing something on the production side
4198014 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4198015 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4198016 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4198022 a lot of students who live up to a mile away would like to walk its also part of a wellness program for the schools
4198023 youve got kables mill and in my perspective those children ought to be walking to school its a mile
4198024 east of eden eden meadows afton woods eagle rise deerfield those communities are all walkable theyre within one to two miles of that school system with pathways the new developments on little sugarcreek are walkable
4198025 it fits our established goal of making a more livable community a more walkable community with more active transportation
4198026 will everybody walk and ride to school no but we can start the shift
4198027 the economy of the u s is changing and as the community moves forward theres going to have to be a shift in the way we move people around we need to make improvements in roads obviously but we also need the ability to walk or ride a bicycle or a moped
4198028 i cant paint my grease splattered kitchen or clear all the clutter until we do the remodeling and we cant remodel until we get new appliances and we cant buy new appliances until our ship comes in or i get my inheritance or i get a new job or the kids move out
4198029 debra you quit that moaning right this minute young lady i want you to get up get up and help those who have a harder life than yours get up and find what you have lost get up and create what you cannot afford ready made get up and find a new friend get up and find some inspiration get up and count your blessings
4198030 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4198031 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defence ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions this is a very important statement for easing tension
4198032 we are not looking to not do we need to take control of any air or seaports to conduct this mission
4198033 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4198034 i have heard threats that we are not going to be admitted to the world trade organization but we see clearly that nobody is going to admit us there anyway
4198035 sam gets to hide behind the camera i cant but i think hes planning on factoring that in
4198036 as like a major factor itd be a major liability you know ash runs out of breath or his back goes out and stuff like that i mean i just blew my hamstring fighting a stunt guy for burn notice the show that im doing now so theres a little bit of truth to all of that
4198037 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
4198038 the beauty of the evil dead movies is that youre only appealing to one demographic and thats people who like horror movies and you just have to please them you dont have to appeal to the studio youre already pleasing them by giving them part 4
4198039 the fact that its been 26 years since we last saw ash in army of darkness
4198040 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4198041 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4198042 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4198043 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4198044 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4198045 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4198046 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4198047 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4198048 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4198049 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4198050 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4198051 its the church everywhere in their lives they just cant see it
4198052 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4198053 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4198054 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4198055 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4198056 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4198057 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4198058 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4198059 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4198060 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4198061 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4198062 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4198063 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4198064 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4198065 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4198066 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4198067 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4198068 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4198069 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4198070 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4198071 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4198072 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4198073 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4198074 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4198075 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4198076 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4198077 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4198078 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4198079 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4198080 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4198081 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4198082 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4198083 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4198084 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4198085 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4198086 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4198087 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4198088 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4198089 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4198090 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4198091 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4198092 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4198093 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4198094 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4198095 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4198096 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4198097 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4198098 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4198099 i see a shadow black cast by a crumpled piece of paper
4198100 were a bunch of big kids and weve had our toy taken away we werent bothering anyone we werent stopping traffic none of us understand why they did it
4198101 we had several accidents and a bunch of near misses at that location
4198102 this was probably the best location in the country to shoot military aircraft
4198103 as i posted pictures on the internet i started getting e mails from people around the country and europe wanting to know where i had gotten those shots
4198104 i have no idea how long the practice has been going on
4198105 but we realized how serious it was and that we were liable to do something about it im sorry for them but its an extremely hazardous condition
4198106 the same prime viewing area enjoyed by the public also poses one of the most immediate threats to the security of the installation
4198107 although we cant remove every conceivable threat from all areas surrounding the base we are constantly working with local law enforcement agencies and municipal governments to at least reduce those threats
4198108 me imagino que la junta estar en plena fase de investigaci n y que estar en la idea de remitirla a esta fiscal a
4198109 si la junta no lo hace nosotros en funci n de la documentaci n que podamos recabar remitiremos los hechos a un juzgado de instrucci n para que abra una investigaci n que en su caso podr a derivar en un procedimiento penal
4198110 a n no hay petici n de pena contra l por parte de la fiscal a por lo que la presunci n de inocencia debe ir por delante

4198141 but if you make yourself more than just a man if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they cant stop you then you become something else entirely
4198142 19 young arabs acting at the behest of islamist extremists headquartered in distant afghanistan
4198143 the main purpose of our group right now is we want to get a canadian investigation into 9 11 in order to justify our war effort
4198144 if we dont have a reason we should pull out immediately
4198145 theyre very important for society because after an event like that just like the jews with the holocaust or the palestinian problem theres so much emotion involved that you need people that are going to kind of commemorate them the victims
4198146 because it was something that was so new and unexpected people cannot grasp the idea that a plane hit a building and the building collapsed that it can be that simple because it had so many implications and effects on our everyday life
4198147 but thats the way we mythologize these kinds of events and make meaning out of them
4198148 trilateralism at an end asymmetrical bilateralism restored canadian ambivalence on u s strategic primacy after 9 11
4198149 greatly increased u s demands for historically unprecedented bilateral cooperation in both military operations and national security surveillance and enforcement
4198150 to the extent that canadians have begun to share fears about a decline in world order and global security as well as a decline in relative american power the willingness to align canadian foreign and defense policies more closely with washington actually may increase

4198165 i believe the answer is the change of russian president the order is reported by the washington post to have come from russian president dmitry medvedev putins behavior in office has long struck me as matching historical conqueror behavior a recent economist article gave some reason to fear that putin was held the whip hand but it can also be explained by observance of a division of powers if so then medvedev deserves lots of credit for pulling back from putins aggressive habits i hope he will also keep the cold war from returning bernard kouchner frances foreign minister and cofounder of medicins sans frontieres and his people deserve tons of credit for being persistent and patient and making this a possibility i think hes been doing as good a job there as hes done for his legendary ngo
4198166 its important to keep something in mind that not everybody gets russia was beating georgia and rather thoroughly its not superior georgian arms that brought this georgia mightve eventually been able to score serious chechnya vietnam american revolution style points in the long term after a loss by reformatting their forces to go asymmetric but that wouldve been well in a hypothetical future there are no battles they won even in a pyrrhic sense unfortunately celebratory remarks of the georgian president suggest hes among those who think they won by arms which bodes just a tad badly what are your theories think russia saw the error of their ways that the russia where lifes cheap was bugged by its smallish losses

4198183 if it is down to ben ainslie and zach railey or somebody else for the gold medal then ben will kill them you could put your house on that you could put the nations houses on it
4198184 two portugese guys i did not know came up to me the other day and said how did ben get on i told them he had won and they laughed and said well everybody knows what will happen in the finn railey has sailed the races of his life but now the pressure is on ben is the sailor of our time the sailor of the moment
4198185 ben has an incredible talent for making the right tactical decisions at the right time and with such huge consistency
4198186 on the downward stage of one leg this week he moved up from eighth to second and then another time from seventh to first on the final leg most of the other boats stayed in their same positions but he has the ability to make moves like this even when there isnt much wind
4198187 its sheer talent schumacher was at one with his machine while being aware of all that was going on around him ben is the same even in these conditions he can pick out the little gusts of wind and use them to full advantage it is incredible
4198188 ben is not arrogant but i think he expects to win and he is very hard on himself
4198189 and i try never to dwell on the prospect of losing

4198193 the business class seat is marketed by singapore airlines as the most spacious the world has ever seen and whilst maybe not suited to every passengers taste it remains a clear quality benchmark for long haul business class

4198195 among those who jumped on the lakeland bandwagon discernment was discouraged
4198196 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4198197 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
4198198 it was an attempt to destroy the ossetian people to push them out of the territory of south ossetia that as mr saakashvili and probably some of his western sponsors believed would solve the problem with the separatist region and according to the documentary proof were now seeing they planned after that to conduct the same operation in abkhazia thats what has happened genocide is what has happened widespread physical destruction with artillery shells tanks and guns of thousands of russian citizens basically an ethnic cleansing operation was carried out
4198199 for several days the russian federation was conducting a military operation of peace enforcement that operation is now concluded successfully by that i mean that georgia is now no longer capable of repeating its military offensive in south ossetia or abkhasia and only now when the operation has been completed and its goals achieved can russian criminal investigators and other law enforcement officials work in the field to collect evidence which will then be presented to the international community along with corresponding accusations against the georgian leadership
4198200 the situation in south ossetia has been building for a long time was the russian military operation prepared in advance or was this operation started only after the reports came in of russian civilians and russian peacekeepers being killed
4198201 lets be rational if the russian federation had known in advance as you say that saakashvili had such insane plans then of course we would have acted accordingly and would at least have put our military forces directly along the border between russia and south ossetia and by the rockskiy tunnel between north and south ossetia in that case we could have responded within a couple of hours but naturally that didnt happen because we couldnt know about saakashvilis plans of course we needed some time about a day to send our troops to south ossetia to protect our citizens and peacekeepers and in that time georgian troops shelled a city without being challenged they fired on it with tanks and artillery they crushed children under tank tracks they burned women who were locked in sheds all in all they conducted genocide and ethnic cleansing
4198202 georgia claims it was defending itself and says its troops didnt target civilians in tshinvali
4198203 defending itself from what from the ossetian people at the moment when georgia unleashed its military action in the conflict zone there were about three hundred and fifty russian peacekeepers armed only with machine guns since no other weapons were allowed according to the ceasefire agreement then in place between russia and georgia for south ossetia there were no grads multiple rocket launchers and no tanks there it was peacekeepers and local civilians and a very small force dwarfed by the georgian army the military forces of south ossetia the number of soldiers was completely mismatched so who was it georgia was defending itself against it wasnt defending it was attacking and only after we sent our additional troops to reinforce the peacekeeping contingent and to start a peace enforcing operation only then did saakashvili cry out hysterically that russia was attacking him
4198204 what was the point of your strikes against targets outside the conflict zone targets in georgian territory including civilian targets according to eyewitnesses
4198205 eye witnesses i think its more something that president saakashvilis has said i wouldnt trust such eyewitnesses too much as many of them resemble too much goebbels propaganda trying to present white as black and vice versa trying to present a victim of an aggression as the initiator of the aggression and vice versa our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone instead they launched strikes in response to the georgian forces attacks such as artillery which were still targeting tskhinvali there was speculation panicky rumours and disinformation that russian tanks had allegedly entered gori stories of russian planes bombing tbilisi they were all goebbels style lies invented by the georgian leadership
4198206 why do you think not a single country except cuba supported the russian military action
4198207 in short its maybe simply because of double standards you see russia didnt really have a choice after what the georgian leadership did large numbers of our citizens were wiped out and no one can disprove that its a fact
4198208 in conclusion how solid do you think the ceasefire is that is now been established between russia and georgia
4198209 i hope it will hold i hope this time the georgian leadership will have enough sense not to repeat the adventures it has pursued lately i hope very much that the ceasefire will hold firm but ill repeat to ensure the ceasefire lasts we will take all necessary action for the security of our russian citizens living in south ossetia and abkhazia
4198210 what action precisely will the russian army stay in those internationally unrecognised republics
4198211 not the russian army but peacekeeping forces deployed there legitimately you have to agree theres a big difference and the difference is fundamental
4198212 well georgia can call them whatever it wants it wont change the reality

4198241 this is the portrait of total victory a living breathing expression of athletic supremacy michael phelps has been phenomenal thus far in the olympics making us proud at every turn as a former athlete i enjoy watching the olympics and the many sports in part because when athletes win the gold i can relate to the thrill of victory i understand the sacrifice the hours of practice the pain the commitment required to become an olympian let alone win a medal so i am completely impressed with the dominance of michael phelps the unparalleled prowess that is on display each and every time he slips his 6 foot four inch frame beneath the waves
4198242 i am equally impressed if not more so by his demeanor and carriage it is clear he commands the respect of his teammates and fellow swimmers he is a team player cheering on his teammates in the 4x100 relay with tremendous fervor celebrating triumph with them when they won his comments to reporters after winning are modest confidently humble hes clear that talking smack is unnecessary he does all his talking in the water when they won the relay and he roared in triumph i roared with him phelps is an obviously determined individual with a laser focus on what he has come to the olympics to do he is supplying thrills and inspiration to americans back home on his road to a history making 8 gold medal performance even more inspirational is watching him do it with class humility and true olympic spirit

4198299 turbulence caused by external factors is changing the automotive industry like never before and energy has become a major point of concern since it touches virtually every aspect of our lives
4198300 the global growth in demand for oil is outpacing its availability which will ultimately result in energy scarcity likely before we develop advanced energy technologies that will be enough to close the gap to the worlds energy demand
4198301 imagine we have developed advanced technologies for solar wind hydro energy and its storage sufficient enough to close the gap to the worlds energy demand
4198302 we need to improve our industrys readiness for upcoming change
4198303 if we do this right my deep belief is that this industry can go beyond that and be the leaders in developing the right solutions to address these complex energy and mobility challenges

4198371 how many observations should i make of each object it is most efficient to make two or three observations over a period of an hour or so per object per night observations of specific objects are best made on pairs of nearby nights as the accuracy of isolated single night observations can be difficult to judge by observing on pairs of nights any ambiguity is removed you should not make only one observation of each object per night neither should you make many more than three observations per objects per night it is a waste of your time and rarely helps the orbit solution however to make observations of a new discovery in groups many hours apart on a single night can be useful particularly in the case of an newly discovered object that may be close to the earth for multi opposition objects the preferable regimen of observing is observations on pairs on night in each dark run around each opposition until the object is numbered
4198372 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4198373 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest

4198375 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits

4198392 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4198393 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4198394 so how will mrs clinton who is a super delegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit to see if it unfolds as the obama campaign hopes free of acrimony tune in on wednesday aug 27
4198395 i cant care less about this delegate count we have more voters going for clinton however dnc discounts it
4198396 i cant believe it that obama has the thick thick to accuse mccain of flip flopping when he himself flip flops more times than my fingers can count in one hand

4198398 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4198399 we dont have any formal proposals before nascar or anything like that right now but that is what we presented today
4198400 we have done this realignment in the past we havent speculated on what track at all
4198401 clearly were in the business of running race events and we like the markets that were in but thats all i can really say
4198402 we believe in the project and kansas has been fantastically successful for us its been a great speedway for us and a real important speedway in our portfolio
4198403 even though it would be another 1 5 mile oval track but each of those tracks have their own character and as they get older they even take on more character
4198404 it would put on a good show and it would be great for the sport
4198405 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4198406 it could turn into a fuel mileage race at any time so you really have to be on your toes and be aware of what could happen
4198407 we were pretty good there in the spring race but came up short on the fuel mileage at the end
4198408 for me coming to michigan i tend to run well here for whatever reason and the biggest deal is trying to finish and finish up front
4198409 we ran toward the front there in june but we ended up making a late pit stop and with all the fuel mileage strategy that was going on we ended up getting shuffled back
4198410 weve had some great runs with the car that we are bringing this weekend so im hoping we can improve on our june finish
4198411 michigan is one of those places that you need the entire package to compete for the win
4198412 being successful has a lot do with the horsepower that is under the hood
4198413 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4198414 you have to have the right strategy when you come from the back
4198415 and david did a great job stopping us just at the right time so we could make it home on the gas
4198416 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs

4198418 we wanted a safe cream that we could put the caffeine into
4198419 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4198420 the biggest thing with michigan is the cars end up being pretty spread out and you have to have a car that turns well
4198421 clean air means a whole lot the track usually widens out and you have to have a car that can run on the bottom and the top wherever you need to go fuel always ends up being a big deal there just like it was in the spring we finished eighth or ninth but the guys in front of us all did it on fuel mileage it ends up being a pretty good deal trying to get that worked out for the race
4198422 we had a good car there last time but we didnt get to qualify because it rained
4198423 this is the same car we raced at indy it was new there it has some new features here and there that are better than what we had so were pretty excited
4198424 were trying to make the car lighter get more aerodynamic advantage over the car and under the car stuff like that
4198425 its just small things with the new car everybodys car is pretty close we have a little bit different suspension geometry package than what we had there last time we just keep evolving with these cars
4198426 the thing that people struggle with the most is getting the cars to turn well they punch a pretty big hole in the air and when you get in traffic and dont have any downforce on the front a lot of people struggle getting into the turns thats one of the things we work on the most you also have to have the back under it to where youre not loose getting in weve had pretty good success with it so far
4198427 the only thing you can do to save fuel is detune the engine to give up horsepower and get better mileage you dont want to do that but sometimes youre better off at least you want to get the mileage the other guys are getting
4198428 i felt like in the first race we got worse mileage than the other guys because we were going for all out power and trying not to give up anything well see how our mileage is this weekend
4198429 it can be hard on engines but normally you dont see too many engine failures
4198430 if you had to pick something the engine is the first thing in the first race it looked like we had a lot more brake wear than what we have had youd think a place thats as big and wide open as michigan is you wouldnt have a lot of brake wear but we did we got back last time and our brakes were used up we went to a different package this time to make sure we dont run out of pad
4198431 most of the time when the car doesnt turn the best you end up using the brakes to try to get it to turn
4198432 if your car is loose getting in youll use the brakes up trying to make yourself feel more comfortable youll end up riding the brake a little into the corner the handling part probably affects it more than anything else
4198433 it doesnt change anything as far as the team goes
4198434 its really cool that stanley and all those people are doing something like that knowing that if we do win that 1 million it will go straight to charity and help out a lot of kids
4198435 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4198436 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in

4198452 the victory over georgia has been handed down to nicolas sarkozy on a platter although he has already overhauled the points concerning conflict settlement which is sure to have the most devastating effect on russias geopolitical interests in the south caucasus
4198453 the russian leadership acted half heartedly russia failed to break georgias military machine and by agreeing to a ceasefire heavily compromised its punishment of the aggressor something so sternly demanded by russias defense ministry recently
4198454 the crew of the tu 22 that was shot down over georgia were sent to their death
4198455 the short lived act of georgian aggression has brought to light all the painful defects in the training and battle management of our troops as well as in decision making in a military period
4198456 when guns in this case georgian multiple rockets scream and roar it is truly bad form to wait for instructions from higher ups it is necessary to strike immediately at enemy bases and firing positions it is the abc of warfare

4198468 i think its a question of just how much is enough competition
4198469 if you look out of the uk youve already got 21 carriers operating scheduled services at the moment across the north atlantic
4198470 i think ba would argue that by reducing the number and synchronising services they could provide a more efficient operation and reduce costs
4198471 few of us thought that we would ever look back fondly at 90 a barrel oil
4198472 but as you all know the rise in the price of oil and by extension jet fuel has accelerated during the past several months to extraordinary levels

4198818 my family understands but the girlfriends just whine we both didnt realize we would be touring this much
4198819 but its a lot of hard work and touring and you have to put in the effort if you want to do something
4198820 we were on tour so much we didnt have time to record

4198826 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4198827 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4198848 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4198849 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4198850 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4198851 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4198852 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers

4198855 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4198856 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4198857 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america

4198900 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4198901 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4198902 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4198903 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4198904 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4198905 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4198906 we look forward to continuing our relationship with the university at albany and the city of albany

4198909 as a scientist medical or mental health professional i agree with the following conclusions about abortion
4198910 some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow
4198911 it is time for the world to hear the truth about our pain abortion hurts women and we will be silent no more
4198912 description of all known medical risks of the procedure and statistically significant risk factors to which the pregnant woman would be subjected including i depression and related psychological distress ii increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide
4198913 healthcare professionals who assess or refer women who are requesting an abortion should assess for mental disorder and for risk factors that may be associated with its subsequent development
4198914 the royal college of psychiatrists recognizes that good practice in relation to abortion will include informed consent consent cannot be informed without the provision of adequate and appropriate information regarding the possible risks and benefits to physical and mental health
4198915 given that the supreme court the 8th circuit the british royal academy of psychiatrists 100 american scientists medical and mental health professionals and 3000 post abortive women and men agree that abortion can potentially severely hurt women we want that truth to be recognized by the american psychological association
4198916 considering the monetary tightening since may the committee believes that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflation
4198917 it is unexceptionable that some women will come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow

4198922 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4198923 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover

4198928 and obamas tire gauge mini crusade was a mortifying misfire with those same voters a shiny little gadget specializing in the literally lightweight issue of air versus the greasy brawny push for massive phallic drilling into the seabed of mother earth symbols matter

4198930 the agreement concerns chemical processes that can capture carbon dioxide from the process industry and emissions from coal and gas powered power stations

4198933 for wang wei to claim that the beijing olympics has led to greater respect for human rights is an outrageously absurd statement
4198934 the organizers have simply not delivered on their promises of complete media freedom they also continue to detain potential protesters even as they ostensibly allowed protest zones in beijing just like the fake digital fireworks or the insulting singing girl trick at the opening ceremony this is another embarrassing proof that the chinese communist party is trying cover up reality and abusing these games for its own propaganda purposes
4198935 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4198936 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4198937 georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
4198938 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4198939 a u s air force c 17 aircraft with humanitarian supplies is on its way and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4198940 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4198941 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
4198942 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4198943 researching and improving the use of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in our vehicles is a long term priority for the u s
4198944 with continued investment hydrogen holds the potential to help fundamentally change the way we power our vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
4198945 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4198946 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result

4198956 theyre not familiar with the area these people got on the trail and they started walking on the trail they dont know the geography of it they didnt have a guide with them
4198957 its a horrible thing i cant even imagine how the parents will feel
4198958 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4198959 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4198960 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4198961 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4198962 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4198963 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4198964 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits
4198965 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4198966 hello nice to see you we are the god dammed f amp king stooges
4198967 they have raised consumer expectations of how much control they should have over their media choices we havent seen that kind of innovation in the magazine space sending seven or eight renewal notices in the mail and saying time to write a check that seems like an antiquated way to do things
4198968 the model were following is a lot like cable tv
4198969 youve got real consumers spending real money and making their decisions in a magazine centric environment
4198970 this offers a good positive economic return for the publishers but theres always a question of where that should be
4198971 in a jump ball situation then yes time inc titles would get some preference
4198972 but maghound will be trying to maximize maghounds revenues not time inc s revenues
4198973 my feeling is people who sign up will forget about it and the magazines will keep coming whether they want them or not
4198974 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
4198975 nothing resembling proof here just idle speculation from my fevered mind but i think that it is so so youre just going to have to believe me
4198976 yeah misha you just go ahead noooo dont worry about putin if he as much as stirs president bush will launch an all out nuclear strike on moscow the next day what would i an advisor to a candidate for the presidency lie to you heck bush and i are so buddy buddy that i pick lauras lingerie for her yep thats right so go ahead now move right into south ossetia

4198980 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4198981 maybe the law of averages if i play him enough hes bound to have an off day against me once
4198982 i cant be more elated that it happened at the olympics
4198983 estoy convencido que honrar la hist rica campa a de la senadora clinton de esta manera nos ayudar a celebrar este momento decisivo de nuestra historia y unir al partido

4198987 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4198988 i miss you in a way that makes it hard for me to breathe sometimes the more time that passes since our breakup the more i realize just how very much i love you
4198989 its hard to know the specific reasons why people abandon treatment but there are lots of patients with low weight and nutrition problems
4198990 visibly weak those who come from families with no possessions and those who are too feeble to work
4198991 talking about nutrition in mozambique is extremely complex because the question of lack of food does not only affect hiv positive patients
4198992 we urge you to include provisions in this bill which address the needs of children in communities of color and respectfully request a meeting with you to discuss this critical issue
4198993 we had a worse bill based on an argument that had no credibility members of congress are going to have to decide whether they want to put children first or put partisan politics first
4198994 we think this implements the shared responsibility concept that was the hallmark of health care reform
4198995 it makes sense to us to say to companies that offer minimal or no benefits you have to make a small contribution
4198996 i totally think my time with high school musical will be over after the 3 drops

4198999 its the sharing of information with strangers that concerns mothers like addie swartz ceo of the media company b tween productions and a mother of two teenage daughters
4199000 i believe its a great outlet if youre older and more mature but you are opening yourself up to the world and you have to be prepared for that
4199001 i personally feel that its not safe to have a child whos 12 or 13 have a blog and i wouldnt want my kids to do that
4199002 i got a call from someone very very close to jen over the weekend asking if i knew anyone who might want to go out on a date with her
4199003 they werent being very discreet about it the news hadnt even broken yet that she and john split youd think of all people jen aniston wouldnt need to use people in her camp as a dating service
4199004 appreciates the nads efforts in this matter and continues to be a firm supporter of the nad self regulatory process
4199005 what he did in boston was criminal now he goes there and everythings ok no sir it doesnt change the fact that how he got there was criminal
4199006 what he did in boston isnt our problem he didnt blow up our franchise so who cares
4199007 youre setting a precedent that will lead to failure and expensive failure
4199008 i dont think the market will be very big and i definitely dont think hell get 25 million a year for four years
4199009 how could you go more than two years on a guy like that i think hell get the red sox deal two years at 20 million a year
4199010 i dont think therell be a feeding frenzy for manny ramirez
4199011 i think hell get a lot of money i just dont think hell get a real long term deal i think somebody might gamble on giving him two years at 18 20 million a year but i cant see anybody going longer than that
4199012 i think hell find some team that will give him what he wants
4199013 and if he cant i think hell stay out there til he gets it
4199014 i bet he gets 15 20 million a year for three or four years especially if he keeps his nose clean and helps the dodgers win it
4199015 hell it wouldnt surprise me if dodgers owner frank mccourt would do that he loves all those boston guys
4199016 ill tell you that i might cost my team a chance to go to the world series but we work too hard to put a team together to take on a guy like that as soon as you open the vaults for him youll wind up with the same problems boston had
4199017 not that id have been interested in the first place hes going to turn it on to get a contract but once you give him that contract hes going to turn it off and then all youve got is a headache every other week
4199018 and hell probably get fired a year later for doing something stupid i dont think manny should get more than a one year deal the rest of his career and anybody who gives him more deserves what they get
4199019 if theyre looking for some justification for going after him now theyve got a way to justify it
4199020 the thing theyre scared about is disrupting what they have in the clubhouse
4199021 and really thats the only way he doesnt fit in there but i dont blame them their chemistry is the best thing they have going for themselves right now theres really something magical going on with that club
4199022 there were a million left handed relievers out there and hes as good as any of them
4199023 his only problem in chicago was getting in lous doghouse and when you get in that doghouse you dont get out its a very deep doghouse its kind of a saint bernard doghouse
4199024 there are no stars in there but they need that depth of talent
4199025 at least they decided they couldnt keep doing the same thing theyve been doing and took some chances
4199026 if they got three major league pitchers in that deal and i think they did then great for them and all three guys ross ohlendorf and daniel mccutcheon are either ready or close so thats a good deal not a bad deal
4199027 if he stays healthy hes definitely the best talent in that group
4199028 theres a guy who if you offer him arbitration theres too good a chance hes going to take you up on it
4199029 hes a better player than people give him credit for
4199030 people think hes just some lazy guy who cant do anything but hit the ball out of the park hes better than that hes a force you have to make pitches on him if you dont hell go long on you or hell walk
4199031 hes a top two rotation guy no doubt in my mind maybe not this year but not real far down the road if hes not already
4199032 i have never wanted to win more than i do right here and i will
4199033 but this is wayne krivskys team not walt jockettys and not mine i just hope there is enough out there after the season that we can get to help us
4199034 his stuff is now a grade below what it was hes become a two seam sinkerball pitcher wheres the front door hammer curveball wheres that four seam fastball he used to bang guys away with im not seeing it im seeing a lot of contact and the hitters look way too comfortable
4199035 hes still good but hes not the liriano we saw before the surgery his stuff is probably 3 to 4 miles per hour less than what it used to be the changeup is pretty much the same speed but the slider and the fastball are not the same dont get me wrong hes still good but hes not that wow he was before hes not as electric hes not as intimidating but hes still a good useful no 3 4 starter type and thats not a bad thing
4199036 when the steinbrenners own your team you cant ever say theres no chance of anything
4199037 i told randy it was a moving pick but if he had his feet set it would have been a block and he would have got the call

4199060 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine would you
4199061 we dont know what to do so were just having fun amongst ourselves
4199062 some of our own people want us to become like the infidels like the jews and christians allah condemn them they want us to renounce our godly religious beliefs and follow in their footsteps by changing our educational curriculum that is based on the koran and the teachings of the prophet peace be upon him a parrot is one who repeats the demands of the enemies of islam that we should stop teaching the koran so that we abandon our faith
4199063 america and the rest of the infidel world should go to hell we are not going to change our education system which is based on the best religion of the world we are proud of being muslims and having an islamic education system
4199064 one of my clients wanted to buy a domain and redirect it to his main site
4199065 we have serious negotiations we are under a commitment to not reveal anything to the media
4199066 just as the establishment of israel in 1948 as the jewish homeland solved forever the jewish refugee problem the establishment of a palestinian state living in peace with israel will be the homeland for all palestinians and will simultaneously solve the palestinian refugee problem
4199067 palestinian refugees will return to palestine and not to israel
4199068 an international mechanism would be established to determine monetary compensation
4199069 the american stance on this is similar to israels as demonstrated in an april 2004 letter by u s president george w bush in which he said that there will be no return to the state of israel only to a palestinian state
4199070 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4199071 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4199072 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4199073 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4199074 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4199075 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama

4199081 the governor has made it very clear that as long as we can serve the public we need to do what we can to exercise flexibility with the employees
4199082 right now i cant tell you how its going to work
4199083 its great for the people who are getting three day weekends and i am real excited for them but its happening at our expense and thats not fair
4199084 you cant make up the soccer game that i missed on monday because you were working and didnt get home until 7 oclock at night or sitting down to do homework with the boys you cant make that up
4199085 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
4199086 many texans support the death penalty but i do not believe that any reasonable person in texas believes that a person like jeff wood should be executed who did not kill or intend to kill woods sentence should be commuted just as kenneth fosters was commuted
4199087 mr wood undeniably shares responsibility for what happened to mr keeran and should be held accountable for his reckless acts but no man ever deserves to die for another mans acts
4199088 under contract law the remedy is monetary damages which arent likely to amount to anything involving open source software that is given away
4199089 can be awarded for copyright infringement without requiring proof of monetary damages people can recover attorney fees for copyright infringement cases and most importantly for licenses such as the gnu general public license it means that your rights to use the copyrighted work at all disappear
4199090 we consider here the ability of a copyright holder to dedicate certain work to free public use and yet enforce an open source copyright license to control the future distribution and modification of that work public licenses often referred to as open source licenses are used by artists authors educators software developers and scientists who wish to create collaborative projects and to dedicate certain works to the public several types of public licenses have been designed to provide creators of copyrighted materials a means to protect and control their copyrights creative commons one of the amici curiae provides free copyright licenses to allow parties to dedicate their works to the public or to license certain uses of their works while keeping some rights reserved
4199091 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace that few could have imagined just a few decades ago for example the massachusetts institute of technology mit uses a creative commons public license for an opencourseware project that licenses all 1800 mit courses other public licenses support the gnu linux operating system the perl programming language the apache web server programs the firefox web browser and a collaborative web based encyclopedia called wikipedia creative commons notes that by some estimates there are close to 100 000 000 works licensed under various creative commons licenses the wikimedia foundation another of the amici curiae estimates that the wikipedia website has more than 75 000 active contributors working on some 9 000 000 articles in more than 250 languages
4199092 open source software projects invite computer programmers from around the world to view software code and make changes and improvements to it
4199093 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however there are substantial benefits including economic benefits to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge similarly a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder the eleventh circuit has recognized the economic motives inherent in public licenses even where profit is not immediate program creator derived value from the distribution under a public license because he was able to improve his software based on suggestions sent by end users it is logical that as the software improved more end users used his software thereby increasing the programmers recognition in his profession and the likelihood that the software would be improved even further
4199094 the conditions set forth in the artistic license are vital to enable the copyright holder to retain the ability to benefit from the work of downstream users by requiring that users who modify or distribute the copyrighted material retain the reference to the original source files downstream users are directed to jacobsen s website thus downstream users know about the collaborative effort to improve and expand the sourceforge project once they learn of the upstream project from a downstream distribution and they may join in that effort
4199095 the clear language of the artistic license creates conditions to protect the economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license these conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package the attribution and modification transparency requirements directly serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform downstream users of the project which is a significant economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce through this controlled spread of information the copyright holder gains creative collaborators to the open source project by requiring that changes made by downstream users be visible to the copyright holder and others the copyright holder learns about the uses for his software and gains others knowledge that can be used to advance future software releases
4199096 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
4199097 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
4199098 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
4199099 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4199100 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
4199101 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
4199102 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
4199103 look what we want to have happen is for senator obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know its as old as you know as greek drama you know there is a catharsis
4199104 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
4199105 obamas roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4199106 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4199107 with so many features and enhancements in lightwave v9 5 users suggested that we could release it as v10 customer feedback has been positive

4199112 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4199113 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4199114 concerning the permanent presence of patriots missiles that will be able to effectively protect our territory
4199115 we need to change we wont lose anything because we have no life in here
4199116 it is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second hand either verbally or in writing revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication after this it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him and though he may find himself obliged to believe it it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner for it was not a revelation made to me and i have only his word for it that it was made to him
4199117 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4199118 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4199201 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4199202 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4199203 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves

4199217 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
4199218 these patients had been through experimental treatments so it is not like we got anybody who had standard of care left dr weichselbaum said

4199222 dereck kamwesa coordinator of ethnic and international recruitment has done an outstanding job with international student recruitment this year taylors name is spreading there are a lot of students coming in who heard about taylor through a family friend or acquaintance in the mission field
4199223 we have also heard from multiple sources that the reputation of the orientation itself is drawing students
4199224 those who visit taylor during high school and hear about the orientation get pretty excited about it and weve heard of plenty of people who have recommended taylor to others because of the strong mu kappa iss presence and the orientations effect on their own children and acquaintances
4199225 there are a lot of practical challenges food getting drivers license getting a ride to the bmv transportation to and from airport coming to school there can be academic struggles quite a few grew up with essay rather than multiple choice questions on tests
4199226 culturally the way americans tell jokes the way we relate to each other can be a struggle for some not having parents or family members around if something were to happen
4199227 solomon carl and judy have been really great about being accessible for students who come in
4199228 i dont know of any other school that does anything like this
4199229 some of these students who are arriving from an international flight on sunday dont get here until just in time for classes
4199230 some are at a cultural disadvantage the term i like to use is hidden immigrants
4199231 their passport says they are americans but they dont feel like americans there is a lot more insecurity
4199232 as a result of the orientation program they are a lot more prepared for interacting with their peers our students are a lot more integrated in their residence halls than they used to be
4199233 its the clip of that verse i in them and you in me jesus prayer for believers the theme talks about what it means to be plugged in spiritually but also be plugged in to life at taylor

4199245 it is obviously tricky because you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back
4199246 inside me i think i would not have a problem going
4199247 in sri lanka last year there were bombs going off while we were there
4199248 but you did not feel threatened by it because you have got the security detail and the army give you escorts

4199250 id be happy to go to pakistan thats for sure
4199251 for the most part people like using a public adjuster because they like the idea that someone is working on their behalf versus someone working on behalf of the company
4199252 if theyre good it really makes a lot of sense
4199253 some public adjusters to justify their fee will exaggerate their claim
4199254 some company adjusters are instantly suspicious or even antagonistic whenever they have to deal with a public adjuster
4199255 is the company out there within 12 hours or has it been a week since the fire and no ones come
4199256 most good companies are going to come out there pretty quick
4199257 youre hiring their knowledge and expertise it looks good on paper but its easy to get ripped off
4199258 the ugly truth is that exaggerated claims can cross the line to fraud and the fact that you have a public adjuster doing it doesnt absolve you
4199259 why was it necessary to hire a public adjuster in the first place
4199260 i know that i am going to get in trouble for what i am saying
4199261 i know that there will be repercussions i will be dragged into some little office somewhere in the next couple of weeks to find out what i mean by all these statements
4199262 but i am just telling the truth i believe that dominic cork is a quality performer yes hes 37 but theres life in the old dog yet
4199263 hes a quality performer i wish him all the best
4199264 i would have liked to have been consulted i am the captain of the team
4199265 i have got to walk out with these players and if they are not in the best frame of mind i have got to deal with it
4199266 at the moment i dont see anybody else who can do that but i am willing to be proved wrong
4199267 ive chosen not to turn up to committee meetings because im not really bothered how hot my tea is or where my car is parked
4199268 its a shame its come to this weve got five games of hard nosed cricket to play and you want your team firing on all cylinders
4199269 what ive just said may affect my decision to stay on i may not have a decision ive just told the truth

4199273 were seeing all of the programs that have worked in the past coming back
4199274 what this speaks to is a lot of customers are upside down in their current cars
4199275 theres definitely more attention to cars that are more efficient
4199276 in general most luxury brands are not as impacted by the decline in demand as most mass market vehicles
4199277 i would be hard pressed to say that a buyer couldnt find an acceptable smaller car at a good price
4199278 when they trade down they dont necessarily want to get into a car
4199279 automakers have learned how to get the most out of their incentives
4199280 most vehicles have some sort of incentive unless theres high demand
4199281 it may be easier to get financing from the dealers
4199282 yeah its true it is and i read the script its fantastic but im shooting at the very same time i wont be able to do it im doing a movie with judd apatow at the same time so thats not going to happen but i did read it it is awesome
4199283 i know quentin for a long time weve been talking about doing it for years for like five six seven years yeah its definitely disappointing id love to do it but i just cant

4199296 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4199297 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4199298 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4199299 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems

4199310 and in some cases when a man dies he can leave all of his possessions including his wives to whomever he wants
4199311 its the way they were brought up they dont know any other way
4199312 look how young they all are how come they all got married to an old guy like that
4199313 in their religion they believe the older you are the closer you are to god

4199327 so then brothers and sisters stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us either by word of mouth or by our letter
4199328 our strong catholic faith teaches us the importance of treating all of gods children with love and respect it also teaches us that marriage between a man and a woman is the foundation of the family the first school of love peace and justice

4199404 whoever youre playing for its always disappointed to get beaten like that when you know you should have done better because you walk off the field thinking we mucked up today and it should have been a lot tighter than that
4199405 were probably more used to that sort of pitch than those guys are it was a little damp in the morning but even so we should have been a little bit smarter with bat and ball
4199406 we lost a poor toss and the conditions were fairly tough early on and it was a slow pitch but we let ourselves down
4199407 we should probably have got up to around 220 or 230 and we were probably not quite on it early on with the ball as well
4199408 dale steyn is a fantastic bowler and asked some good questions early on and we didnt do that enough and then herschelle gibbs showed us how to play a one day innings

4199411 theres no feeling of revenge but its a big coincidence that were playing the same team and of course theres special motivation in this game

4199462 there was something magical about the american sideshow something that made the people want to spend a dime for the chance to see something out of the ordinary when a dime was worth something this work is pure fluxist it lies not within the physical manifestation of the sideshow itself but rather the experience that the viewer takes away with them and the story they tell others of what theyve seen professor josefs cabinet of curiosities is a chance for people to experience something that will soon disappear from existence

4199466 i felt we had a great practice today an extension of what we had yesterday we got a chance to evaluate a lot of our people we got a chance to evaluate them under different conditions and we are very pleased
4199467 usually the second day is always that way it was the same way last year ive probably practiced with a different team seven or eight times since ive been in the national football league and it never changes that second day is usually a bit more competitive and we had some great work
4199468 zach is a great football player i think we all know zach thomas he practices at a certain level and thats why he plays at a certain level every time he hits that football field hes an experienced pro a guy i have always admired and he had a good practice today
4199469 i think both of those guys marshall and cowboys cb adam jones are just having fun there is a lot of respect level there by both guys just going out and competing brandon has a hard time staying quiet though after someone takes a shot at him i do know that
4199470 it wasnt a fight thats was just a little pushing that happens all the time but they kept their composure and they didnt swing thats what you want tempers are going to flare up a little bit thats the nature of this profession but they were professional enough to back off and players laugh at it and smile thats part of practicing against another team but there were no swings and thats what i appreciated two teams acted in a professional manner and hopefully we will have another good practice this afternoon
4199471 they get a chance to see what we are doing and we get a chance to see what they are doing there isnt a gameplan involved but you still want to go out and do a good job you still want to evaluate players as well if we were playing them in a regular season game obviously we wouldnt be practicing against them but thats not they key at this time of year its to try to find your best 53 man squad and also put your system in against other people i think we have had a productive day and a half
4199472 i cant tell you if hes going to play on saturday but its not serious
4199473 i think its a lot different romo was in a backup role i believe for four years if im not mistaken hes a student of the game when you run the scout team or if you are on a team as a quarterback and you have four years looking at different defenses its a little easier to go behind that center and read defenses jay is a little bit different he wasnt thrown in the fire right away in the first year it was a growing experience but there are a little bit more growing pains the quicker you get in romo is reading coverages unbelievably i admire how quickly he reads coverages and gets the ball to the right spot he is going to have a heck of a year you could see it out here today and yesterday
4199474 i see a difference just watching romo play last year he plays with a lot of confidence he knows where the ball is going and if something breaks down he has the ability to make a play on his own he can throw the ball at all different angles and he is a heck of a weapon
4199475 as a team we had a little drop off but you know thats part of playing in the national football league we just got to be more consistent
4199476 basically i said yesterday that 21 is no champ bailey i thought about it for a moment today that since hes changed his name back to adam hes not even pac man hes not even as good as pac man used to be but its all in fun i explained to him that he needed to spice it up because im winning right now
4199477 im aiming for perfection and today i had a little drop off i had a few dropped balls and thats not like me i was kind of upset with myself im always trying to have a pro bowl day every day and today is not one of those days
4199478 yesterday was a little buddy buddy system going on but today was more intense and more physical we got after it today and it was pretty even
4199479 well when you see peyton manning come out and he sees different coverages whether its press or off coverage he changes it up as a defensive back in the nfl you make your money doing press coverage so i said lets go deep we went deep we went 100 percent going deep against pac man jones i mean adam sorry and we won
4199480 its exciting to be able to go against someone else and to be able to go out and compete against another team you got to motivate yourself a little more when you wake up every day going against the same guy today felt like game day a little bit
4199481 definitely when you are going against other guys guys that you are not friends with sometimes tempers flare
4199482 i really cant say what happened i guess two guys got into it a little extra at the end of the play once that happens your friends come and their friends come and pile on just grabbing pushing and tugging away
4199483 i guess yesterday people were feeling each other out we felt that we had the upper hand early in the morning yesterday and we knew they were going to come out with a higher intensity level and they did that we all came out and practiced hard today
4199484 definitely we do that with our own team sometimes when we go against our own team the defense will win and the offense will come out extra motivated because the coaches in the meetings are yelling at you and things like that it makes us want to come out and give that extra effort the next practice
4199485 its kind of hard to tell i am not a db so i am not staring at the quarterback most of the time most of the time i am on man coverage on somebody so i really cant tell you
4199486 he is a very strong runner his speed is a little bit deceptive he is a lot faster than people give him credit for he runs well inside the tackles and outside

4199499 only on insurers not on employers who self insure or on the new york state insurance fund both of which are responsible for paying the same types of benefits the new obligation violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it does not serve any legitimate public purpose and because there is no rational basis for discriminating against insurers the principal effect of the amendments is to confer a significant cost advantage on the nysif the state0owned insurer that is the largest in the state and the principal competitor of plaintiffs and other private carriers the amendments thus serve only the parochial competitive interests of the nysif not any public purpose

4199506 when maggie told us that she lost her father and had to go back to south africa i was devastated devastated for her loss of her father so suddenly i cant imagine the pain of that and i feel terrible that she has to go through that i was also devastated to lose her in the show she played the role of cleopatra so beautifully and brought so much fire and individuality to the part that i knew that losing her would change the effect of the play i of course understood the situation and agreed there was no question about her having to leave and take care of her family she will be missed
4199507 when we lost maggie kristina did not hesitate to save us she has nerves of steel it was a blessing for us to find an actress who implicitly understood the character and was able to walk seamlessly in her shoes i have never met an actress with the ability to enter stage with not even a full day rehearsal with a script in hand and then wink at me when it was over
4199508 i have always loved computers i find them really interesting and stimulating ive been into it since the age of two when my grandfather bought me my first computer and at the moment i am in the process of setting up an online blog for my family i hope to be a web designer when i finish my education when i am not on my pc or my laptop i spend lots of time reading i also enjoy rock music and play the electric guitar

4199527 russias position is unchanged we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia in accordance with the u n charter not only do we support but we will guarantee them
4199528 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4199529 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia and all commands from outside are illegitimate to us

4199566 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
4199567 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration

4199681 data from numerous studies unequivocally indicate that air pollution is directly linked to the adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the general population
4199682 and effects are seen at levels at or below existing air quality standards
4199683 recent epidemiologic studies show that increased levels of air pollutants are positively associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
4199684 inhalation of air pollutants affects heart rate heart rate variability blood pressure vascular tone blood coagulability and the progression of atherosclerosis
4199685 major mechanisms of inhalation mediated cardiovascular toxicity include activation of pro inflammatory pathways and generation of reactive oxygen species although most studies focus on the influence of systemic effects recent studies indicate that ultrafine particles may be translocated into the circulation and directly transported to the vasculature and heart where they can induce cardiac arrhythmias and decrease cardiac contractility and coronary flow
4199686 the general consensus is that once deposited in the lungs air pollutants trigger an inflammation related cascade
4199687 will possibly identify specific causal agents that can be better regulated and increase the effectiveness of our efforts to reduce the risk of developing air pollution related health problems
4199688 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels

4199723 using a number of other methods of calculation including 14 available in off the shelf software programs the libert study would have been a failure by the common standards of statistical significance in research
4199724 long been criticized by statisticians for exaggerating the certainty of research results
4199725 but since this was right on the border greater scrutiny reveals that the true the real p value was slightly more than 5
4199726 we used standard methodology that we discussed with the fda up front and then executed
4199727 we have no obligation to show that we can meet any arbitrary test
4199728 were not going to say theres anything mistaken in your mathematical calculations but the issue is really the relevance of that analytical thread
4199729 the atlas trial met its primary end point and it did so using the statistical method approved by the fda
4199730 the fda has reviewed the trial results and the analysis and has validated both while this may be an interesting statistical debate it has no bearing on the performance of the taxus libert drug eluting stent
4199731 failing to rule out the possibility that patients getting the libert stent will have markedly more artery recloggings than those receiving the express
4199732 although the difference seems small 0 2 of a percentage point it is the difference between success and failure for a product on which boston scientific has spent some tens of millions of dollars
4199733 worship at the altar of two trials demonstrating a p
4199734 the 0 05 threshold is arbitrary nothing magical about it
4199735 making binary decisions yes or no based on whether the p value threshold is met is rather superficial for example a p 0 048 will meet the criterion but a p 0 052 wont the difference between the two scenarios is 4 percentage points in probability this line of thought process exposes the tyranny of p values
4199736 is there any real gotcha here who cares if the atlas trial meets statistical significance with the wald only its commonly used and every other p value in the
4199737 bottom line both clinically and mathematically there is no difference whatever in meaning between a p value of 0 04999 and 0 0500000 its totally arbitrary and arguing about it is like arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin im perfectly happy as a scientist and clinician accepting as significant and likely correct a p value of 0 06 or 0 07 as one of 0 04
4199738 how interesting it is to see a journalist at the wsj serve as the watchdog fda like function
4199739 i do think there is a role for the lay press to verify the accuracy of medical research because for one they have a large readership that comprises the patients in whom the technology or drugs will be used and two they have the resources to serve a watchdog role until there is full transparency of the process at the regulatory level
4199740 however there are some major caveats the lay press has to employ independent qualified personnel to review the data similar to what the wsj did like statisticians and clinicians with clinical trial experience i dont think its appropriate to have journalists without this type of background review complex trial designs half the time even those of us in the profession have trouble understanding the designs
4199741 if something thats very important is being missed by peer review or allegedly by the fda review then i think it was perfectly within the purview of the media to examine this if its carefully done and vetted by other external experts i think this is a very important role for the media to play
4199742 those are the rules of engagement and boston followed them we cant criticize them for that but we can hopefully use stories like these to convince the clinical community that the devices that get approved in this country dont go through a rigorous process like drugs if the fda tells the companies that they have to jump one inch they aint going to jump any higher
4199743 people can approach the fda for guidance and the fda can make certain recommendations but theres no guarantee that the fda can be held to those because its not always the case that the people who agreed to the trial design are the same people who are going to be reviewing the data this has come up many times
4199744 just because a methodology is standard does not necessarily make it right

4199765 hospitalized patients who smoke maybe more likely to quit smoking through the use of hypnotherapy than patients using other smoking cessation methods
4199766 a new study shows that smoking patients who participated in one hypnotherapy session were more likely to be nonsmokers at 6 months compared with patients using nicotine replacement therapy alone or patients who quit cold turkey
4199767 in a recent stop smoking study where smokers attended individual hypnotherapy for stop smoking over three sessions 81 stopped smoking after treatment ended
4199768 of 43 consecutive patients undergoing this treatment protocol 39 reported remaining abstinent at follow up 6ms to 3 years post treatment this represents a 90 6 success rate using hypnosis

4199784 were going to have less airlines one way or another either we will have consolidation at some point or certain airlines will got out of business
4199785 at these high oil prices we cannot support the size of the industry that we have now we have too many airlines with too many seats and too many hubs
4199786 were spending a lot of time rethinking what that model what the industry model looks like and how you make it work at those levels
4199787 the survivors will be the ones that will be the most nimble in adapting the ones that have the most cash reserves and have the best cost structure
4199788 the more competition we have and the more pricing decisions by ceos we have the better for consumers
4199789 its still coming down to the bottom line though can any one of these airlines survive in this era
4199790 the failure of united to find a merger partner is not surprising given the fact that no airline southwest included can survive at 130 per barrel oil
4199791 either prices must rise by 50 a ticket or massive layoffs and cutbacks are needed
4199792 after much work and many conversations with other airlines we have come to the conclusion that consolidation involving us airways will not occur at this time
4199793 with fuel prices like this its going to get much worse for flyers it has to get much worse or airlines are going to continue to lose billions of dollars
4199794 people have started to cut back they are not finding the great discounts on airlines anymore
4199795 this environment demands that we act and the industry act decisively and responsibly
4199796 killing ted is a good move because it doesnt have a place in the market
4199797 the bigger question is is it enough to stop the losses which at united are great
4199798 no one was well served by what happened last week
4199799 we want to make very clear there is no place no place at all in this agency for anyone who is interested in turning a blind eye to the safety of our skies
4199800 probably the worst development in the history of aviation since deregulation
4199801 in my experience there are going to be some losers and those are employees and consumers
4199802 how are they going to cut costs based on my past experience without significant disruptions
4199803 the fact that they can dominate more of the market that will give them more pricing power
4199804 the risks of a merger at this time outweigh the potential rewards
4199805 difficult but necessary step to reduce the number of people we have to run our business
4199806 its disappointing any time any of our pilots are furloughed
4199807 fuel prices are not totally to blame the companys business plan or lack thereof contributed to this decision
4199808 the only hopes that airlines have is to cut capacity and cut planes and if you cut planes you cut pilots
4199809 the reality is there will be fewer flights on some routes and layoffs in some cities where there is significant overlap between the carriers
4199810 i would expect some cuts at the smaller hubs and mid size cities
4199811 this may be good news for the top executives of both airlines but i believe its bad news for consumers and airline employees
4199812 the proposal offered yesterday by delta and northwest to merge will probably be the worst development in the history of aviation since the aftermath of deregulation
4199813 with fewer airlines getting antsy about fare increases the greater the likelihood of it going through
4199814 you dont try to follow the rules you follow them this isnt golf or horseshoes
4199815 i could have been at work today i feel like im in limbo im not traveling and im not at work it was just a wasted day
4199816 generally airline mergers are not good for airline employees or consumers
4199817 when airlines merge it means there are fewer airlines less competition and higher prices they cause me grave concern
4199818 i dont think any of the airline problems are going to be solved by airlines getting bigger
4199819 im a free market guy but i have mixed emotions about mergers
4199820 some benefits may come from consolidation but i worry the loss of competition would be a negative for consumers
4199821 it just seems to be business as usual with flight delays
4199822 the worst thing for passengers with any of these solutions is to exchange delayed flights for higher fares and fewer flights
4199823 we need to come up with solutions that either provide better ways to handle demand or divert that demand to other facilities
4199824 promotes a pattern of excessive leniency at the expense of effective oversight and appropriate enforcement
4199825 was evidence that faa management personnel with the responsibility and the authority to take appropriate action proved themselves unworthy of being custodians of the public trust
4199826 most egregious lapse of safety i have seen in the last 23 years
4199827 the faa would have us believe that what took place was an isolated incident
4199828 but this was a systematic breakdown of the safety oversight role of the faa
4199829 we need a change of attitude at the highest levels of the faa
4199830 a cozy relationship between the faa and airlines and a lack of an enforcement mind set
4199831 we need a change of attitude at the highest levels of the faa
4199832 this is an important part of our efforts to achieve operational reliability
4199833 a step in the right direction toward addressing important issues affecting our pilot group
4199834 it also serves as an excellent example of the success our airline can achieve when management and employees work together
4199835 we are working feverishly to inspect clear and re insert aircrafts into service
4199836 we expect to get a majority back in service by this evening
4199837 luckily we had some great weather and our spares were put into regular scheduled service
4199838 its going to be like what we went through for nine hours it will feel like it was for us imprisonment
4199839 kate hannis regrettable experience and her advocacy have helped keep washington focused on this issue

4199846 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered
4199847 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
4199848 the normal practice if someone has died in a four bedded ward is to access a single room where the deceased could be viewed by the family and the family can have some time with the relative and for that to be done in as dignified manner as possible
4199849 this case highlights the campaign were running and highlights the kind of problems nurses come across because no nurse would want a deceased patient lying on a ward for seven hours
4199850 the faa is an agency thats spiraling downward and approaching the losing of the confidence of the american people
4199851 we are working very hard to get this right and to review our processes in the future so we dont have a repeat
4199852 if capitalists had been present at kitty hawk when the wright brothers plane first took off they should have shot it down
4199853 im working on this plane in this hangar and when i finish i wont go to the next hangar
4199854 accepted pay cuts in 2003 and we have asked them to keep changing to drive more productivity and they are answering the call
4199855 i could run american airlines with 1 000 fewer pilots
4199856 no matter how strong your brand or how good your product
4199857 i hope the companies that do that will have consequences
4199858 our results dont look that different than uniteds which was three years in bankruptcy
4199859 i have an 800 number now that i call if i get the urge to buy an airline stock i call at 2 in the morning and i say my name is warren and im an aeroholic and then they talk me down
4199860 we have lots of options at our disposal including court actions and other things and we will continue using every one of them
4199861 we believe that any such action would be illegal and that a judges decision in recent weeks to block a strike by northwest airlines flight attendants further strengthens our position
4199862 we are prepared to continue to negotiate and we gave them a proposal today
4199863 does not have the luxury of returning to the bargaining table
4199864 my perception is that after that happened friday they didnt get what they wanted they had nowhere else to go
4199865 our proposal would have provided substantially more value to deltas unsecured creditors than the delta stand alone plan
4199866 we would have created a better and more financially stable airline that offered more choice to consumers and increased job security
4199867 this is a proud day for the thousands of delta people customers communities civic leaders and others who stood up for our stand alone plan our focus now is on the work still before us to emerge from chapter 11 this spring as a strong healthy and vibrant global competitor
4199868 the us airways proposal had more money but there were a lot of problems too
4199869 creditors saw deltas plan as having less risk deltas management created enough doubt to be able to emerge free for now
4199870 i dont know what else he thinks we can do
4199871 we are disappointed but were not going to let it defeat us
4199872 allows our customers to continue to book northwest airlines with confidence knowing that we will get them to their destinations reliably
4199873 committed to negotiating a consensual agreement with our flight attendants
4199874 every reasonable effort to settle disputes without resort to strikes
4199875 in light of northwests prospects for reorganization and the impact on the traveling public the hardships tip decidedly in favor of northwest
4199876 us airways is the worst of all potential merger partners
4199877 we will not be distracted by emotional or irrational arguments there is simply too much at stake to lose sight of what is really important
4199878 the 787 is the talk of the town aviation wise
4199879 its about having the right airplane at the right time with the right capabilities
4199880 not only did it obviously put to rest those rumors a few years ago that boeing was going to go out of the commercial airplane business this sledge hammers that to death
4199881 in a world that in many ways has created these rock star ceos you dont see companies with rock star ceos doing that well
4199882 boeing is eating airbuss lunch certainly this year and theyll do it again next year and for the foreseeable future unless airbus can pull a rabbit out of a hat
4199883 the track record of good mergers is hard to find
4199884 whenever you go from having two carriers to one or three carriers to two that is going to have a consumer impact
4199885 there will be a loss of service in some smaller communities there will be an increase in fares there is no question that there are antitrust issues that wont be quickly or easily resolved
4199886 i think the track record of good mergers is hard to find
4199887 there are more chances of this deal being killed because of market forces and the justice department
4199888 it was well received and the process continues the process is gaining steam
4199889 they have their cards to play and they are going to play them
4199890 this was totally unexpected unsolicited unencouraged and unhoped for we are so dissimilar we have different equipment we have different service philosophies
4199891 if this devolves into three systems which is the weakest of the three systems
4199892 its not as though we believe we deserve a pay raise we understand concessions have to be made but this is too much
4199893 the benefit of this job was you were a full time employee and your time away from home was balanced by time off so that life didnt cease to exist
4199894 if im away four to five extra days a month i dont see my family and my garden is dead
4199895 the days of airlines being fun and lucrative thats over
4199896 a lot of us were just getting to the point where it would all pay off and all of a sudden were back to where we were
4199897 when i started out in 1966 i signed an agreement to voluntarily leave at 32 we could not be married
4199898 as time went on we were able to eliminate discrimination and we bargained to make this a career so we had a reasonable expectation of providing for a family this is not about concessions or no concessions but whether it remains possible to put food on the table and educate your children
4199899 this is bigger than any one union or work group or company
4199900 because we compete with the low cost carriers in price its essential for us also to compete with them in cost
4199901 whether its a long term life choice is a decision the employees have to make
4199902 whats being proposed there is not even living wages for anyone
4199903 there is most certainly going to be a strike if that contract is imposed
4199904 no one is under any illusion how deep these concessions were
4199905 if they make this money and dont give some of it back theres going to be trouble in 2009
4199906 going to have a little more pricing power than there was in the past
4199907 going into the future we will see more crowded planes having empty planes is a luxury we no longer have
4199908 it can take not just hours but in some cases days to accommodate passengers
4199909 its still going to be a very competitive world well see fare battles well see snooze you lose fares
4199910 its still a slugfest and thats good for the consumer
4199911 you would rather have a service where everybody is happy but the flight attendants there are still professional i dont think theyre going to go out and be rude to anybody
4199912 i want to give you a big hug and thank you for saving my job
4199913 while continued losses clearly are unacceptable deltas financial performance for the quarter was in line with expectations especially in light of fast rising fuel prices
4199914 as concerned passengers and shippers booked flights on other airlines
4199915 to some of them its as basic as whether or not they can continue to work here i think for a lot of them they had nothing to lose by rejecting it
4199916 we already have the problem of prices rising and employment growth slowing
4199917 it would certainly not help to have an event that slows down transportation
4199918 there could clearly be some economic impact with the transport and tourism sectors a particular concern but it is far too early to know what the effect will be
4199919 investors understand that the threat is always there and its very encouraging to see that the plot was foiled
4199920 in my opinion thats going to be the main thing
4199921 us airways is the worst of all potential merger partners
4199922 a strike or work action by afa flight attendants would be illegal under the railway labor act
4199923 wanted to remove any doubt as to which proposal offered more money to the creditors
4199924 the risk of our plan against the risk of a stand alone plan
4199925 while it is likely that a us airways delta merger could take longer to close than delta emerging from bankruptcy one cannot ignore the magnitude of the cash component
4199926 delta is in bankruptcy and bankruptcy is a very open process
4199927 the process is designed so that the creditors get the highest possible value for their clients given that process what we have done is gone public with an alternative to a standalone plan
4199928 deltas plan has always been to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007 as a strong standalone carrier
4199929 if the pilots plan terminates the federal pension insurance program will sustain a multibillion dollar loss as a consequence
4199930 follow on retirement plans and other payments or distributions to pilots
4199931 it is unfortunate that this threat to our careers and our airline now comes from some of our own former pilots
4199932 so as to treat fairly and equitably all creditors and affected parties
4199933 it was just a temporary decision it is not a win for the company
4199934 were quite confident that when the decision is made it will uphold the northwest flight attendants right to strike
4199935 were by the phone and waiting for northwest to call
4199936 our group is disappointed but they know its only a temporary setback the battle is not over
4199937 we remain committed to negotiating a consensual agreement with our flight attendants and hope to accomplish that goal in the near future
4199938 the stakes are very high for all concerned and those are the kinds of circumstances that tend to cause parties to return to the table at some point
4199939 im going to be really pale when i get there
4199940 well see how things develop over the next couple of days
4199941 theyre going to have dramatically different economics post bankruptcy which is the good news
4199942 the bad news is theyve beaten down labor so much that theyve got morale problems
4199943 northwest may have shed 4 billion in debt but theyre still an over leveraged airline
4199944 we felt that sticking to the knitting and doing things that they do really well
4199945 northwest has been good to us in that one regard
4199946 in every other regard weve been having things taken away and taken away and taken away
4199947 were both considering new careers and looking for new jobs
4199948 one of us has to leave we just have decided we both cant stay its not within our budget to both be here were worth more than what were being paid
4199949 for many these prospects in the restructuring are bittersweet because as exciting as they are they have been made possible only at significant cost
4199950 we must honor these sacrifices through a careful and caring stewardship of our airline and its future
4199951 i can see that the next economic downturn may not be as severe as sept 11 but its going to put a lot of pressure on them again
4199952 i think the big lesson everyone should learn from this is that the industry has not fundamentally changed
4199953 we remain hopeful that our discussions in the coming days will be productive but we also have to plan for the possibility that we will not reach an agreement
4199954 it seems that the company would rather litigate than negotiate
4199955 a lot of them who would rather stay at comair will be forced to seek other jobs that have competitive wages some job security and retirement
4199956 is the most popular olympian also one of the oldest
4199957 we had a very bad weather year last year and thats one of the reasons 2006 hit a record number of delays
4199958 there is not much room for margin of error in the system now
4199959 we are hitting the wall in terms of the system we have today being able to handle the volume
