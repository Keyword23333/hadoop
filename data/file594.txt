5940019 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5940020 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5940021 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5940022 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5940023 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5940024 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5940025 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5940026 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5940027 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5940028 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5940029 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5940030 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5940031 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5940032 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5940033 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5940034 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5940035 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter

5940037 it was unfortunate laporta had to go down because of things that went on earlier
5940038 if the ball wasnt cut off it would have been a bang bang play and nobody would have said anything
5940039 we do not teach that in china or in the united states
5940040 it was a low blow to throw at his head
5940041 i think it was brutal to throw at his head you can hit guys in other places thats part of the game
5940042 thats baseball but you never hit the guy in the chest thats an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him thats where the game got out of hand
5940043 the last one laportas beaning really bothered me i hope the fans dont get the wrong impression of the game
5940044 in many ways carers become prisoners in their own homes
5940045 its not uncommon to come across parents whose child was 50 and had never spent a day away in all their lives
5940046 nothings changed in the health of our sons yet we still have to fill in the same forms
5940047 its a sadness that our sons are disabled and then its an anger that weve got fill them in again and again
5940048 there needs to be more recognition of the value these carers have
5940049 for carers not to be truly understood and valued is an issue the government takes a long hard look at
5940050 families must be encouraged and supported rather than ignored considered troublesome or deliberately excluded
5940051 agencies that arent paying competitive wage increases are losing staff to agencies which are near the top of the pay pile
5940052 that has a compound effect on the cost for the losing agency
5940053 so if youre on the bottom of the pay pile because you dont have funding sufficient to meet wage increases and youre churning staff your resources are continually being dragged into paying your advertising and recruitment costs
5940054 it just puts you further and further behind the eight ball
5940055 i guarantee that if you put a group of centrelink workers into an office perhaps here in canberra for a day or two they could come up with pages and pages of ways that greater efficiencies could be made which didnt have the deleterious effects that we believe the current funding arrangements have
5940056 the shit that happened to my children im going to get each and everyone of youse f ers back
5940057 my children are having nightmares and each and every person is going to suffer the same shit
5940058 if i see you come near my house again im going to f ing shoot you
5940059 im not going to be taken lightly you know who this is
5940060 the cover tenders were requested from the fire brigades its a bodgy price to make up the numbers
5940061 so youre telling me the fire brigade is telling you to create as you put it in your words bodgy tenders
5940062 yes thats what my understanding of what a cover price is
5940063 well win it the right way and thats by winning it
5940064 standing behind a lectern in michigan this week with two trusted senators ready to do his bidding john mccain seemed to forget for a moment that he was only running for president
5940065 i dont think the u s is to blame for whats happening in georgia
5940066 burns is a person who as undersecretary of state until recently was part of forming the u s policy toward georgia
5940067 we must not be part of the redrawing of lines in europe
5940068 we should not allow this current situation to draw new lines in europe and prevent a democratically elected government to join nato if they want
5940069 we were right to support the right of independence for kosovo
5940070 the u s tried very hard and assertively to support kosovos independence but not make it a precedent
5940071 what the administration doesnt understand is that whats a precedent is in the eyes of the beholder
5940072 we dont get to decide how other people react to what we do
5940073 that means that the leaders of the abkhaz and south ossetians are not on the same legal grounds as the democratically elected leaders of georgia of the leader of russia
5940074 if you asked the people in those two regions where they want to live in terms of independence or under the georgian state its quite clear that the leadership is representative of that
5940075 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army
5940076 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
5940077 it would be best if the arrest or killing of any hvt high value target were announced on 26 27 or 28 july
5940078 if we dont find these guys by the election they are going to stick the whole nuclear mess up our a hole
5940079 would like to end it with minimal damage to aipac
5940080 fighting with the fbi to limit the investigation to steve rosen and keith weissman and to avoid expanding it
5940081 ishaq for the jews and elias for the christians we muslims are part of that jewish and christian religions and both names are mentioned in the quran
5940082 i want to make sure that my children grow up in syria with names that keep reminding them of our diverse nation watan this is syria and not saudi arabia
5940083 you need to strengthen yourselves economically and militarily so that you possess the adequate capability to confront dangers and threats to your country
5940084 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbit it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
5940085 frankly alex i dont see how indias quest for independence relates to the arab israeli conflict or the war on terrorism
5940086 israel is a fact now and we are acting with this fact our border is the lebanese border
5940087 frankly alex i dont see how indias quest for independence relates to the arab israeli conflict or the war on terrorism
5940088 you claim to be against the exclusivism of the israeli jews but if you really believe in its wrongness then you have to also question the exclusiveness of any similar definition of
5940089 we were secretly married in december 2000 and nobody knows our anniversary everyone knows its december but the actual date is hidden its our anniversary and nobody elses were just trying to maintain some form of privacy
5940090 atop her 12 cm stiletto heels she moves with the grace of a ballerina
5940091 paris is worthy of more than just shopping there is so much to see and to do so many places to visit fashion is not of supreme importance to me like all syrian women i like to be elegant but i always prefer attire that is quiet refined and relaxed at home in damascus i also wear locally made clothes and jewelry i feel very comfortable in them
5940092 i tell them the two of you are very cosmopolitan you have excellent english
5940093 she represents everything that a good sunni family can be
5940094 many syrians tell me theyre tired of syrias current image theyre tired of seeing the jordanians and the moroccans and feeling like theyve been left behind they want style they have a passion for the good life for pleasure and she symbolizes openness and fun people admired hafez assad but he wasnt a fun person he hardly ever smiled and when he did it was a sly fox kind of smile his son bashar is young he has a sense of humor he likes to water ski to drive cars you have no idea how many syrians ask me when asmas going to come to the u s already when were going to get to see her on the morning programs
5940095 the official residence of the president next to the peoples palace has never been lived in
5940096 it is huge with many salons and you would never have any idea who was in the house with you from day one my parents in law have lived in central damascus we live in this street and we have neighbors with kids playing there and the president plays there sometimes with the kids in the street the only difference between this street and any other street is the barriers its an everyday syrian street and syrian building when i wake up in the morning i hear the birds singing the kids playing and the traffic in the other place you hear nothing its not normal no birds no children no cars
5940097 i wouldnt mind going back there for certain things but it would not be a priority for diving yes but not for a lot of other things
5940098 i do not have a nanny for my children we were not brought up like that and we dont want our children brought up like that when i have meetings their grandmother lives next door and they go with her it is important for the family to play a role when i have office work i bring my children with me
5940099 we were all brought up with a sense that one day you will come home i have three younger brothers and we all speak arabic we all understand the culture the religion the tradition it is not new or alien to us because we were brought up with a sense that one day we will come home
5940100 despite her classic british accent when she speaks english i didnt see heads turn when she spoke arabic in public
5940101 syrians view her cosmopolitanism as an advantage and not a disadvantage
5940102 it is something that joins my husband and me we are both technology oriented
5940103 i cant say that i was ever really an emma
5940104 i was born in london and lived there for 25 years
5940105 but i always knew i was syrian i speak fluent arabic and can read and write in the language im british and arab at the same time and no part of me is diametrically opposed to any other part i am in both worlds simultaneously
5940106 i didnt know him as a young boy because there is a 10 year difference but he was always somebody who was there there was very little interaction maybe hello good bye i was 10 and he was 20 and i was playing with my barbies and he was out doing something it was scary
5940107 it was very gradual it was not traditional because he is not from that nor am i and his family isnt either each one of them actually is against the norm it was a very gradual natural process
5940108 he always tries to see the best in any situation to him everything can be solved you can find solutions to everything and that to me is somebody who is completely open and completely willing to see everything to me this is one of his strongest points
5940109 he has a very keen sense of research in the sense of wanting to explore all the possibilities and this is something that guides him throughout his political decisions an example is the camera i am not sure you know but he is a keen photographer very very keen so anytime a new camera comes on the market he will explore the differences between this camera and the one he had not in the sense of perfectionism but in the sense of liking to know what is happening and keeping track of things this is a small example but if you are that keen on photography it shows up in a lot of things
5940110 its not a question of asking or giving it is a question of having an open dialogue always between us from the small things to the larger things and because he is a conversationalist and because he likes to know different opinions and he likes to benefit from everything around him
5940111 in the way she finishes a story that bashar starts and it pleases him in the way they care for their children i think theyre a very good team
5940112 but i think that if i were to speak with her father today hed be proud of her and of her activity
5940113 it was the correct decision and it came at the right time together my husband and i make a solid team as a couple of course but also on the professional level were involved together in the profound change that is occurring in our country its a wonderful privilege and a great honor to invest yourself in the development and growth of syria alongside your husband
5940114 there were a lot of questions about why some people thought that she will no longer be seen she has disappeared she lives in a big house and we will never see her again some people thought that traditionally here first ladies have not played an active role and maybe she does not want to play one nobody knew the reason was that we both my husband and i thought that i needed to meet the people and understand them first
5940115 i was able to spend the first couple of months wandering around meeting other syrian people it was my crash course
5940116 because people had no idea who i was i was able to see people completely honestly i was able to see what their problems were on the ground what people are complaining about what the issues are what peoples hopes and aspirations are and seeing it firsthand means you are not seeing it through someone elses eyes it wasnt to spy on them it was really just to see who they are what they are doing
5940117 why do i drive my own car i like to drive it
5940118 because you see the peoples faces and you interact with them directly why do i go to the supermarket to buy groceries yes there is someone to do it for me but why do i do it one because i enjoy it and two because im seeing other women other children other people and im getting a sense of prices and a sense of what people are buying and that is something that reports or advisers cannot give you because everybody has their own perception
5940119 i admire how fashionable she is and i also think that the face she presents internationally is important to many syrians to show that there is a class of women in syria who are not covered with the hijab or the veil
5940120 that there is someone there who is not a product of the israeli arab conflict and who proposes different positions asma brings to the government the need to integrate in the world economy and in order to do this she cannot remain isolated
5940121 the more we invest in the cities the more migration there is to them investment such as a new tunnel in damascus that cost 300 million syrian pounds how much of that could have been used in rural development if i put 100 000 pounds in a village it will have a much bigger impact
5940122 the system does not allow you to stray from the target or to lose focus here in syria if someone takes a day off people ask where is he whats his phone number hold on lets ask in administration and they have a number that was last updated 20 years ago
5940123 were helping a weaving company get into the market but after that theyre on their own theres competition and that will be the judge of whether theyre good enough
5940124 he wants modernization but he doesnt want a situation in which the government can fire him the businessman wants development but for the market to continue being closed because he reaps a benefit from this
5940125 everyone looks at development from his own angle instead of looking at the development of the state
5940126 and we must ensure that there are other opportunities we need to find the correct balance between creating opportunities and risk management this is the key to what syria is becoming today its a process of change that were undergoing
5940127 she goes along with this whether she wants to or not i asked her some very tough questions but she stood behind her husband and behind the administrations policies
5940128 i think that people need to see the man behind the presidency they need to see what his values are his ethics his personal traits then theyll be able to better understand who he his and what hes trying to do
5940129 why are you criticizing corruption you should not forget that bashar is a great leader who defeated bush
5940130 a most critical juncture in the history of the nations
5940131 i think you are saying that syrians do not have an adequate sense of their social contract with the rest of the citizenry and that this is a contributor to corruption if that is what you are saying
5940132 1982 for the sake of fighting terrorism and maintaing peace in the region
5940133 renewal of tria is critical as a private insurance market will never develop some experts goes on to saying that catastrophic terrorism risk is uninsurable by the private market because its true dimensions are incalculable whether you live in london madrid or new york
5940134 unmark as dynamic data wizard preview 0806 for vs 2008 sp1 rtm is now available

5940136 i love oasis but it was crazy to hear that
5940137 my dad used to sing live forever to me as a kid so its a real honour
5940138 sitting down with my teammates we agreed that if we really commit ourselves over the next four years were going to be in position to win silver or gold in 2012
5940139 i hope the rest of the world knows that we compete with passion were talented and were only going to get better
5940140 i dont have any regrets about anything ive done at the olympic games i have to use the same word ive been using all month its surreal to be here and know that i didnt miss a routine the whole time
5940141 he does these skills in the gym to have fun
5940142 if i fall im not going to medal if i stay on im going to medal so it was worth it
5940143 no practice is really important but maybe its better to be lucky than good
5940144 he continues to surprise us beyond our wildest dreams he knew he was going to have to step it up and he did he thrives on this you give him the hairiest stuff to do and he wont be conservative
5940145 in terms of the kinds of routines and the kind of person i am that will stay the same
5940146 what im doing right now is working i do risky gymnastics and in todays sport thats what you have to do
5940147 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5940148 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5940149 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5940150 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline

5940162 je rencontrerai le dala lama comme je lai toujours indiqu je lavais d j confirm le 13 ao t dernier depuis ce rendez vous a t fix avec le bureau de repr sentation du dala lama au matin du 22
5940163 je consid re ma rencontre avec le dala lama comme un triple t moignage venu du fond du coeur je lui dirai mon respect pour le chef spirituel quil est mon admiration pour lhomme de paix quil est et ma solidarit pour le combat courageux quil m ne depuis tant dann es

5940168 if barack obama could pick someone who he would most like to work with governor sebelius has a very good chance
5940169 weve been on this path for the last few years
5940170 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
5940171 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
5940172 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
5940173 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
5940174 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
5940175 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
5940176 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
5940177 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
5940178 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
5940179 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk

5940224 presented in narutos original broadcast ratio of 4 3 the episodes in this set all look great naruto is a very bright colourful anime which is handled well by a transfer that exhibits bold vibrant colours that are free from noise and any bleeding likewise brightness and contrast levels are never less than impressive while detail levels are as high as you can expect from a show that first aired in 2002 look a little closer at the image though and you can spot the occasional recurring video artefact things like cross colouration in some of the line work dot crawl in some of the finer areas very faint edge enhancement and some very fine mosquito noise theres also the usual ntsc pal interlacing foibles as well but the negatives should be almost unnoticeable on an average home cinema display
5940225 ok firstly we have the dd2 0 soundtrack the format that naruto was originally recorded in its an excellent track dialogue is loud clear and whenever any high screaming kicks in its dealt with crisply with no audible tear likewise the sound effects and thumping bass provide a rich and involving companion to the dialogue

5940238 he was magnificent as good as ive seen him in three or four years he was up to 95 mph he commanded both sides of the plate he had slider command away to right handed hitters and that bugs bunny curveball
5940239 everyone says hes a dog but he played well for me
5940240 he ran every ball out played well defensively he can flat hit but if the power is there its going to be late coming
5940241 hes letting more of his personality come through being more vocal taking charge more

5940248 while it has become a longstanding tradition for the israeli delegation to visit the memorial to the victims in tel aviv on the eve of their departure for the olympics the tradition to hold a formal memorial ceremony during the games only began at sydney in 2000
5940249 the memorial is arranged by the israeli olympic committee in conjunction with the local israeli embassy but has never been incorporated as an official program under the international olympic committee for which the israelis have been pushing
5940250 part of their preparation is to learn and be aware of the heritage of our 11 slain athletes
5940251 all the athletes know and meet the families and on the way to the games they visit the memorial to the munich victims in tel aviv it is a part of their education
5940252 to continue to train and to continue to participate in the olympic games just as we are doing here in beijing
5940253 probably they are concerned about the reaction of those who will disagree with a memorial like this
5940254 there are 205 nocs national olympic committees participating in the olympics and there are more than a few dozen that will strongly disagree with this kind of event
5940255 this is not an israeli issue this concerns the whole olympic family
5940256 our sons fathers and husbands were no accidental tourists or visitors to the games they were part of it they believed in the spirit and the dreams of the olympics but they all came home in a coffin
5940257 and i kept repeating to myself are these the olympics they dreamt about
5940258 the overall mood of the night was that the ioc should recognize the 11 athletes who were murdered in 1972 as olympic victims
5940259 schpitzer said official recognition of the munich massacre has been her cause since 72 and promised that her children and grandchildren would continue to fight for official remembrance by the international olympic committee

5940269 reserved seats for minorities have not increased since the creation of pakistan and musharrafs rule was no exception
5940270 musharraf introduced the joint electorate system for minorities after knuckling under international pressure
5940271 whoever becomes next president he is likely to remain indifferent toward pakistani christians
5940272 he had thrown his lot with the u s president george w bush in the wake of 9 11 terrorist attacks in usa
5940273 musharrafs role in war on terror did not improve minorities situation
5940274 he had lost popularity with masses there was a general opinion in the country that he should go
5940275 every pakistani irrespective of his faith should be entitled to run in the presidential elections this issue is not religious but that of equality for all
5940276 the political parties leadership has become mature over the years i hope they can agree on a consensus candidate
5940277 it is in the spirit of democracy that the next president comes from the ppp

5940333 there is nothing to suggest that ahmeds will was critically affected by the agents various appeals to his muslim beliefs and there is nothing inherently coercive about such tactics

5940392 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5940393 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5940394 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002

5940408 thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5940409 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting

5940522 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
5940523 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced
5940524 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
5940525 there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
5940526 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the re election of members of congress

5940538 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5940539 sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems and are especially vulnerable to overfishing and yet currently there are few effective controls on fishing or trade
5940540 theres no doubt that sharks are a very important part of our marine ecosystems while theyre not necessarily popular they are a important part of the food chain and we need to make sure that their populations are maintained

5940553 there is certainly a need to improve access to mainstream sexual health services for aboriginal people
5940554 continuing access to effective sexual health service delivery is an essential part of reducing sexually transmissible infections among aboriginal people
5940555 this workshop is an opportunity for workers from mainstream organisations to carefully reflect on how their services are organised and delivered and how they can work better with aboriginal people
5940556 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000

5940594 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking with an object
5940595 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
5940596 striking a child with an object is unacceptable and may be dangerous
5940597 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5940598 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema

5940602 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5940603 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5940604 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5940605 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5940606 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5940607 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5940608 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5940609 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him

5940618 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5940619 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5940620 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5940621 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5940622 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5940623 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5940624 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5940625 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5940626 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5940627 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5940628 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5940629 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5940630 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5940631 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5940632 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5940633 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5940634 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5940635 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5940636 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5940637 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5940638 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5940639 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5940640 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5940641 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5940642 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5940643 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5940644 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5940645 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5940646 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled

5940664 private equity really is almost tailor made to solve the difficulties currently faced by financial institutions in a way that will cause less friction down the road
5940665 a number of investments by private equity will tend not to be majority investments which make can them even more politically palatable
5940666 private equity is a very good source of capital there are the issues relating to effective control what constitutes control we are looking at that and we will make a clear statement about that
5940667 private equity has become popular to demagogue unfairly but i dont believe that politicians are succumbing to that temptation
5940668 private equity is really about standing between the taxpayer and these losses for a finite period then returning the stake to the public markets once the problems are addressed

5940709 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5940710 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5940711 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5940712 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5940713 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5940714 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5940715 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5940716 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5940723 children as big pharma guinea pigs 98 percent of drug trials on children have no safety checks
5940724 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
5940725 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
5940726 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
5940727 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part
5940728 we need to test drugs on children as the only other options are to use unlicensed drugs or prescribe drugs that have been licensed for adults
5940729 but we feel that the small number of studies that reported having safety monitoring committees was unacceptable

5940736 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5940737 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

5940762 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5940766 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5940772 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

5940896 ive never had a quarterback thats gone an entire spring practice running and throwing the ball without turning the ball over and he was really getting hit tomey said
5940897 what he did was extraordinary he had the best spring anybody has ever had for us
5940898 quirky but he is a good runner and his combination of poise and efficiency is exactly what tomey demands of his quarterback
5940899 with coach tomey the guy who plays the best is most efficient and takes care of the ball is going to play quarterbacks coach marcus arroyo said
5940900 myles doesnt turn it over and he makes good decisions thats going to put you in position to win some ballgames

5940910 marijuana is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man
5940911 in my era everybody smoked and everybody drank and there was no drug use

5940914 how can i take water into my boiler while i am letting off steam
5940915 he thinks he is dying but what is death to madness let him die a thousand deaths were more easily borne than the pangs i suffer
5940916 he gives us the flexibility to do a lot of different things
5940917 we have a lot of backs so were not going to have one guy take 500 reps in a game were going to spread the wealth but well definitely find ways to get him the ball
5940918 he has a gift god blesses everybody with some kind of ability but everything he does is effortless
5940919 estamos en la parte final de la revisi n de los supuestos de revisi n de c mo vendr a el presupuesto de egresos y les podr a decir que una de las prioridades que estamos considerando es el tema de seguridad
5940920 he gives us the flexibility to do a lot of different things
5940921 we have a lot of backs so were not going to have one guy take 500 reps in a game were going to spread the wealth but well definitely find ways to get him the ball
5940922 he has a gift god blesses everybody with some kind of ability but everything he does is effortless
5940923 i think maybe a new league seeing new guys and they havent seen me that much
5940924 the more i see them i have to make adjustments and the more they see me theyll be making adjustments but i definitely think it makes a difference
5940925 we just got to watch him keep him fresh and keep him strong
5940926 this kid is a competitor he pitches with confidence and hes done a real nice job here obviously
5940927 one thing about our pitching staff for a good while now theyve given us the chance to win games on a continual basis
5940928 the thing about him is hell throw 88 mph 89 90 and then when he gets to two strikes he can pump it up to 94 or 96
5940929 thats as well as hes thrown the ball since early in the year
5940930 i was looking behind my shoulder and he was freezing thats why i went to first it was a tough play
5940931 i just followed the third baseman down the line and i was pretty far down and whenever he let go of the ball i thought it was going to be a cruise
5940932 but im not that fast so i just got to go headfirst into home plate luckily i scored
5940933 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5940934 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5940935 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5940936 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5940937 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
5940938 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5940939 i think id like to reach 15 wins every year if possible
5940940 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
5940941 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes
5940942 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5940943 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5940944 i was just trying to go up there and throw strikes they take a lot of pitches maybe thats why theyre so good
5940945 we had some opportunities and matsuzaka made some big pitches and got out of them
5940946 but we hung in there the best we could when your teams playing good everything seems to go your way and when its not going your way it seems like guys out in the field got extra gloves on
5940947 we had the right guys up there and it didnt happen
5940948 now that you said it i think someones going to get that hit
5940949 it doesnt matter whether the bases are loaded or not my job is to not allow the runners to score if theres a base empty of course its a little easier but its not something i worry about
5940950 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
5940951 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
5940952 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
5940953 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
5940954 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5940955 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5940956 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
5940957 today was a pretty good day i really pushed it i gave it my all to see what i could do
5940958 i hate to look so far down the road because this is a tricky situation
5940959 its one of those things where it feels really good one day and you come back another day and its sore
5940960 its one of those injuries where you have to really monitor and make sure im not overdoing it

5940985 the indian search market is dominated by global internet brands with google attracting the wide majority of searches
5940986 as the top local player in the search market indian web portal rediff com attracts slightly less than 2 percent of all searches indicating that there is substantial room for growth among the local internet brands
5940987 though india represents more than 15 percent of the worlds population it accounts for less than 2 percent of global internet searches
5940988 it will be interesting to see if this gap narrows as more people in india gain internet access and ramp up their use of search over time

5940991 this issue is one thats going to require global participation industry has migrated from regulated to unregulated countries
5940992 cap and trade is a big issue to the mining industry
5940993 this presentation was a chance to get smart and help our members get smart about this issue
5940994 we have maintained for years that healthy forests need to be managed
5940995 its not an end all be all but it gives businesses the flexibility they want in addressing emissions
5940996 greenhouse gas emissions are a global issue and should be addressed at the international or national level members said
5940997 cap and trade proposals for reducing emissions were viewed with skepticism and concern especially due to the increasing cost of energy
5940998 the cost of environmental harm falls not on business and industry but on people
5940999 my biggest concern is that this cap and trade is going to becoming a money generating mechanism for government
5941000 cap and trade is a policy approach for controlling large amounts of emissions from a group of sources the approach first sets an overall cap or maximum amount of emissions per compliance period for all sources under the program the cap is chosen to achieve a desired environmental effect authorizations to emit in the form of emission allowances are then allocated to affected sources and the total number of allowances cannot exceed the cap individual control requirements are not specified for sources instead sources report all emissions and then surrender the equivalent number of allowances at the end of the compliance period allowance trading enables sources to design their own compliance strategy based on their individual circumstances while still achieving the overall emissions reductions required by the cap
5941001 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5941002 listen to this this one has pineapple coconut milk chicken curry
5941003 when they did that in california they had an 11 million litre tank that they partially drained every two hours
5941004 they had 30 people working around the clock and they force fed the whale with a massive tube not only do we not have the facilities to do that in nsw but the success rate of that method is only 2 to 3 per cent and it has never been tried on a humpback whale
5941005 it is likely only to distress or endanger the whale and to endanger those trying to carry out the feeding process

5941026 due to the impressive performance of the british olympic team we expect there will be a significant increase in requests for olympic related sites over the next six days and we predict that this will take its toll on companies bandwidth
5941027 if companies do not have sufficient bandwidth then a number of problems can occur including business interruption and a slowdown in performance to critical business lan applications as well as serious cost implications
5941028 whilst companies may want to give employees the freedom to look at these sites they should address the problems that may occur due to a sharp increase in the viewing of streaming media
5941029 employees that are not taking part in this olympic web surfing may find that their access to legitimate business sites is delayed due to the pressure on the companys bandwidth importantly this could have an impact on the companys bottom line

5941033 our existing performance review systems were very generic and didnt focus enough on the individual
5941034 we realised they were not progressive enough and we wanted an effective way to show our employees that we were investing in their career development while implementing a high performance culture as part of our overall people strategy to attract train and retain staff we needed the ability to collaborate across the group we also wanted to be more proactive and strategic about managing our training in particular we wanted the ability to identify skills gaps and high performers within the business
5941035 we did a benchmark of suppliers and were very quickly impressed with the level of service insight and expertise from successfactors
5941036 we were particularly impressed with successfactors leadership status and industry expertise in the hotel sector and their track record at helping organisations implement a high performance culture because successfactors is delivered online we can create a dynamic system that directly links to our development and training systems that highlights training skills requirements rather than just a once a year paper based process we will also be able to collaborate across the group enabling senior management to share ideas work together more closely and transparently cascade our group objectives down through the business to provide an overall snapshot of the organisation

5941058 ce ne sont pas des d linquants la prison nest pas la bonne solution pour des enfants de 13 ans
5941059 the only way that major brands grow is by being successful globally and china is in many ways the next frontier
5941060 a rapidly expanding immigrant and expat community that has remained psychologically very linked to the homeland
5941061 a population base that no global marketer can afford to not cater to
5941062 whatever is important to you in life well help you achieve it so go ahead dream on well help you get there
5941063 our olympic activation is focused on the 10 countries and territories in asia in which we have operations
5941064 has said publicly for some time now that we will be focusing our sponsorship dollars elsewhere once our sponsorship comes to an end at the end of this year
5941065 im grunde hat die ikb das schon bisher getan nur hat die bank in diesem klassischen kerngesch ftsfeld einfach nicht genug verdient sonst h tte man sich kaum auf das abenteuer mit minderwertigen us hypothekenkrediten einlassen m ssen
5941066 der verantwortete als dresdner bank vorstand schon einmal ein hnliches gesch ftsmodell fiel 2002 damit aber der finanzmarktkrise selbst zum opfer
5941067 ich w rde annehmen dass die ikb im zuge der krise viele ihrer besten mitarbeiter schon verloren hat f r den leiter personal geht es heute vermutlich darum mitarbeiter zum bleiben zu bewegen und neue kr fte zu finden
5941068 ich h tte mir eine d sseldorfer dreier l sung aus
5941069 so hat er die jungs kennengelernt und auch in seiner freizeit etwas mit ihnen unternommen er ist mit ihnen ins schwimmbad oder in die kletterhalle gefahren
5941070 die meisten taten passierten bei bernachtungen im pfarrheim jugendherbergen oder beim zelten
5941071 it was a fantastic start and this meet will give our kids a ton of confidence
5941072 ive had five bypasses and i have diabetes but what the heck you either sit down and die or you keep on moving i love football theres nothing like coming back to the school you started and seeing how far its come
5941073 hes out walking in the woods and fishing and says heck i can coach football when do you want me tomorrow he came the next day he winterized his cabin put the jet ski in the dock and was ready to go he got here monday
5941074 dick started bartlett and he gave us all our chance coach meaney and i both served under dick at elgin and he gave us both our first sophomore jobs we owe a lot to him for building the program to where its at for making the playoffs eight straight years
5941075 hes probably one of the toughest men i know he had an open heart surgery with five valves fixed and was on the sideline within four weeks that was amazing that old school toughness every football team needs it
5941076 eerrr were you at his kl concert ye was not t

5941079 i was nervous because i had the ticket but am still in shock
5941080 wed like to congratulate the lake family for being the winning seat holder through our daily herald grand slam inning
5941081 its still a reminder on his paychecks of what he did and his employers are going to know why he has garnishments
5941082 between constant bouts of pneumonia and infections he gets hes got to be monitored 24 hours a day
5941083 he can be fine one day and wake up the next with something wrong
5941084 we wanted his matts life altered like he altered kyles
5941085 healing the shattered soul restoring hope to those impacted by trauma
5941086 what happened to her did not have anything to do with my brothers death and no one who was there got to come in and testify against her
5941087 we do not for a moment discount the tragedy that was alonzo de la torres death
5941088 unfortunately under the circumstances of this situation this was the most serious charge we could have filed and we obtained the maximum sentence
5941089 if someone had done a rush on that we may have wound up going in the wrong direction
5941090 i want to see it broadened and also identify things we need at st james to make it accessible for everyone
5941091 most of these groups plan their events a year in advance
5941092 if were going to have special events we need to get the word out that were available
5941093 there are enough people who have a special interest in seeing st james flourish that we dont need to go into the districts coffers
5941094 i was very hesitant about getting back into local politics
5941095 theres plenty of time and campaigning really hasnt started yet
5941096 as a couple both share teach and volunteer their time to motivate by example
5941097 im not surprised the wittkamps won the community leadership award because theyve been consistent and persistent torchbearers for physical fitness not only appealing to the younger generation but to the 50 plus
5941098 it was during the second world war when womens softball became popular
5941099 my dad took me to try out for a semiprofessional team but then he thought i was too young to travel so i declined
5941100 in the late 40s and mid 50s it was not considered feminine
5941101 we visited senior groups to find out what activities they enjoy and then reported back to the park district
5941102 then we tried to implement the programs with some help
5941103 passion for bringing seniors together for a new beginning socially and informing seniors about healthy activities
5941104 lollie walks the walk and talks the talk she began exercising at the age of 5 and is still igniting static electricity in the lives of many encouraging them to get fit
5941105 some friends came to me and said lollie youre going to run and i did and i love it
5941106 one thing near and dear to me is i would like to have a 50 and over coed soccer league
5941107 its on paper now so its just a matter of coordinating it with other park district programs
5941108 i think well take the gold in the 75 and over
5941109 when they would tar the roads wed ask them to put some down to mark our bases
5941110 i think i received it from a culmination of a lifetime of physical activity
5941111 all the while i was enjoying it i didnt realize i was becoming a role model
5941112 i was hoping hed get a hit in the last inning so i could start with ichiro suzuki
5941113 they gave us a script of highlights and we could read or ad lib
5941114 but no amount of practice can prepare you for this
5941115 its in honor of sean and everything he represented everything he did
5941116 friends and family can sum up sean in one word heart a kind caring and passionate young man sean gave it all on the field and gave of himself to help others at every turn
5941117 the colors are wonderful and the field just looks terrific
5941118 we got some finishing touches but we are going to get it cleaned up in time for the first game
5941119 they really do help make that stadium a better facility
5941120 we have some nice things planned to really play this up
5941121 she was in what i call a tripod position with her head down and she started crying
5941122 after about 15 30 seconds she looked up and said i hurt that child
5941123 if you compare the written statement its about 99 percent word for word of your notes correct
5941124 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5941125 every night at least one person tells me how beautiful my yard is
5941126 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5941127 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5941128 were trying to accommodate those families who request to attend our schools but are nonresidents
5941129 we have been declining in students so we have the space to accommodate additional students
5941130 i dont want to open our district up to people who are having problems and will be a problem for our teachers and students
5941131 so is this going to have a major influx of students in our district
5941132 its certainly a small accommodation that we could possibly make for those few families who have requested to come in the district but dont reside here
5941133 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5941134 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5941135 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5941136 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5941137 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5941138 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5941139 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5941140 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5941141 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5941142 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5941143 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5941144 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5941145 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5941146 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5941147 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5941148 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5941149 we may end up discussing what we want to do about blocking mailboxes and looking at the fine structures if this thing continues to go on to the degree that it has
5941150 i would like to think it is over with but when we bring the mother lode out there this week
5941151 it was the only instance in my roman catholic life that ive considered suicide
5941152 we saw the flashing lights and all the people the cop cars and the paddy wagon
5941153 i wanted to stay clear of it to get away as fast as i can
5941154 theyd fired tear gas because the crowd was throwing things like rocks and bags of feces
5941155 suddenly this great cloud of gas rolled over the car
5941156 i saw cars pulled over to the side there was one cadillac with an elderly couple getting rid of their evening meal
5941157 that was the spooky part seeing people you know getting pushed around
5941158 i never met a policeman who went out of the way to harm someone
5941159 from my perspective if the crowd had listened to orders and obeyed the law there would have been no confrontation the crowd was not an orderly crowd
5941160 it was a matter of male ego in my opinion
5941161 if daley had not elected to clear out the parks at 11 p m you wouldnt have had a street fight at the convention
5941162 i told him senator i just came here to be appointed not ordained
5941163 they voted me the only guy they trusted over 30
5941164 the war being fought now doesnt have a draft associated with it
5941165 its the draft that made all the difference these people had friends in vietnam
5941166 it was a close to a nervous breakdown those kids were distraught
5941167 the people at the rally felt very strongly about what the war was doing to the people of vietnam but also to the people of this country
5941168 the police formed a v wedge through the middle of the crowd no one had any idea they were coming through they were just listening to the speakers
5941169 i think i was shocked the city and state would go to such extremes to stop what was for the most part a peaceful organization
5941170 at the end of the day i felt very demoralized
5941171 and felt change was much further off than i expected i think there were more tears in my eyes because of what i saw than what the mace caused
5941172 there are several issues both that the elgin families who filed the lawsuit have and we have here
5941173 we have complained for 20 plus years about our kids being bused all over the district about crowded classrooms and certainly we have had our share of mobile units our issues kind of parallel theirs
5941174 we would say that these things are happening because of the districts size
5941175 and to that point had the district been smaller and less bureaucratic many of those issues would not have arisen
5941176 its a districtwide issue the size of enrollment and the physical size of the district its almost impossible to meet everyones needs
5941177 theyve got a program its working well but its a large district and they feel that they have to treat everyone the same as a consequence where good programs arent the same you have to get rid of them the point is one size cant always fit all
5941178 it would be hard to imagine a scenario where bartlett disconnecting would not impact the rights of the 17 000 or more class members
5941179 the court at some level would have to review any attempt by bartlett or any other community to try to disconnect at this point
5941180 there is still a lot of work to do and this is the next step in getting the roads to someplace thats more of a maintenance role
5941181 this is the next step in getting the streets up to world class condition
5941182 it will be a challenge for the audit and finance commission and this board to pay down the bond
5941183 its only by gods grace that the victim wasnt killed
5941184 im not saying i shouldnt be punished for my actions
5941185 cook county has been the worst experience of my life
5941186 i thought i was invincible in two years ive seen im not
5941187 i think the sentence was way too much considering the victim did not pick him out of a lineup
5941188 its unfortunate were talking about both these issues the same night
5941189 but we have to pass the pay ordinance 180 days before the election
5941190 i spend about a fifth of my week on village business
5941191 its time consuming im not recommending the position be full time but someday that may have to change
5941192 its just a matter of taking advantage of the low interest rates now and doing more of the roadwork earlier than later
5941193 the goal would be to make sure all our streets are maintained on a more regular basis
5941194 weve got five years from the time the referendum is approved to issue all of the bonds
5941195 you can piecemeal it based on prudent fiscal planning so you dont have to borrow all of it
5941196 if you borrow it later you risk the interest rate escalating
5941197 a lot of times people say that they dont have a voice in their government
5941198 this is a time when they get to choose how the village moves forward
5941199 what were trying to do here is fix things that have never been fixed
5941200 i think that just shows that this village even despite the fact that were in a horrible economy weve still got a very good community to offer and were very excited that the businesses are still willing to make the investment in our community
5941201 we have been looking for ways to get involved in pingree grove and to let the residents know that we want to bring events to their growing community
5941202 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5941203 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5941204 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5941205 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5941206 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5941207 randhurst reminds me of that new car you loved when it was new but as it aged and you had to put more money into it no matter how much you loved it there came a time to replace it
5941208 i am honored and humbled by my appointment and will work hard to justify the supreme courts faith in me
5941209 while i recognize the significance of my elevation and my heritage i want ultimately to be remembered as a good judge for all the people
5941210 he has worked hard is very conscientious and will do a great job representing the hispanic community and all of lake county
5941211 were just calling it our flexible corn boil because everything changes daily
5941212 im a bit uncomfortable that perhaps theyre biting off more than they can chew
5941213 we obviously dont want to get ourselves into a situation where we are way over our heads
5941214 its the same thing for teachers too its a sea of children youve never seen before
5941215 every year what i do in my room it is from scratch
5941216 you need a lot of color and a lot up on the walls
5941217 we have everything else but we needed to bring a white sock and a ruler sized pencil box
5941218 we make sure that we carry the things from the local schools
5941219 were ready for the crunch when they cant find it anywhere else theyll be here at 9 p m
5941220 the seventh parliament of zimbabwe will be sworn in on monday or tuesday next week
5941221 mientras las tropas rusas sigan ocupando pr cticamente georgia no veo la forma en que podr amos convocar el consejo otan rusia
5941222 sin embargo no cortaremos todas las posibilidades de comunicaci n con rusia
5941223 exigimos a mosc que muestre en palabras y en hechos que se siente obligado por todos los principios sobre los que construimos nuestra cooperaci n
5941224 fue desmedida e incompatible con el papel de las tropas de paz as como incompatibles con los principios de la cooperaci n conjunta entre la otan y rusia
5941225 depender de qu pasos emprenda rusia para cumplir con su promesa de retirada
5941226 no dice ni una palabra sobre c mo comenz esto por qu ocurri qui n comenz la agresi n y qui n arm a georgia
5941227 trata de convertir a la v ctima en agresor de lavar la cara a un r gimen criminal

5941231 i dont think it was that ragey but its all a matter of perspective i guess
5941232 the mayors taskforce on opportunities for minorities and women is charged with identifying root causes as opposed to symptoms and recommending solutions that will increase the competitive participation in city contracting of companies that are reflective of our diverse community
5941233 we want to get something in the ground as soon as possible
5941234 my concern is i dont see any benefit to myself
5941235 he wants the benefits of the community without being in the community
5941236 if the future did a documentary of the last fifty years this is how badly the reenactors would dress
5941237 in thirty years dial this number youll know what to do after that
5941238 imagine my friend of whom i was thinking fleetingly in the midst of memories at thirty
5941239 how about taking some food from me i cannot finish mine

5941267 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful
5941268 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
5941269 thats sorting itself out theyll all play in this game but thats starting to take shape
5941270 there are some guys we still we want to get a good look at just to make sure
5941271 there might be some guys that we know what they can do and maybe they dont get as many reps
5941272 you cant always say oh hes getting a lot of reps he must be the guy it might be but it might not be
5941273 he was just picking my number i dont think theres anything to read into that it easily could have been devin hester or marty booker
5941274 whoevers making the decision on who the no 1 is or who the no 2 is or who the guy is that gets the most balls is whoever decides that
5941275 i just want to make sure im making plays when my number is called
5941276 it doesnt matter who the quarterback is im going to be where i need to be when im supposed to be there and the quarterback will deliver the ball
5941277 the ideal place for children of different cultures to mix
5941278 it is at least a move towards a form of indirect discrimination in education
5941279 much more affordable for farmers and low income urbanites if compared with regular insurance products
5941280 the pentagon wants to deploy one of its powerful x band radars in israel along with personnel from u s european command to operate the long range early warning system
5941281 once deployed and fully integrated the combined u s and israeli system is expected to double or even triple the range at which israel can detect track and ultimately defend against iranian missiles u s and israeli officials said
5941282 my mom saw that there was a minor league baseball team in town so we kept a close eye on the flyers since they started up in 1999
5941283 i came to a couple games and talked to some front office people bugged them with baseball stories and then applied the following season for an usher position
5941284 this being his first game and being that he hadnt pitched in awhile he did a great job
5941285 he made good pitches at crucial times worked quick and the guys felt comfortable playing behind him
5941286 she always believed in me and wanted me to go as far as i could
5941287 when i got that call from maddock i knew it was her helping me out when i crossed that foul line and made it to the mound i took a glimpse and i knew my mom was there spiritually with me it was unbelievable
5941288 we cant arrange long term care here so we try to do the best we can in the country of origin
5941289 the question is is the hospital acting as an immigration agent in effect by deporting this patient
5941290 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
5941291 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
5941292 there were certain legal procedures that the hospital should have followed that they bypassed
5941293 we have worked with the individual who has had primary decision making responsibility for the patient
5941294 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
5941295 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5941296 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
5941297 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
5941298 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
5941299 we hope the group will not lose more time in evolving an acceptable resolution of all the issues in the larger public interest and peace in the state
5941300 is believably beleaguered though not even as jack bauer did he ever pull a gun on a nun its good to see him stretch
5941301 theres got to be more of an excuse for this than this is all i could line up for my hiatus from 24
5941302 in a film that features scads of broken mirrors the recipients of the proverbial bad luck seem to be those who unwisely bought a ticket
5941303 this is indeed a stunning development which could imperil warner bros entire 2009 movie slate
5941304 the schools were over the moon about getting involved and it was great to see everyone out there at the cenotaph
5941305 following rapid assessments carried out in lanao del sur and lanao del norte we announce this additional response to idps internally displaced persons
5941306 in the current unpredictable security situation vulnerable victims of these clashes urgently need to receive humanitarian assistance especially essential food among other complimentary relief items
5941307 we hope for peace and stability so that affected families in mindanao can soon return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives
5941308 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
5941309 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
5941310 all the crews worked well and thanks to the cobargo narooma and tilba units the fire was stopped from getting to camel rock

5941434 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
5941435 the us germany and india are privately acknowledging that a second or third meeting will likely be convened sometime in september on the issue and that changes to the us august 6 proposed text will be necessary to achieve nsg consensus
5941436 perhaps in recognition of many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting
5941437 the reports cite unnamed india officials as saying they are hesitant to do so that is not surprising since indias participation in the discussion could force its officials to answer some uncomfortable but essential questions about its bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with the us france and russia as well as its interpretation of the india iaea safeguards agreement and other issues
5941438 also with respect to the safeguards agreement approved by the iaea on august 1 does india formally recognise that it may not unilaterally terminate the agreement or withdraw facilities or materials from safeguards even if fuel supplies are interrupted due to new delhi resuming testing or violating its safeguards agreement
5941439 has india initiated formal negotiations with the iaea regarding an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement or not

5941469 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5941470 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5941471 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5941472 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5941473 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5941474 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5941475 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5941476 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5941477 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state

5941481 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5941482 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5941483 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5941484 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5941485 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5941486 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5941487 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5941488 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5941489 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5941490 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5941491 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5941492 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5941493 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there

5941506 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5941507 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5941508 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5941509 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5941510 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5941512 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5941513 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5941514 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5941515 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics

5941520 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5941521 oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or federal revenue
5941522 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5941523 generates about 240 billion in annual revenues and employs a quarter million germans germanys wind industry created 8 000 jobs in 2007 alone and one recent study suggested that the renewable sector could provide more work than the auto industry currently the nations biggest employer by 2020
5941524 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5941525 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5941526 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5941527 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5941528 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5941529 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5941530 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5941531 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5941532 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5941533 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5941534 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5941535 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5941536 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5941537 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5941538 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5941539 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5941540 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5941541 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5941542 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5941543 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5941544 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5941545 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5941546 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5941547 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5941548 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5941549 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5941550 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5941551 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
5941552 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
5941553 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
5941554 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
5941555 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
5941556 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
5941557 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
5941558 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world
5941559 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
5941560 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5941561 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5941562 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
5941563 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5941564 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5941565 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5941566 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5941567 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5941568 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5941569 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5941570 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5941571 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5941572 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5941573 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5941574 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5941575 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5941576 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5941577 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5941578 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5941579 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5941580 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5941581 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5941582 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5941583 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5941584 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5941585 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5941586 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5941587 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5941588 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5941589 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5941590 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5941591 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5941592 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5941593 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5941594 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5941595 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5941596 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5941597 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5941598 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5941599 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5941600 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5941601 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5941602 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5941603 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5941604 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5941605 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5941606 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5941607 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5941608 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5941609 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5941610 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5941611 they told me there are going to be resources here
5941612 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5941613 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5941614 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5941615 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5941616 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5941617 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5941618 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5941619 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5941620 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5941621 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5941622 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5941623 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5941624 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5941625 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5941626 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5941627 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5941628 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5941629 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5941630 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5941631 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5941632 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5941633 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
5941634 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com

5941637 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5941638 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5941639 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5941640 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5941641 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5941642 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5941643 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5941644 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5941645 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5941646 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5941647 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5941648 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5941649 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5941650 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5941651 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5941652 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5941653 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5941654 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5941655 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5941656 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5941657 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5941658 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5941659 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5941660 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5941661 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5941662 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5941663 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5941664 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5941665 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5941666 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5941667 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5941668 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5941669 tell me what it is this isnt about t boone pickens it isnt about democrats and republicans this ones about america
5941670 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5941671 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5941672 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5941673 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5941674 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5941675 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5941676 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5941677 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5941678 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5941679 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5941680 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5941681 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5941682 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5941683 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5941684 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5941685 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5941686 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5941687 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5941688 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
5941689 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
5941690 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
5941691 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
5941692 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
5941693 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
5941694 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
5941695 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5941696 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5941697 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5941698 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5941699 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5941700 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5941701 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5941702 liu xiang ya no compite no nos interesa nos vamos
5941703 la imagen que trajo l grimas a miles de millones de ojos
5941704 esto demostrar al mundo que los asi ticos tambi n podemos correr muy r pido
5941705 la nueva imagen individual de la naci n que se elev por encima de la tradicional colectividad china
5941706 now all i am looking for is superficial temporary escapades with pretty young ladies
5941707 its harder than it was when i was younger i only go after girls who are in their athletic prime but its okay
5941708 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5941709 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5941710 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5941711 if youre going to kill each other do it outside i just finished cleaning
5941712 you better pray that will come out of the carpet
5941713 if you dont straighten up im going to knock you into the middle of next week
5941714 if you fall out of that swing and break your neck youre not going to the store with me
5941715 make sure you wear clean underwear in case youre in an accident
5941716 keep crying and ill give you something to cry about
5941717 it looks as if a tornado swept through your room
5941718 if i yelled because i saw a meteor coming toward you would you listen then
5941719 if ive told you once ive told you a million exaggerate
5941720 i brought you into this world and i can take you out
5941721 there are millions of less fortunate children in this world who dont have wonderful parents like you do
5941722 you are going to get it when we get home
5941723 if you dont stop crossing your eyes they are going to freeze that way
5941724 if you dont pass your spelling test youll never get a good job
5941725 put your sweater on dont you think i know when youre cold
5941726 when that lawn mower cuts off your toes dont come running to me
5941727 if you dont eat your vegetables youll never grow up
5941728 when you get to be my age you will understand
5941729 one day youll have kids and i hope they turn out just like you
5941730 bob saget is gay and he takes it up the ass
5941731 no i had to turn in my sense of humor when they gave me my feminist membership card
5941732 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5941733 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5941734 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5941735 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5941736 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5941737 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5941738 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5941739 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5941740 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5941741 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5941742 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5941743 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5941744 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5941745 get it off the air and i really mean it
5941746 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5941747 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5941748 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5941749 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5941750 i am married to the next president of the united states
5941751 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5941752 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5941753 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5941754 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5941755 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5941756 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5941757 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5941758 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5941759 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5941760 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5941761 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5941762 adapun hukum khitan maka yang tepat menurut kami adalah wajib dan ini merupakan pendapatnya jumhur seperti imam malik ahmad dan pendapat ini yang dipilih oleh ibnu qayyim
5941763 artinya kemudian kami wahyukan kepadamu ikutilah millahnya ibrahim yang hanif
5941764 menurutku kelima perkara yang disebutkan dalam hadits ini semuanya wajib karena seseorang jika ia meninggalkan lima perkara tersebut tidak tampak padanya gambaran bentuk anak adam manusia lalu bagaimana ia digolongkan dari kaum muslimin
5941765 khitan diperselisihkan pada wanita apakah mereka dikhitan secara mutlak atau dibedakan antara penduduk masyriq timur dan maghrib barat

5941774 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5941775 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5941776 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5941777 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
5941778 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
5941779 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5941780 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5941781 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5941782 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5941783 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5941784 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5941785 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
5941786 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
5941787 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
5941788 but there are other factors involved such as vertical wind shear which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere you could also have drier air these are far more critical factors than the ocean being warmer
5941789 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
5941790 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
5941791 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it
5941792 when we performed that night all that i could feel in my heart was joy pure joy
5941793 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5941794 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5941795 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5941796 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5941797 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

5941799 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5941800 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5941801 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5941802 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5941803 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5941804 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5941805 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5941806 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5941807 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5941808 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5941809 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5941810 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5941811 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5941812 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5941813 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5941814 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5941815 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5941816 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5941817 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5941818 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5941819 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5941820 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5941821 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5941822 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5941823 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5941824 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5941825 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5941826 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5941827 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5941828 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5941829 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5941830 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5941831 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5941832 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5941833 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5941834 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5941835 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5941836 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5941837 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5941838 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5941839 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5941840 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5941841 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5941842 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5941845 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
5941846 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
5941847 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5941848 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5941849 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5941850 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5941851 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5941852 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5941853 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5941854 artificial insemination should never been accepted by christians doctors in the first place
5941855 so the moral issue here lies further downstream on the face of it the court decision might force christian doctors to reeducate their consciences by learning what real christian medical practice is
5941856 isnt it time to establish an alternative and moral traditional christian medical practice around the country the fault line is already there but weve got christian doctors standing on both sides of it
5941857 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
5941858 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200
5941859 often ill want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as i can so they stop and i can get some peace

5941867 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5941868 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5941869 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5941870 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5941871 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5941872 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5941873 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5941874 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5941875 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5941876 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5941877 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5941878 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5941879 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

5942032 i felt brazil could harm us and that the boys argentine players would break that barrier at any moment
5942033 since long time ago i didnt see a brazil so skimpy and defensive the sub 23 gave them more skimpiness at the playing time nobody gave the ball to ronaldinho they didnt have team play argentina surpassed them in every meter of the field and the triumph was fair

5942080 napoli ha le qualit per fare bene in europa consigliai maradona a ferlaino ora scommetto su valeri
5942081 buona impressione su tutti gli aspetti soprattutto sul piano tecnico tattico la squadra ha risposto benissimo e lapproccio alla gara stato quello giusto per una squadra che vuole diventare grande in europa e logico che con larrivo di nuovi giocatori alcuni sincronismi si debbano ancora perfezionare soprattutto gli esterni devono calarsi nella mentalit del tecnico che richiede oltre che una spinta costante in fase offensiva anche un sostegno nelle diagonali difensive garantendo alla squadra una giusta copertura quello che non mi piaciuto che i centrocampisti portano troppo palla quando dovrebbero giocare con meno tocchi e appoggiare di pi le punte anche in fase offensiva ci dovrebbe essere una punta che pi dovrebbe tendere a venire incontro la palla e non aspettare i lanci lunghi dalla difesa o la vena creativa del centrocampo ma essere pi propositivi comunque sono cose che con il lavoro e la giusta applicazione si possono certamente migliorare
5942082 per me gi cosi il napoli una buona squadra forse se si volesse fare qualcosina bisognerebbe solo trovare una giusta alternativa a vitale che potrebbe peccare solo in inesperienza perch sul piano tecnico si tratta di un giovane con buone potenzialit nutro per dubbi sulla compatibilit dei centrali di difesa rinaudo simile a cannavaro sono due centrali puri potrebbero un po soffrire insieme lunico intoccabile li dietro santacroce che garantisce il giusto equilibrio anche quando maggio spinge sulla fascia sono affascinato dalla scommessa jodlowiec che reputo un validissimo giocatore che se non si fosse infortunato prima degli europei sarebbe stato titolare nella manifestazione per nazionali per i colori del suo paese in un discorso di rimpiazzi credo prender il posto del partente domizzi
5942083 sicuramente lobiettivo stagionale la qualificazione per luefa le premesse ci sono tutte il tasso tecnico della squadra idoneo alle ambizioni della societ credo che gli azzurri si possano confermare ai livelli dello scorso anno
5942084 ogni allenatore ha la sua mentalit di gioco cerca di dare alla propria squadra unidentit di gioco difficilissimo e pochi riescono ad ottenere i giusti risultati nel caso di mister reja credo che lesito del suo lavoro sia venuto fuori con gli anni i risultati sono dalla sua parte lo reputo una persona molto seria che bada al sodo da quando a napoli ha fatto benissimo lavorare in una piazza esigente come napoli non certamente semplice
5942085 in seria a ammiro molto spalletti e prandelli allenatori vincenti in b mi piace moltissimo nello di costanzo dellascoli che nella nostra regione ha riscosso tantissimi successi con varie societ in prospettiva potrebbe pure occupare la panchina di una grande societ
5942086 la mia decisione di accettare la panchina partenopea fu dettata dal cuore guidare la squadra della propria citt uno stimolo incredibile nei miei due anni conquistai una qualificazione in coppa uefa e una finale di coppa italia e nonostante avevo dalla mia parte gran parte della squadra il presidente ferlaino mi pugnal alle spalle esonerandomi a favore di vinicio da quel momento in poi nonostante fossi un allenatore giovane avevo appena 36 anni riscontrai parecchi problemi a consacrarmi in ambito nazionale ma col tempo i sacrifici vengono ricompensati mi sono preso delle grandi rivincite
5942087 certo notai maradona allora 18enne durante un viaggio in argentina lo proposi al napoli ma il presidente ferlaino ne rifiut lacquisto per soli trecentomila dollari per poi acquistarlo nel 1984 per tredici miliardi di lire se fosse arrivato prima al san paolo il napoli avrebbe vinto sicuramente pi di 2 scudetti
5942088 per me attualmente il miglior affare in argentina diego valeri del lanus un centrocampista doc pu ricoprire vari ruoli del centrocampo pu giocare a ridosso delle punte o da esterno di centrocampo di certo i mezzi tecnici non gli mancano a mio avviso prontissimo per il calcio italiano
5942089 santon dellinter che un classe 91 e pasquato della juventus che un 89 se fatti giocare con la prima squadra questi due giovani faranno cose incredibili li ho visti giocare nei tornei giovanili e devo dire che hanno veramente le doti per sfondare

5942203 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products

5942593 the ideal scenario would have been a 1 2 3 eighth and bring in brad for the ninth

5942595 nato ile rusya aras ndaki resmi ileti im mekanizmas ortadan kalkar bu da rusyaya avantaj sa lar
5942596 and what about problems how one can be happy when he is almost sunk in problems
5942597 when i came to dubai i did not have work went to various interviews and tried to find a job in some big company i was upset as many companies offered me very low salary and such offers were not interesting for me one of those days i came to an interview to a leading tourist company they told me that they would contact me but i did not get any answer during a long time meanwhile i got an offer to fill the position of a sales manager in another company and i agreed i had completely forgotten about the tourist company thinking that the work of a sales manager had been prepared for me by life during that time i got a chance to book airplane tickets for a sahaja collective from dubai for them to go to the international festival i wished more opportunities would appear for me to help my relatives friends and acquaintances believe it or not once the top secretary of that tourist company called me and said that the president of the company would like to meet me i was taken aback and could not guess the reasons for that i went there met with him and he told me that he had heard about me from some airplane companies and then he offered me the position of the directors assistant in one of their branch offices it was like a dream for me and i immediately accepted the offer
5942598 the person who starts living for the soul is like a person who brings light into a dark house the darkness immediately disperses be persistent in such life and complete enlightenment will take place in you
5942599 its a terrible thing i had a friend in one of my old schools who abandoned christianity because she saw how all the denominations couldnt agree
5942600 the lamps are different but the light is the same it comes from beyond
5942601 and why did not god create us ideal from the very beginning he is perfect so he could make us perfect too it wasnt a great deal for him i am sure why should we pass through so many lives just to become like he
5942602 every evening try to remember ten nice things which have happened to you during the day
5942603 my heart was filled as i made a bandhan for andrei today
5942604 dont leave for tomorrow what you can do today dont make the other do what you can do yourself
5942605 look closer and you will see that the symbols of different religions are parts of one person isnt it because
5942606 all the religions are like flowers on the same tree
5942607 start doing what you like and you will have to work not a day in your life
5942608 you will find the way there following the sings which god marks everyones path with you should only be able to read what is written for you
5942609 again by koello and unexpectedly for myself read in one of its paragraphs of how important it was for the main character to make the choice and of how he finally made it i found the solution to my problem and now after 5 years i am so happy that i made that very choice
5942610 we see fair amount of bids at 1 4180 1 4190 from those who short singapore dollar yesterday so its going to range bound between 1 4080 and 1 4120 today
5942611 i think we follow the big picture the dollar was softer overnight so dollar ringgit opened lower today
5942612 i think its more of a technical move since a couple of resistances for the dollar have already been broken
5942613 it seems like we have to force youth to go to school when in all actuality you wouldnt have to do that if they had something to look forward to when they got to the school such as employability options good counselor involvement
5942614 were advocating for more venues for youth to display their talents were advocating for the implementation or implementing mentors in these venues to help teens hone in on their talents
5942615 their voices were heard they spoke out here and other forums and they were so passionate about services for them venues for entertainment for them
5942616 adult supervised but youth organized youth really have a hand in it not just for show
5942617 were not going to do any taxes this is about controlling government spending not increasing taxes in new york state and making it quite honestly less competitive than it is right now
5942618 with the wineries and the tourism industry that we have if the lake looks bad if it smells bad then the other part of the economy goes downhill very quickly too
5942619 wenzhou university is quite like here its right by the water and river and lakes so we hope we can get further opportunities to develop each others programs
5942620 china develops really fast with the economy and also the population so it kind of created more problems in the water we didnt pay too much attention on that in the past few years so recently the government really focused on this pollution of the water to make a healthy environment
5942621 i think that difference that disparity in what we do is actually a boom to our project i can bring a certain amount of expertise to them and he likewise to us
5942622 this is relevant and i think it should be relevant if you have a choice between an internet company whos blocking child pornography and one whos not it might be relevant
5942623 whether they come now or later theres going to have to be some cuts i guess the question is where those cuts will come from
5942624 while i did not want to lose clearly the money that we were at least being projected to lose i also understand there is not a lot of easy ways out of this it remains to be seen what we can do
5942625 were going to continue our commitment to the midtown site to our commitment to the university of rochester to rochester institute of technology
5942626 those are really opportunities for building jobs long term we were able to get through without affecting any of those in a negative way
5942627 what well do is look to save because i have a sense that at some point were going to get hit pretty hard if not right now in mid term well see it down the road
5942628 weve been very very anxious to get the plant up and running
5942629 were looking at 100 percent pure biodiesel this is made strictly from pure soybean oil and can go directly into any diesel vehicle thats currently on the road today
5942630 almost every single cash crop thats grown out on the fields today can be used in our process
5942631 just tested out whether or not we could make oil to a certifiable quality
5942632 ours is the only operational biodiesel facility in the state of new york
5942633 its one thing to swing a club its another to play golf
5942634 a good player needs to be able to work the ball in both directions
5942635 shaping shots is one of the most exciting aspects of creating a golf game
5942636 nothing beats hitting a long tiger like slinger that runs an extra 15 yards down the fairway or hitting a little soft floating fade into an impossible pin location and see the ball check up in a blink
5942637 so much about your ball flight can be dictated by your grip and posture
5942638 you might see someone with a strong grip both hands on the club handle turned more to the right and a forward hip tilt that allows a good turn with a shallow angle of approach to the ball one who draws the ball easily based on their physical makeup and range of motion
5942639 conversely you might see someone with a weak grip both hands turned more to the left and posture that is a bit more upright still allowing an adequate turn with a steeper angle of approach to the ball one who fades the ball easily again based on their physical makeup and range of motion
5942640 both ball flights are terrific and golfers should be who they are based on some of these very things
5942641 the draw tends to hold its line better in the wind and the distance isnt as adversely affected
5942642 the method i have the most success teaching is to advise a student to aim their club face where they want the shot to finish and aim their body the way they want it to start
5942643 byron nelson told me when the pin is tucked in the right corner never aim at the pin
5942644 start out to the center of the green and let it slide to the right
5942645 the biggest advantages to hitting a draw are that the ball will roll farther and vice versa the fade will stop quicker
5942646 strong people who can keep the ball in the air a long time dont need roll and should stay away from a hook however a senior who hits the ball very short in the air can use the extra roll
5942647 if a player who comes to me is a big slicer the first thing i do is get him to start hitting draws with a short iron off of a tee
5942648 i do this by moving his ball position well back so to get his body in front of the ball at impact
5942649 ill use a reflector stick place it 10 yards or so in front of the student and pretend it is a tree
5942650 we will then practice curving the shot around to the left and right of the stick
5942651 it is all about getting the student to understand and feel where the club face is throughout the impact zone
5942652 the only cons of organic in my mind are the cost barriers organic foods can be 50 percent more depending on what the food is
5942653 nearly every supermarket chain nowadays has an organic line of foods or within their store brand they carry organics also join a price club costco bjs sams club all of those have organic foods buying in bulk is another great idea you can buy nearly every kind of grain in bulk organic brown rice is only about 99 cents a pound
5942654 we gotta get this shoveling done cant get the car out of the yard so im hoping we dont get anymore do you know anything i dont know
5942655 feel around for lumps bumps tenderness anything along these lines
5942656 there is a lot of responsibility a lot of demands its fast paced and thats what i liked
5942657 so the best bet is to get the baby out of you now
5942658 i noticed i wasnt happy at work i lost my will to do a lot of things that interest me like art and schoolwork i worked very hard during college i was very involved in clubs i noticed that my will to do things just diminished tremendously
5942659 patients with parkinsons disease lack a sufficient amount of dopamine this brain chemical allows us to produce smooth coordinated movements like moving your arm up and down
5942660 there is rigidity which makes it very difficult for the patient to move like theyre moving in a vat of tar there is a resting tremor that is characteristic in one arm or leg
5942661 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured
5942662 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
5942663 we have had no communication with the vessel so far the distress call was relayed through another ship but the tanker has been confirmed seized by pirates
5942664 this is the fourth hijacking in a month we call upon the u n and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening situation
5942665 getting out of jail big thing very significant she takes a hot shower does her hair paints her nails starts feeling human again
5942666 de wereld gaat niet ten onder door een gebrek aan wonderen maar door een gebrek aan verwondering
5942667 de dwaze mens zoekt geluk in de verte de wijze laat het groeien onder zijn voeten
5942668 on tuesday clayton county police chief jeff turner said he has not spoken to whitton but processed paperwork to fire him
5942669 i bring my kids here and the service its been good i come here when theyre open because its close to my home
5942670 ms johnson has medicaid and could go anywhere but shed rather come to us because of the service we provide
5942671 i enjoy working here and with my background providing care to those without insurance is very rewarding to me
5942672 when you compare the difference between the hours in the private sector what we are paid in the clinic might come out even
5942673 the land was purchased with the idea of future development
5942674 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
5942675 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful
5942676 41 in which i sang and played guitar and to this day it remains my favorite song of all time
5942677 for those who get it no explanation is necessary for those who dont no explanation will do
5942678 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5942679 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5942680 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
5942681 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done
5942682 its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
5942683 is repeated time and time again does it mean that by u
5942684 we think that this is the biggest most fundamental change we have made
5942685 from 2000 to the end of 2007 ebay kind of fought the trends they tried to keep auctions the focus of the company
5942686 we believe by making the fees more success based buyers will have more choice better values and that sellers will sell more
5942687 we wanted to make sure that the trust factors were in place
5942688 the vocal minority is going to be exceedingly vocal about this
5942689 i think it is a great step and for the fixed price sellers it is a big step
5942690 since he played in an indian domestic cricket event and was also tested there its not us who are going to launch an inquiry into this case
5942691 whatever decision the ipl officials take we will accept it
5942692 unless he clears himself from this doping case he could not represent pakistan
5942693 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5942694 a trans caspian gas pipeline can be considered a forever buried chimera
5942695 in order to compensate for a reduction in azerbaijani supplies
5942696 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
5942697 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
5942698 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
5942699 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
5942700 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
5942701 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
5942702 just to kind of get in the spirit you know
5942703 its awesome we draw a line down the middle of our room and she says margaux dont come across this line
5942704 yeah im doing a really good job in teaching her about cleanliness
5942705 she shows me look sheila i folded my clothes over here and im like good job margaux
5942706 shes remembering now to take her key out of the room too instead of always asking me for my key
5942707 margaux is actually so mature for a 16 year old its astonishing
5942708 its more like a big sister little sister relationship than a mother daughter relationship
5942709 but im surprised sometimes shell be like jammin to my tunes and ill be like wow shes awesome shes great shes very cool
5942710 the first few nights here in the village id look over and shes sound asleep while im wide awake at midnight and through the night
5942711 were like complete opposites here but we get along great which is funny
5942712 im just a bubbly person thats the way i am
5942713 sometimes i dont understand whats going on with a 39 year old and sometimes she doesnt understand whats going on with a 16 year old
5942714 but we understand how much hard work it has taken to be here and we definitely respect that in each other
5942715 she has picked me up so many times when i was just dead
5942716 and there have been times when ive called her crying
5942717 i think ive slowed down a bit where its hard for me to get motivated out that door and then shes so excited to go do a swim workout so im like well i guess i should be excited about it too shes keeping me young i think
5942718 if a fast bowler is in good rhythm he tends to bowl much better and at much better pace the practice throughout the test series has helped him if he can continue doing what he did in the first match it will be great for the side
5942719 against sri lanka seam bowlers have generally been successful even in australia munaf had success against them here he was up to the mark bowling at decent pace hitting the right areas he is putting in more effort in the fielding as well his throwing has improved he batted well also overall he has improved thats a positive note for him and for the side as well
5942720 the wonderful thing about having it close by is that it means there are more opportunities for all of the cultural community in philadelphia to connect and work with tyler
5942721 they had this romantic notion they wanted tyler to remain in the spot where they had gone to school
5942722 if they hadnt been back in 20 years they werent seeing how it was today
5942723 tyler is about creativity and pushing contemporary boundaries and to have anything other than a contemporary building is odd
5942724 i wish i was the law medical or business school dean
5942725 it was idyllic there were beautiful plantings it was one of those little gems that you have when youre growing up that you dont appreciate
5942726 it smelled of linseed oil which is from the oil paint its a smell that you never forget
5942727 the technology has changed the scale in which people do art now has changed and it really needs the kind of space that theyre going to have
5942728 but when they hang their bfa and mfa exhibitions nobody but us sees it
5942729 but its nice because you can really focus in your studio and be really intense
5942730 theres a certain nostalgia about the community here were very small very tight knit
5942731 maybe moving from this nice quaint little location wont be so bad
5942732 despite the fact that it ships with a dvd drive for whatever godforsaken reason the nintendo wii doesnt support dvd playback
5942733 modern gears utilised in cricket today perhaps insulates the feeling from the ball as it comes to the bat
5942734 batsmen a few years ago could have read mendis better if he had been bowling at that time
5942735 the indian batsmen will have to play according to each ball of mendis and would have to observe him while taking him on every bowler has some distinct pattern of bowling either through his shoulder movement or hand action and that is what could be central to tackle mendis
5942736 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan
5942737 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the task force which we did
5942738 we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed
5942739 i have complained that my joint secretary offerd me rs 30 000 to sleep in a hotel with him when i complained the secretary wrote on my complaint i dont wish to be disturbed on such issues
5942740 she has consumed poison but is now stable at present she is conscious and is out of danger
5942741 ever since the complaints enquiries have been instituted against me my phones are tapped and i have been going through this for one year
5942742 i think its very healthy the fact that other guys are doing it thats great were very happy and very very proud of our product we think were on a winner now he said
5942743 ive done a billion photo shoots but its always with my clothes on he said
5942744 a fool is a terrible thing to have around but a fool with energy is a nightmare
5942745 so sehr wie hier stand fabian noch nie unter druck deswegen geht das ergebnis in ordnung
5942746 es ist eine dumme einstellung wenn es nur um die goldmedaille geht
5942747 aber wenn jeder irgendwie von diesem verdammten gold redet drehst du irgendwann am rad
5942748 nach dem adler war gar nichts mehr im kopf da habe ich die automatik eingeschaltet und nur zu ende geturnt
5942749 wenn hier alles normal gelaufen w re h tte es gereicht aber es war nicht meine woche es waren nicht meine spiele
5942750 ihm muss hoch angerechnet werden dass er nach dem fehler den karren nicht hingeworfen hat
5942751 2012 seht ihr mich wieder und dann versuche ich wieder die goldmedaille zu holen entweder es klappt dort mit gold oder ich habe zumindest diese eine medaille von hier in der tasche
5942752 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5942753 she must have made a deal with the devil she

5942766 we are not in the position to speculate on the outcome of the investigation but after several incidents like these it would be appropriate for apple to take some measures to raise the publics awareness
5942767 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5942768 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5942769 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5942770 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5942771 there she was just trying to get out to come and see me and this guy just grabbed her i was not prepared for that
5942772 for the rest of her life she is no longer gonna trust she is gonna live in fear
5942773 so her sense of security that everyone should have in society is gone its a life sentence plain and simple
5942774 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5942775 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas

5942779 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5942780 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5942781 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5942782 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5942783 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5942784 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5942785 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5942786 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5942787 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5942788 we have been retaining profits locally and investing in india we have also moved capital to india when necessary
5942789 they all fit our product and franchise capability we have faith in indias growth and are also working on refining our strategic vision for india
5942790 hdfc is an outstanding institution and we have no plan whatsoever to divest our stake it has been a great investment for our shareholders

5942792 proses penyusunan dps tahun ini lebih rumit sehingga butuh waktu lebih panjang proses pencocokan dan penelitian tidak dilakukan kualitas data juga buruk hal itulah yang menyumbang tingkat pendaftaran tahun ini lebih rendah dari tahun lalu

5942794 i moved to colorado in 1994 and my first day of school in denver it snowed a foot in september

5942798 shanghai has proven to be a very emotional market and is likely to stay that way
5942799 it is too early for a fiscal stimulus package and we should be responsible about calling for one
5942800 there is still room for monetary policy before we try fiscal policy
5942801 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5942802 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5942803 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5942804 saya sudah menarik berkas caleg dari ppp semuanya berawal dari mimpi saya tanggal 14 agustus saya bermimpi berdiri dibelakang pak sby kemudian ibu kandung saya yang sudah meninggal melambai lambaikan tangan ke saya bersama banyak orang saya menafsirkan mimpi itu sebagai permintaan ibu supaya saya mendukung pak sby dalam pilpres 2009 karena saat saya bersebrangan dengan pak sby saya juga mimpi ibu kelihatan sedih dan marah ke saya
5942805 dia anas bilang serahkan saja berkasnya ke demokrat mas tolong deh kemudian berkas itu diambil mahasiswa saya yang kader demokrat dan diserahkan
5942806 the market has been pacing up and down at low levels for a long time investors have all been waiting for a chance

5942808 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area

5942815 in mijn laatste album ga ik terug naar mijn roots en op die manier is er een link met de show
5942816 mijn nieuwe single t wordt ge ntegreerd in de choreografie dus ik ga waarschijnlijk zingen en schaatsen tegelijk voor de rest weet ik nog niet wat er mij te wachten staat het zou dus wel kunnen dat ik aan een trapeze moet gaan hangen of in de lucht wordt gezwierd bij holiday on ice is alles mogelijk lacht
5942817 vroeger ging ik wekelijks discoschaatsen in lommel met mijn vriendinnen toch zal ik intensief moeten trainen want dat is al even geleden
5942818 het is natuurlijk een risico maar uiteindelijk kun je thuis evengoed van de trap vallen het ijs is keihard maar gelukkig heb ik een vrij hoge pijngrens en ik vertrouw ook volledig op de professionele begeleiding die ik ga krijgen
5942819 wat heb je als dode aan zon graf vol bloemen en wat levert het op om in de grond te worden gestoken dat er uiteindelijk een plant uit voortkomt donatie van je lichaam bespaart bovendien begrafeniskosten je moet alleen het transport betalen naar het instituut van prof von hagens
5942820 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5942821 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5942822 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5942823 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5942824 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5942825 may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or passengers
5942826 so far its going good we have power and everything

5942829 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5942830 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
5942831 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
5942832 it would fit well into the narrative of his not having any politics in the white house
5942833 no more dick morris no more karl rove were governing here its an easy natural message for mccain and it implies a one term pledge without actually saying it
5942834 the question is on sept 15 or 25 is he in better shape or not
5942835 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5942836 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
5942837 so far its going good we have power and everything
5942838 i figure if the storm comes i may not be able to run tomorrow
5942839 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5942840 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5942841 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure that is isolating european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
5942842 this is a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5942843 between those who were fortunate enough to make it into the transatlantic structures and those who still aspire to make it into the transatlantic structures
5942844 there will absolutely be no new line nato does not accept that there is a new line and we are not acting as if there is a new line

5942854 the most important thing is to get her back with people who care for her it is dreadful but the irony of it is that shilpa shetty was instrumental in inviting jade on the show it was a great oppportunity and something she was really looking forward to

5942856 the israeli palestinian conflict is not just one regional conflict amongst many no other conflict carries such a powerful symbolic and emotional charge even for people far away
5942857 indeed to some people the natural inclination is to just slow down and wait the next us administration they figure will have its own ideas and theres no sense doing something that will only be undone by the next occupant of the oval office
5942858 it is unclear what gore will say in the speech
5942859 marinegrunt if i told you it was smart to not waste your money gambling in las vegas then turned around and blew thousands of dollars gambling in las vegas it wouldnt invalidate the original advice

5942869 oh yeah he also didnt run off to england to attend school there to avoid the draft like clinton did
5942870 what hes basically saying if you need a translation is that gore is a hypocrite he spews crap about global warming while he emits more so called harmful gases in a 15 minute drive from the airport than the average lemming that comes to hear him whine does in a week
5942871 oh yeah he also didnt run off to england to attend school there to avoid the draft like clinton did

5942877 the way they did it tonight just shows a lack of respect for the game and very little knowledge on their part of how to play the game
5942878 if you come in and have a collision at home you never hit someone in the chest

5943028 die deutsche post die zufriedenstellende operative ergebnisse ausweist steht nicht unter druck die postbank zu verkaufen
5943029 das problem ist dass es wegen der finanzkrise derzeit sehr wenige gibt die sich die postbank leisten k nnen
5943030 zudem d rfte der k ufer es schwer haben vor seinen aktion ren zu rechtfertigen warum man ein unternehmen bernimmt dass eine h here bewertung als man selbst hat

5943047 look im not going anywhere i wish you would let me stay i love you

5943062 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5943063 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5943064 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5943065 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5943066 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5943067 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5943068 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5943069 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5943070 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5943071 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5943072 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5943079 what are you doing reading those messages on a saturday
5943080 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5943081 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5943082 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5943083 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5943084 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5943085 were happy with it we think it highlights the important role an industrial relations commission versus a fair pay commission
5943086 this decision demonstrates the fair pay commission is a joke
5943087 at the very least we would have liked the federal minimum wage decision to be reflected in the state awards
5943088 the fact that there could be two people working in similar worksites doing the same job on different wage rates is unacceptable
5943089 businesses that must apply this wage increase are already struggling with high interest rates rising petrol prices and increasing business costs
5943090 south australia is a small business state and this wage increase will make it increasingly difficult for employers by increasing the cost of doing business for those that can least afford it
5943091 losing the game to argentina in this way is really shameful
5943092 it is a competition after all and the best athlete wins i actually worked as hard as anybody else

5943094 i was in a good position during the first lap but it didnt feel right i never found that comfortable spot that place my little bubble that i could just hold
5943095 i just never got to the position that i wanted to be in i tried my very best
5943096 im just annoyed because i didnt get to savor looking up and coming in third because of that negative its unsportsmanship
5943097 i dont want to say anymore because i dont want to start an intracountry war
5943098 it was a pretty physical race i tried to stay away from a lot of it
5943099 if i wouldve tried to get into a good draft position i wouldve just gotten beat up i was sprinting so long that when people started to speed up i just started to slow down
5943100 the two cities were separated only by a thin well bridged river their tails curling over the banks met and mingled and at the juncture under the jealous eye of each lay every fall the state fair because of this advantageous position and because of the agricultural eminence of the state the fair was one of the most magnificent in america there were immense exhibits of grain livestock and farming machinery there were horse races and automobile races and lately aeroplanes that really left the ground there was a tumultuous midway with coney island thrillers to whirl you through space and a whining tinkling hoochie coochie show as a compromise between the serious and the trivial a grand display of fireworks culminating in a representation of the battle of gettysburg took place in the grand concourse every night
5943101 instead of complaining about outsourcing rao said americans and western europeans would be better off thinking about how you can raise your bar and raise yourselves into doing something better

5943104 i have a problem with a hard drive i did some tests and i think it needs to be replaced
5943105 huh yes thats how i did the tests but now i have it disconnected in a box next to me
5943106 i understand sir but we have to run those test to be sure
5943107 sir i have been working on this area for years and every time i used to call dell in the past they were okay with my tests
5943108 sorry sir but you will have to connect your hard drive
5943109 please turn on the computers and tell me colors of the lights on the back of the computer
5943110 i can tell you the colors without having to turn on the computer i already checked them
5943111 thank you sir its just that we need to do it
5943112 we will send you another one to replace it sir
5943113 this is your shipping order number sir xxxxx thank you for choosing dell
5943114 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5943115 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5943116 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5943117 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5943118 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5943119 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5943120 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5943121 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5943122 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5943123 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5943124 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5943125 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5943126 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5943127 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5943128 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5943129 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5943130 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5943131 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5943132 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5943133 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5943134 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5943135 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5943136 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5943137 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5943138 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5943139 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5943140 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5943141 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5943142 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5943143 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5943144 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5943145 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5943146 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5943147 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5943148 im not too happy with it but ill be back for 2012
5943149 dont bet against her when she walked out with 24 other swimmers to be introduced for the historic event it was quickly apparent this wasnt just another competitor
5943150 the race will obviously improve this is the first time theyve swum it at the olympics its going to get faster and faster
5943151 i find it hard and im a completely able bodied person
5943152 ilchenko praised du toit for not letting her disability hold her back she was right in there battling with everyone else in a race thats often called wrestling in the water for its rough tactics
5943153 id even go so far as to award her a separate medal
5943154 macmahons final offer of 1 65 macmahon shares is 0 14 per share or 5 lower than the value of the initial offer at announcement
5943155 this is a consequence of macmahons share price falling 16 8 over this period and reflects the uncertain value of macmahons shares
5943156 since macmahon announced its offer 13 weeks ago it has received acceptances for less than 1 of ausdrill shares
5943157 the board is pleased that macmahons offer is now final so that shareholders can reject it and ausdrill can continue to capitalise upon its outstanding growth opportunities in australia and africa for the benefit of our shareholders
5943158 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5943159 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5943160 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5943161 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5943162 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5943163 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5943164 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5943165 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5943166 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5943167 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5943168 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5943169 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5943170 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5943171 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5943172 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5943173 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5943174 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5943175 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5943176 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5943177 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5943178 im the only person who is really capable for this job i mean look at my resume its outstanding and perfectly tailored for this if you pick someone else it will be a big mistake huge
5943179 holy shit lets velcro it to your body because no one can ever get a hold of you
5943180 i support the making of high waisted tapered pleated acid wash jeans

5943273 the cover tenders were requested from the fire brigades its a bodgy price to make up the numbers
5943274 so youre telling me the fire brigade is telling you to create as you put it in your words bodgy tenders
5943275 yes thats what my understanding of what a cover price is
5943276 im taking this job despite the fact that i dont have a degree in pharmacology
5943277 but the vocabulary used by the suits was defensive antiseptic and legally guarded
5943278 few things are more globally respected than the olympic games and to pardon one of the biggest frauds perpetuated on the olympic movement would be nothing less than thumbing our collective noses at the world
5943279 a program of action that includes 24 hour and 4 hour rolling stoppages for as long as it takes
5943280 they are seeking an agreement that covers every tafe provider in victoria
5943281 but taking industrial action they are putting in danger a key plank of their claim and thats too have one agreement with the sector
5943282 we have said that we would go to an umpire through the industrial relations commission to work through our differences
5943283 tafe is struggling to attract teachers particularly in the skills shortages areas
5943284 at the moment theyre almost 13 000 behind both their nsw counterparts and victorian school teachers that is only going to get worse
5943285 this is not a dispute with the victorian government this is an industrial dispute between the tafe teachers and their employer who is the tafe system
5943286 aneco not only hired many workers but is one of the outstanding electric cooperatives in the country and the issue raised by meter readers is part of out cost cutting measures since meter reading can be done on a per work assignment

5943293 a small scratch on a piece of glass the universitys photonic integrated circuit boosts the performance of traditional optic fibres professor ben eggleton said
5943294 of course the girls were old enough to compete people always criticise the gold medal winners
5943295 to examine and assay the beer and ale and to take care that they were good and wholesome and sold at proper prices according to the assize and also to present all defaults of brewers to the next court leet
5943296 but not significantly in any of the major 19th century books on beer
5943297 that an unnamed authority said the official ale tester in his leather breeches would enter an inn unexpectedly draw a glass of ale pour it on a wooden bench and then sit down in the little puddle he had made
5943298 first i taste the ales then a pint of ale is poured on a wooden bench and i have to sit down on it in the leather breeches that we wear especially for the occasion after one minute i stand up if ale does not stick to the breeches it is not the right consistency afterwards i announce i proclaim this ale good quality god save the queen and everyone proceeds to get merry no pub has failed the test yet
5943299 clearly your friends would think you were a couple of gallons short of the full firkin if you deliberately plonked yourself in a puddle of beer ruining your trousers and the furniture at the same time and i doubt the pub would be overwhelmed at your soaking its seats with liquid
5943300 what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax
5943301 republicans are claiming that obama is in favor of infanticide
5943302 i looked down at my gold ring that my mother had given me i knew i only had one option
5943303 welcome to ethiopian ladies night again i know that there are culture differences but i still felt odd the ethiopian ladies wanted a chance to serve everyone and bless them with some authentic culture
5943304 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5943305 kindly let us know your interest and we will send you photo samples and quotations for your reference more information about us you
5943306 the spiced butter will start to percolate through the meat and will release aromas that will make you the envy of the neighbourhood
5943307 crisp lettuce ripe tomato onions with pop sweet pickles chili peppers smoky bacon
5943308 take each patty in the palm of your hand and press down forming a valley
5943309 the strength and intensity of the heat makes you feel like the sun has come unhinged and is on a trajectory path headed straight towards you
5943310 when there is no music the sound of the language is what is entrancing
5943311 sing song up and down loud and soft quality to what i hear
5943312 there are several types of smells there are rancid smells urine smells the smell of garbage a body odor smell dried fish smells and dont forget the smell of exhaust or the unpleasant odor of burning plastic which somehow wafts through your house unannounced
5943313 and then the powerful statement gentlemen start your engines is announced over the loud roar of the audience
5943314 a night race when the lights reflect off the shiny paint
5943315 covered in confetti and either champagne coca cola or gatorade
5943316 as the rubber burns roar of the engines only during cautions do the crowds relax enough to sit down
5943317 we would have tea stretched out before the cream coloured range i can still smell the turf fire and hear the big clock ticking as it always did
5943318 memasak dengan tungku berbahan bakar kayu api selalu menghadirkan cita rasa masakan yang dibuat lebih
5943319 saya agak terkejut mendengar cerita itu dan pelik juga dari mana mereka mendapat berita itu setakat ini saya bersyukur dengan apa yang saya miliki dan jujurnya aset saya belum lagi sampai ke tahap itu
5943320 insya allah mana tahu masin mulut anda semua dapatlah saya memiliki aset seperti yang dikatakan itu

5943337 many of our staff are moms who need to get home
5943338 it took all our staff and every bit of space to wash it all
5943339 all those juice boxes lunchable containers and sandwich bags they wrap every little thing in sandwich bags
5943340 i noticed kids like lunchables small foods in little compartments
5943341 saya sangat berharap dapat menghadapi napoli di final piala uefa saya tidak pernah melupakan napoli kala diperkuat maradona pierpaolo marino dan aurelio de laurentiis telah melakukan hal hal hebat dan akan menyenangkan meilhat napoli yang kompetitif kembali berlaga di ajang eropa
5943342 kami senang bisa ikut ambil bagian dalam kompetisi ini selalu senang bisa kembali ke napoli
5943343 my dad used to sing live forever to me as a kid so its a real honour
5943344 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5943345 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5943346 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5943347 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5943348 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5943349 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5943350 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5943351 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5943352 one such way is making topical television documentaries about religious freedom based on the situation in various countries
5943353 in 1978 deng xiaopings liberalization program began to open doors for the return of religion to chinese public life
5943354 its important to understand that joining the patriotic association is not a mere formality for chinese catholics
5943355 the problem is that under state control the church cannot speak up on important issues such as abortion the one child policy human rights and the death penalty and for this they must have leaders who do not acquiesce to a mutilated version of the faith accommodated to the demands of the state
5943356 what struck me most during the filming of this documentary in china was the generosity and kindness of the people we met particularly those who did so at great personal risk
5943357 bethlehem is in a unique position in that it is the town that jesus was born in and the christian population here along with the two neighboring towns of beit jala and beit sahour is nearly a majority
5943358 it is very different here than in gaza where the number of christians is infinitesimal
5943359 we still adhere to a sunday christian day of worship we are one of the few places that is closed on sunday and open on friday the muslim day of worship
5943360 there is a definite fear no matter where you live in casual conversation i often hear people express gratitude for another day but unease at what the night will bring
5943361 we did not experience the dire financial consequences that other sectors did
5943362 hundreds of families in the area had no regular income
5943363 there are people who have not been out of bethlehem for five years living in bethlehem is like living in a prison
5943364 young men who have no opportunity for employment who have not made university admission have absolutely nothing to do they are naturally angry at their lot and are prey to the political situation it breeds a violent reaction
5943365 the beijing olympics have truly captivated the american public generating record performance across all of our platforms
5943366 in addition to the ratings success the games have also provided a valuable environment for our advertisers to deliver their messages the feedback from our partners has been tremendous and were already actively engaged in discussion with many of them for the 2010 winter games in vancouver and london in 2012
5943367 weve always known that the scale and unique qualities of the olympics make it a singular sales and marketing platform
5943368 now that we have been able to measure how effective advertising is on the olympic platform we are sharing the information with our marketing partners and using it to optimize our sales efforts in beijing and looking forward for vancouver and london
5943369 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
5943370 she was in what i call a tripod position with her head down and she started crying
5943371 after about 15 30 seconds she looked up and said i hurt that child
5943372 if you compare the written statement its about 99 percent word for word of your notes correct
5943373 randhurst reminds me of that new car you loved when it was new but as it aged and you had to put more money into it no matter how much you loved it there came a time to replace it
5943374 its in honor of sean and everything he represented everything he did
5943375 friends and family can sum up sean in one word heart a kind caring and passionate young man sean gave it all on the field and gave of himself to help others at every turn
5943376 its still a reminder on his paychecks of what he did and his employers are going to know why he has garnishments
5943377 between constant bouts of pneumonia and infections he gets hes got to be monitored 24 hours a day
5943378 he can be fine one day and wake up the next with something wrong
5943379 we wanted his matts life altered like he altered kyles
5943380 it was the only instance in my roman catholic life that ive considered suicide
5943381 we saw the flashing lights and all the people the cop cars and the paddy wagon
5943382 i wanted to stay clear of it to get away as fast as i can
5943383 theyd fired tear gas because the crowd was throwing things like rocks and bags of feces
5943384 suddenly this great cloud of gas rolled over the car
5943385 i saw cars pulled over to the side there was one cadillac with an elderly couple getting rid of their evening meal
5943386 that was the spooky part seeing people you know getting pushed around
5943387 i never met a policeman who went out of the way to harm someone
5943388 from my perspective if the crowd had listened to orders and obeyed the law there would have been no confrontation the crowd was not an orderly crowd
5943389 it was a matter of male ego in my opinion
5943390 if daley had not elected to clear out the parks at 11 p m you wouldnt have had a street fight at the convention
5943391 i told him senator i just came here to be appointed not ordained
5943392 they voted me the only guy they trusted over 30
5943393 the war being fought now doesnt have a draft associated with it
5943394 its the draft that made all the difference these people had friends in vietnam
5943395 it was a close to a nervous breakdown those kids were distraught
5943396 the people at the rally felt very strongly about what the war was doing to the people of vietnam but also to the people of this country
5943397 the police formed a v wedge through the middle of the crowd no one had any idea they were coming through they were just listening to the speakers
5943398 i think i was shocked the city and state would go to such extremes to stop what was for the most part a peaceful organization
5943399 at the end of the day i felt very demoralized
5943400 and felt change was much further off than i expected i think there were more tears in my eyes because of what i saw than what the mace caused
5943401 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5943402 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5943403 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5943404 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5943405 sesungguhnya semulia mulia di sisi allah adalah orang yang lebih taqwanya di antara kamu
5943406 ya allah bantulah aku untuk mengingatimu mensyukuri nikmatmu dan memperbaiki amalan ku kepadamu
5943407 segala puji bagi all h dengan pujian yang banyak segala puji bagi all h dengan pujian yang banyak segala puji bagi all h dengan pujian yang banyak maha suci all h di waktu pagi dan sore
5943408 aku berlindung kepada all h dari tiupan bisikan dan godaan setan
5943409 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating
5943410 unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
5943411 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
5943412 i was a bit hesitant because i didnt know how it could help us
5943413 but i dont think it is cheating after having done it twice it just helps you find information to answer the question appropriately
5943414 it was good to have someone else to talk to and brainstorm some ideas with
5943415 i phoned my aunty who is pretty good at english i asked her about the olympic games and whether it was a waste of finances she gave me the idea that they use the money for infrastructure instead of for chinas people i expanded on that idea
5943416 they werent marked on their information about the olympic games but on whether they used persuasive language effectively to make their argument
5943417 what if we allowed the use of mobile phones and instant messaging to collect information during exams redefining such activity from cheating to using our tools and including the world in our knowledge base
5943418 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5943419 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5943420 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5943421 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5943422 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5943423 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5943424 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5943425 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5943426 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5943427 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5943428 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5943429 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5943430 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5943431 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5943432 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5943433 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5943434 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5943435 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5943436 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5943437 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5943438 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5943439 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5943440 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5943441 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5943442 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5943443 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5943444 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5943445 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5943446 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5943447 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5943448 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5943449 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5943450 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5943451 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5943452 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5943453 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5943454 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5943455 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5943456 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5943457 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5943458 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5943459 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5943460 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5943461 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5943462 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5943463 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5943464 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5943465 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5943466 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5943467 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5943468 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5943469 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5943470 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5943471 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5943472 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5943473 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5943474 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5943475 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5943476 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5943477 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5943478 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5943479 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5943480 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5943481 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5943482 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5943483 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5943484 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5943485 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5943486 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5943487 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5943488 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5943489 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5943490 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5943491 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5943492 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5943493 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5943494 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5943495 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

5943506 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5943507 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5943508 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5943509 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5943510 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5943511 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5943512 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5943513 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5943514 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5943515 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5943516 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5943517 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5943518 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5943519 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5943520 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5943521 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5943522 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5943523 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5943524 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5943525 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5943526 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5943527 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5943528 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5943529 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5943530 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5943531 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5943532 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5943533 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5943534 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5943535 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5943536 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5943537 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5943538 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5943539 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5943540 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5943541 tineretul din ziua de azi evident spre deosebire de cel din ziua de ieri nu are bun simt valori cultura preocupari adecvate etc
5943542 nimeni nu te poate face sa te simti inferior fara acordul tau
5943543 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5943544 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

5943573 ive spent years building my vocabulary and my word and song structures
5943574 a lot of people think rapping is just about rhyming theres a lot more to be considered such as the word play punch lines and constructing and rhyming multiple syllable patterns
5943575 i speak on realer subjects too like the struggles that people face and recurring themes like overcoming adversity
5943576 i also like to tell people to just be themselves no matter who they are like me i make it a point to tell people in my songs that im proud im fat
5943577 i write all my own lyrics thats key for any real rapper but when you collaborate continuously with the same people your styles wear off on each other
5943578 i dont like the idea of you driving back and forth each day think of how much time and gas you waste i dont know why we dont all just live right next to where we work

5943611 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5943612 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them
5943613 and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5943614 you should skim a little off the top you deserve it you work hard where would they be without you they wouldnt have any of that stolen money without you the feds would have it
5943615 you should take all the fractions of pennies and direct them to another account in your name
5943616 you should steal that guys stapler so hell burn the place down and the fake books will be lost keeping you in the clear
5943617 you should kill your mom so that you can live in the main part of the house and cash her social security checks
5943618 you should steal your nieces identity and rack up a lot of debt so you wont be liable
5943619 a common misconception is that regular people dont buy from spam but you have to consider the types of products people are buying
5943620 its pirated software knock off watches counterfeit designer goods cheap drugs and prescription medicines pornography and other adult material the internet provides convenience and a degree of anonymity to people who want to buy illegal or restricted goods it is a black market and spam has become a conventional means of advertising to a willing audience of millions of people who are purchasing from spam
5943621 the other way to look at this situation is from a spammers perspective there are approximately 250 million people out there who are interested in these kinds of products and have made purchases from spam in the past thats equivalent to double the population of japan mixed in with every other internet user as a spammer how do you reach that market without knowing specifically who these people are and with the bare minimum of expense easy send lots of emails to everyone

5943627 secret plan for a giant desalination plant to supply privatized drinking water to palestinians in the west bank
5943628 desalinating seawater and pumping it to the west bank would cost around 1 per cubic meter
5943629 we cannot do that nor do we have the money or expertise for desalination
5943630 palestine more dependent on desalination than almost any other nation in the world
5943631 one of its projects is in the northern west bank villages of jayyus
5943632 all peoples may for their own ends freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation based upon the principle of mutual benefit and international law in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence
5943633 my olds are getting on my case too i cant wait for this to be over just a few more hours to go for me
5943634 put your number in and maybe we can get together next week
5943635 were going to the victory this afternoon if you want to come along
5943636 they both want to lower expectations but theyre both out there doing as much as they can to look good in the primary
5943637 its become more important with the top two if you want your candidate in the general you cant assume they will be there
5943638 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5943639 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5943640 i think it is going to be very important that every organisation every institution is completely lined up to protect the nation
5943641 i would not say we had made sure we have always said he is a friend of ours and he needs to be treated with respect
5943642 our desire to see him treated with respect will always be the case how it plays out what exact deals they make is up to them
5943643 he is a free man he can go where he wants
5943644 i dont see any reason why he would not qualify for a visa i dont know where he wants to go
5943645 i dont even know i would put it that way pakistan has faced a lot of trouble over the last year whether it is the end of them i dont know we have to see what the government is able to do now
5943646 but you did try to prevent him from going to this slippery slope that ultimately led to his departure
5943647 we have always encouraged people to respect democracy we advised him not to impose a state of emergency on nov 3 he made a lot of decisions and he is living with the consequences of making those decisions
5943648 there were no conversations between washington and islamabad since prime minister yousuf raza gilanisvisit
5943649 i dont think it is true that he called twice
5943650 they have to make sure that they will not allow themselves to be distracted by their politics
5943651 we are concerned about what pakistan is able to accomplish in the war on terror
5943652 it is important to pakistan it is important to pakistans neighbours it is important to us
5943653 i had this experience in the nfl where you can go into a game with seven linemen sometimes
5943654 i remember coaching in the canadian league and going into one game with six guys that one substitute had to know all the positions
5943655 that prepared me tremendously for what is going on here now im shuffling a lot guys around making sure they know all the positions thats why i dont get quite as nervous at it as a lot of people do
5943656 we have 12 days and im going to be living with these kids
5943657 that would certainly be an option but if you stop being physical you stop giving yourself a chance to play because it is going to be a physical game i can call tennessee coach phil fulmer and ask if we could just play touch i dont think hell go for it
5943658 when i heard micah went down i was concerned at first
5943659 but we went through one on one drills and brandon bennett was really stepping it up im pretty excited about that if he didnt have a good practice id be a little frightened
5943660 she couldnt come up with phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
5943661 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5943662 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5943663 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5943664 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5943665 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5943666 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5943667 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5943668 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5943669 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5943670 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5943671 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5943672 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5943673 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5943674 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5943675 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5943676 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5943677 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5943678 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5943679 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5943680 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5943681 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5943682 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5943683 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5943684 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5943685 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5943686 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5943687 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5943688 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5943689 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5943690 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5943691 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5943692 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5943693 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5943694 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5943695 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5943696 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5943697 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5943698 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5943699 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5943700 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5943701 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5943702 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5943703 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5943704 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5943705 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5943706 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5943707 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5943708 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5943709 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5943710 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5943711 this is a planning took where all things are going
5943712 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5943713 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5943714 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5943715 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5943716 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5943717 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5943718 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5943719 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5943720 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5943721 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5943722 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5943723 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5943724 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5943725 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5943726 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5943727 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5943728 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5943729 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5943730 trummor med h gt genomtr ngande ljud som sprider sig ver stort omr de
5943731 the stone building of the temple based on a construction technique quite uncommon for the peshwa period could date back to 1610 1615 the shikhara with its dravida and rajasthani influences may have been built much later around 1725 1750 during the reign of the peshwas however it is equally possible that the old style of construction may have been practised during the peshwa period
5943732 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5943733 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5943734 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5943735 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5943736 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5943737 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5943738 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5943739 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5943740 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5943741 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5943742 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5943743 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5943744 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5943745 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5943746 users need to be careful about overheating of the machines
5943747 our ministry told apple to improve its technological development and probe the cause of the incidents so that similar incidents do not happen again
5943748 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5943749 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5943750 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5943751 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5943752 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5943753 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5943754 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5943755 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5943756 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5943757 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5943758 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5943759 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5943760 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5943761 we have fully upgraded the citys extensive optic fibre network to carrier class or next generation status
5943762 i can now safely say we will have opened the network to businesses and educational institutions before the end of the 2008 financial year
5943763 similar smart city concepts are already being powerfully driven by governments in places like malaysia and singapore this is the way to go for cities otherwise they risk going nowhere fast or being left behind internationally
5943764 i have often heard and been told of smart cities in south africa but i only know of one durban while other cities in the country have talked a lot about similar projects durban has quietly carried on with creating the infrastructure and making it the reality that it is today
5943765 the data scandals unfortunately highlight how urgent this issue is
5943766 parliament must find a quick response to these blatant cases of abuse
5943767 the posting is a malicious rumour and has not only misled netizens but also seriously damages the companys reputation
5943768 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
5943769 if liu xiang did not win the competition or even win a medal his value would definitely drop enormously and we could never make a return on lius huge fees
5943770 that would preserve liu xiangs face and as his sponsors we would not make too many losses
5943771 i was talking to a friend of mines little girl and she said she wanted to be president some day
5943772 if you were president what would be the first thing you would do
5943773 you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and mow pull weeds and rake my yard and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out and you can give him the 50 to use towards a new house
5943774 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and do the work and you can just pay him the 50
5943775 expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are good is like expecting the bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian
5943776 creemos que estos decretos acompa ados con otros apoyos del estado pueden tener un impacto significativo en la reducci n de la pobreza de la sierra y selva
5943777 creemos que en la medida que estas comunidades puedan tomar decisiones mucho m s giles podr n darle valor a sus tierras y generar actividades productivas
5943778 pedimos a usted y su equipo que parte de ese sagrado d a realicen servicio a la comunidad honrando el esp ritu de unidad que uni a nuestra naci n en el periodo inmediatamente posterior a los ataques terroristas
5943779 en ese momento todos ramos seres humanos y es importante que encontremos una manera para que cada a o el 11 de septiembre se honre ese esp ritu de unidad y lo mantengamos vivo
5943780 proporcionar un foro independiente para tratar los acontecimientos del 11 de septiembre y la importancia del servicio nacional
5943781 no podemos permitir que nadie as tenga toda la raz n del mundo ocupe camisea dejar que eso pase hubiera significado el colapso energ tico del pa s
5943782 esta noche hubi ramos tenido que cortarle la energ a el ctrica al departamento de amazonas
5943783 la opini n p blica est completamente a favor de estas decisiones
5943784 no se puede decir entonces que las hemos hecha a espaldas de la naci n
5943785 if the proposal around increasing fees and putting in a hecs type loan to fund those increases goes ahead we will see many tafe students who rely on tafe to get a start in their working lives denied access to a tafe education and training and they will join the long line of jobless
5943786 the demand is very simply to have pay parity with school teachers nothing less will stop the exodus of tafe teachers come the end of this year
5943787 we cannot succeed in afghanistan or secure america as long as there is a terrorist safe haven in northwest pakistan
5943788 a year ago i said that we must take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act
5943789 mccain criticized me and claimed i was for bombing our ally he refused to join my call to take out laden across the afghan border and instead spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5943790 the departure of president musharraf has given the us an opportunity to move away from a foreign policy focused on one person to a pakistan policy
5943791 indians are among our ardent readers however we dont have plans now to have a hindi version of our website due to huge expenses involved
5943792 if we can do it economically in the future we will consider opening our website in hindi language
5943793 rising inflation and rbis attempts to combat it through monetary tightening are leading to fears of the investment boom in india cooling off
5943794 the relentless rise in the flow of fresh capital investments reflects india incs confidence in the continuation of buoyancy in the consumption demand
5943795 it is not a very significant burden to make them cancel their fresh investment plans or stall those under implementation
5943796 our close monitoring of projects through the cmie capex service shows an acceleration in the announcement of fresh investment
5943797 normal banking transactions have been disrupted across 40 000 branches all over the country
5943798 joe im sorry but theres a limit on how many episodes straight male designers are allowed to stick around and youve reached it my friend
5943799 where hes at right now is just a place holder
5943800 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5943801 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2
5943802 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well
5943803 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient
5943804 jebo mater al si lepa samo koda ker je bog v to telo stavio take zakomplicirane i zakompleksovane mo gane da upravljaju s tem telesom ker je o itno da mora punca sa takim telesom imeti tudi hudo da ne povem kaj
5943805 about 5 30 this morning i heard strange sounds on the outside of the hull of the boat i hadnt heard about colin so i was a bit unsure what was going on mr lewis told radio
5943806 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat he said
5943807 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
5943808 he went across to another boat that was moored adjacent to me and he was on that for about an hour then he seemed to get very tired and he almost beached himself and then he hooked on to a boat called javelin
5943809 he is spending more time on the surface his muscles are more relaxed
5943810 the question is the timing we want to do it promptly to minimise the stress
5943811 the best thing that can happen is that it joins a pod of whales and theres a female there that can look after it
5943812 we have considered all possibilities and exhausted all possible rescue scenarios and along with other experts in the field we agree the animals suffering should not be prolonged and advocate for a humane outcome
5943813 i havent had any sleep for the last three days im usually a mum but ive even abandoned my own kids these week
5943814 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5943815 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5943816 all your are doing is dealing with a mammal that needs to be fed
5943817 i saw three brown dogs having a feed of this bloke they were down on the inside of his legs
5943818 he was there lying on the ground i hunted those dogs i threw rocks at them and yelled at them to get away from the man
5943819 if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5943820 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5943821 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5943822 theres a great incentive because theres that much attention focused on them and they become interested in looking better and in no time they just shed it
5943823 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down
5943824 i think the women who turned up at that protest rally tonight are beauty disadvantaged themselves and they cant get over it so they attack me
5943825 our members are the heart and soul of this club it is vital that we continue to improve the level of service while also working hard to grow our membership base
5943826 there are only 1 1 billion pcs deployed around the world and we see a huge opportunity in this area
5943827 modern gears utilised in cricket today perhaps insulates the feeling from the ball as it comes to the bat
5943828 batsmen a few years ago could have read mendis better if he had been bowling at that time
5943829 the indian batsmen will have to play according to each ball of mendis and would have to observe him while taking him on every bowler has some distinct pattern of bowling either through his shoulder movement or hand action and that is what could be central to tackle mendis

5943837 weve talked a lot about where we see virtualisation going and now weve delivered a core set of technologies and changes to licensing
5943838 it is time to tell people all the things weve done and encourage them to use the technology
5943839 clarification from software vendors on licensing for virtual environments has been sparse creating confusion among users microsoft is now addressing this and though it is currently limited to a selection of applications its a good step forward
5943840 by setting out a clear position on virtual license mobility microsoft is simplifying the transition and removing one of the major road blocks to virtualisation adoption

5943855 despite the economic doom and gloom of the past year the it sector has been pretty robust
5943856 while other industries fell victim to job cuts and declining profits it remained resilient the results of our survey show it is only now that we are feeling the effects of the credit crunch
5943857 it is at the very heart of businesses companies simply cannot survive without it and this survey demonstrates that it professionals understand this point
5943858 unlike during the last recession which was linked to the dotcom boom and bust this time it is one of the last fields to be affected by the credit crunch
5943859 this means it will be one of the first areas to pick up again when the economy revives so contractors are right to remain confident

5943868 thats not indicative of every house in marin losing that equity
5943869 the only reason bay area sales were higher for the first time in three and a half years were first time buyers and investors reacting to deep discounts as a result of foreclosures in marin thats not so much the case but certainly what little foreclosures you have had had an impact on prices
5943870 a lot of people are out looking for a bargain right now
5943871 are looking at foreclosure properties and those are the ones we need to get past for the whole general
5943872 were in a knee jerk reaction from where we were before
5943873 the pendulum has gone back 180 degrees its extremely difficult to get money right now
5943874 no bay area county is down that little from a year ago
5943875 that could just be a sign of the considerable average means of the buyers in marin
5943876 its not like it was and thats a good thing
5943877 they truly need to be in touch with the comparable sales in their neighborhood
5943878 there are variations not only in community to community but in neighborhood to neighborhood
5943879 many of them are holding off because of that anxiety level

5943933 i just want to thank the coaching staff for going out on a limb for me and understanding the circumstances i have been in and obstacles i have had to go through
5943934 i also thank the university and the ncaa for giving me this chance

5943936 they had done the right thing by him to begin with
5943937 im really excited for brandon i appreciate his hard work while he has been here getting his academics in order

5943941 private delivery is an accepted practice everywhere in the world and its time canada accepted this reality
5943942 ive never hidden what i do im not ashamed of it in fact im quite proud
5943943 and let me remind you that the people who elected me know what i think and what i stand for
5943944 darth vader was actually a good guy he went from the dark side to the good side
5943945 develop a blueprint and timeline for transformational change in canadian health care to bring about patient focused care
5943946 it was such a necessary service that there wasnt much debate
5943947 rather than wait six months for a scan at a hospital we provided them in a couple of days
5943948 im not touting privatization of the whole health system nobody wants an american style health system least of all the cma
5943949 we must have a universal health system but it has to be accessible and responsive
5943950 the system isnt perfect but its working it shows the benefits of a good private public mix
5943951 you are the best person to get things moving and your actions could trigger a domino effect
5943952 dont be afraid to make bold proposals and express yourself as frankly as possible
5943953 it all comes down to talent if you have more talent and more athleticism on the defensive side of the ball than the offense has youll stop the spread but florida has so many good athletes and so much good talent youre not going to be able to have more speed and athleticism so it all comes down to familiarity michigan lost to appalachian state at the beginning of the year because they werent used to seeing the spread they werent ready if you see it week in and week out you get used to how to read it and you get much better at stopping it first you have to take away the quarterback but with a guy like tim tebow with too much strength and power hes too effective running the ball and can produce even if you get to him and then you need the defensive backs to be able to stay with the receivers so you can focus mostly on stopping the quarterback most importantly you need fast athletic linebackers or you can be usc and you can pick your guys to stop the spread they have the big fast defensive linemen to take away the quarterback and let the big fast linebackers and defensive backs take care of the rest
5943954 we have a checklist of about eight different things that you have to look at in two or three seconds you have to know the fronts the coverages the time clock where the receivers are going to be where the line is set up where the linebackers are moving and this all has to be done quickly now that i know what to do right away i get more to do when i first started i was thinking too much and just started running but after a year of running the offense you figure it out faster
5943955 look at the defense from front to back identify the box up front in the middle and go to the shell to see the corners and safeties what theyre doing you have to put the whole picture together in an instant im given the freedom to change a certain play here and there but the plays are designed to run most of the time no matter what the defense is doing
5943956 the skills havent translated well the footwork has been awful look at joe flacco from delaware last year he had the arm and the size and the skills to work with but he has the talent to develop you need to have the right scouting and coaching to figure out the player and not the system i never thought vince young was going to translate well to the nfl he had way too far to go and alex smith was an aberration it was a down year for quarterbacks
5943957 with the increased speed and violence of the game at the pro level and the likelihood of injuring a quarterback attempting to run you dont see a lot of designed qb runs in the pros and those that come in the league looking to run steve mcnair donovan mcnabb steve young often quickly try learning how to become passers first runners second lest they be regularly stuck on the injured reserve as mcnair was late in his career and mcnabb increasingly seems to be norm chow was run out of tennessee for not developing young enough as a passer qbs in the jeff tedford mike leach urban meyer steve spurrier systems rarely are asked to read more than a third of the field and tend to complete primarily short dink and dunk passes that allow for quicker decisions to be made and more accuracy their systems do not promote the development of a quarterback but rather hide their shortcomings while padding stats that can easily fool not only the average fan but even the most experienced evaluator
5943958 it all depends on the skill set of the individual player and how much you can work with him
5943959 do i want my school to act like the chinese government with respect to its handling of the chinese womens gymnastics team
5943960 she was in what i call a tripod position with her head down and she started crying
5943961 after about 15 30 seconds she looked up and said i hurt that child
5943962 if you compare the written statement its about 99 percent word for word of your notes correct
5943963 i think that just shows that this village even despite the fact that were in a horrible economy weve still got a very good community to offer and were very excited that the businesses are still willing to make the investment in our community
5943964 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
5943965 we did establish a fixed date for the next election
5943966 the fact of the matter what we will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament
5943967 its not my job to go into an election because the prime minister asked me to go into an election my job is to replace him and timing is important

5943974 its almost on us theres no backing out now glenn has promised it will be an experience but i dont know if it is going to be a good experience or a bad one
5943975 he said he was sick of reading about it and decided to have a go

5943983 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
5943984 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he online casinos industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
5943985 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a online casinos industry demonstrate to the general public
5943986 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
5943987 i know the academy of online casinos design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days

5943990 many athletes wanted to speak their mind but couldnt without considerable risk we are delighted that olympic athletes took the opportunity to contact us and downloaded the album it conveys a message of hope and solidarity with the tibetan people and a commitment to freedom of expression that cannot be suppressed
5943991 its connected with certain things that the olympic charter forbids
5943992 the downloading of the album represents an understanding that compassion and nonviolence can overcome intolerance and oppression beautiful ideals to be associated with the olympic spirit
5943993 though you can stop people from speaking out you cant stop them from listening and thinking
5943994 are rallying together to denounce internet retailers that offer songs for tibet for purchase
5943995 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
5943996 the character of the work is solely artistic and not for profit without any commercial objective

5944002 das problem ist dass es wegen der finanzkrise derzeit sehr wenige gibt die sich die postbank leisten k nnen

5944037 in an increasingly competitive market in australia net prices have remained at last years level
5944038 without price improvement productivity initiatives were not sufficient to fully offset general inflationary cost pressures
5944039 the economic environment is uncertain and a changing competitive dynamic in the paint sector in australia will be further compounded by the introduction of imported paint by a major corporate retailer
5944040 given the changes that are occurring in the marketplace and the uncertain economic environment in which we are operating including no anticipated improvement in the housing sector it is too early to take a view on how the 2008 09 year will progress
5944041 if you eat things that grow near where you live its symbiotic
5944042 its healthier for you and i like to support local people local is important i wish there were more farms because its really sad to see them go

5944046 i like the idea of supporting local farms and eating healthy ive had the interest for a long time but now i can do it its a small town this has a different feel
5944047 its primarily that its healthier for us the food is fresher
5944048 nutrition is very important to me local products are better vegetables that travel across the country and sit on the shelves for a few days lose their freshness

5944052 i got into a taxi the driver instinctively put on the meter drove within the lanes and upon my paying the fare gave me my change and thanked me i knew i was experiencing something i had never experienced in my many prior visits to many other countries in the middle east and north africa this was the first of what has been a perpetual stream of dichotomies i have witnessed and experienced in tunisia that has allowed me to say that tunisia breaks the image that most people in the west have of the arab and muslim world we in the west particularly our present administration should look to tunisia as a country that while far from perfect can be a wonderful bridge between americans and the arab and muslim world and whose many achievements within the socio economic realm can be the barometer to which other countries in the region can aspire

5944061 and we have a growing contribution from our coal seam gas interests
5944062 revenues were down operating costs were up and interest costs were up so all of the key metrics were in the wrong direction
5944063 as a consequence there was an ebit reduction of 34 million from 46 6 million down to 12 4 million
5944064 we said we would strengthen the balance sheet we have
5944065 well be going in the same direction and over the same areas as weve done in previous budget bills starting with the first chapter on revenue projections
5944066 im not going to tell the military how it should get information
5944067 waterboarding doesnt kill them it makes them feel like drowning other than that the geneva convention works fine
5944068 my greatest hope is that my stories might lead readers to greater acceptance tolerance and compassion for one another
5944069 the leaders will discuss the post musharraf resignation issues including the election to the presidency
5944070 they are our important partners and played a critical role in our campaign for impeachment we have conceded to their demand
5944071 what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5944072 the biggest thing with heterogeneous grouping is that youre providing more challenges
5944073 quite honestly there are parents and teachers on different sides of that whole argument
5944074 our students are now kids the whole time we have them
5944075 with teaming were addressing problems before they become the big problem
5944076 we never refuse family and student motivation to participate in a higher level
5944077 but no matter what you call them youre labeling them
5944078 i dont want the top level students to essentially pay for the increases of the students at the bottom
5944079 i hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
5944080 i was very hesitant about getting back into local politics
5944081 theres plenty of time and campaigning really hasnt started yet
5944082 this device cannot find enough free resources that it can use
5944083 to test this idea the researchers showed 42 experienced tae kwon do referees video clips of sparring rounds of five different male competitors of similar abilities
5944084 de playstation 4 en xbox 720 zullen volgens ons in 2011 of 2012 al verschijnen
5944085 dat is slechts onze schatting we weten het niet en als we het al wisten dan zou het onder een nda non disclosure agreement vallen van zowel microsoft als sony
5944086 daarom denken we dat het al over vier jaar zal gebeuren al zouden er genoeg reden kunnen zijn dat het al eerder kan worden misschien 2010 we zullen zien
5944087 there is still a lot of work to do and this is the next step in getting the roads to someplace thats more of a maintenance role
5944088 this is the next step in getting the streets up to world class condition
5944089 it will be a challenge for the audit and finance commission and this board to pay down the bond
5944090 im a bit uncomfortable that perhaps theyre biting off more than they can chew
5944091 we obviously dont want to get ourselves into a situation where we are way over our heads
5944092 there are several issues both that the elgin families who filed the lawsuit have and we have here
5944093 we have complained for 20 plus years about our kids being bused all over the district about crowded classrooms and certainly we have had our share of mobile units our issues kind of parallel theirs
5944094 we would say that these things are happening because of the districts size
5944095 and to that point had the district been smaller and less bureaucratic many of those issues would not have arisen
5944096 its a districtwide issue the size of enrollment and the physical size of the district its almost impossible to meet everyones needs
5944097 theyve got a program its working well but its a large district and they feel that they have to treat everyone the same as a consequence where good programs arent the same you have to get rid of them the point is one size cant always fit all
5944098 it would be hard to imagine a scenario where bartlett disconnecting would not impact the rights of the 17 000 or more class members
5944099 the court at some level would have to review any attempt by bartlett or any other community to try to disconnect at this point
5944100 if youre looking to make good money in the online casinos field you need an internet presence and a great website
5944101 its unfortunate were talking about both these issues the same night
5944102 but we have to pass the pay ordinance 180 days before the election
5944103 i spend about a fifth of my week on village business
5944104 its time consuming im not recommending the position be full time but someday that may have to change
5944105 its the same thing for teachers too its a sea of children youve never seen before
5944106 every year what i do in my room it is from scratch
5944107 you need a lot of color and a lot up on the walls
5944108 we have everything else but we needed to bring a white sock and a ruler sized pencil box
5944109 we make sure that we carry the things from the local schools
5944110 were ready for the crunch when they cant find it anywhere else theyll be here at 9 p m

5944142 la maniobra del ejecutivo evita que el presidente comparezca en el congreso
5944143 el psoe compra a icv para evitar que zapatero d la cara en el congreso
5944144 zapatero promete a catalu a que tendr m s dinero antes de tres meses
5944145 situar en la agenda pol tica de europa el debate en torno a los derechos de los pueblos europeos entre ellos el vaso a realizar consultas

5944149 ha dejado ver bien a las claras su extrema debilidad pol tica al entablar negociaciones con un partido que tiene un solo diputado en la c mara
5944150 vuelve a supeditar los intereses generales del pa s a sus propias necesidades inmediatas y las de su partido
5944151 para evitarse molestias prefiere que las sufra solbes que es quien comparecer en el congreso y para intentar apagar las llamas del enfrentamiento diario de los socialistas catalanes con los del resto de espa a a cuenta de la financiaci n auton mica
5944152 ha solucionado su problema inmediato creando otro mayor que no s lo le afectar a l sino a todos
5944153 debe traducirse necesariamente en una ley y para ello es imprescindible que el resto de las autonom as lo acepte en el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera
5944154 ha adquirido un compromiso que puede no estar en condiciones de cumplir
5944155 ha logrado in extremis evitar que zapatero comparezca en el parlamento para rendir cuentas sobre la negociaci n de la financiaci n auton mica
5944156 el sistema parlamentario se ve burlado con este acto de ocultaci n del presidente del gobierno sustituido por su vicepresidente econ mico gracias a un pacto de conveniencia una mera componenda de pasillos a espaldas de la decencia democr tica con joan saura
5944157 es un golpe bajo al cr dito del sistema parlamentario cuyo principio fundamental es el control pol tico del ejecutivo
5944158 la debilidad pol tica de zapatero es el nutriente de partidos que van a encarecer sus esca os cada vez que el pp ponga al gobierno contra las cuerdas
5944159 todo cuanto tiene que ver con la pol tica territorial desarrollada por el jefe del ejecutivo y particularmente con catalu a es tratado desde la moncloa con opacidad y falta de valent a
5944160 ha supuesto un alivio para el ejecutivo pero tambi n para buena parte de la oposici n
5944161 no pod a ocultar su incomodidad por tener que coincidir con el pp cuyo objetivo es cuestionar la pol tica auton mica del psoe y no precisamente defender las posiciones catalanistas
5944162 han estado a punto de provocar un encontronazo institucional y pol tico que s lo beneficiaba al pp
5944163 aunque los partidos catalanistas pasan de puntillas sobre esta cuesti n lo cierto es que la negociaci n multilateral es legalmente inevitable y no es realista confiar en una alianza del gobierno y la generalitat y quiz baleares y valencia para sacar adelante un modelo con la oposici n del resto
5944164 la moncloa sortea el escollo de la comparecencia de zapatero y gana tiempo para poner el marcador de la negociaci n otra vez a cero tras el duro desencuentro de la semana pasada entre psoe y gobierno central de un lado y govern y psc del otro
5944165 se trata de un delicado encaje parlamentario que zapatero debe llevar a cabo para evitar el aislamiento del ejecutivo y a la postre una eventual pr rroga que pondr a en evidencia su falta de apoyos
5944166 han protagonizado una bajada pol tica de pantalones tan espectacular como pornogr fica
5944167 un m nimo de decencia democr tica exige que ambos dirigentes den una justificaci n de su cambio de actitud
5944168 se han burlado de sus votantes y han cometido fraude con sus electores catalanes
5944169 han rebajado el debate sobre la financiaci n de catalu a a un mero asunto t cnico y lo han despojado de su verdadero calado pol tico
5944170 tendr que poner sus cartas sobre la mesa y tomar una decisi n o asumir la negociaci n bilateral y pactar con montilla un modelo exclusivo como exige el estatut o acordar con las otras 15 regiones un modelo de financiaci n com n y satisfactorio para todas

5944174 acierta al lanzar un mensaje de firmeza en un momento delicado pero no es menos cierto que el gobierno afgano la otan y los pa ses que contribuyen con efectivos para retomar el control del pa s deber an plantearse una nueva estrategia a la vista de los acontecimientos
5944175 mientras occidente no mueve ficha afganist n vive sumido en una guerra sin perspectivas de soluci n
5944176 se refuerza el punto de vista de quienes entienden que el despliegue internacional no se corresponde con la degradaci n de las condiciones sobre el terreno
5944177 es de temer que el desaf o talib n gane en intensidad
5944178 que eso suceda s lo puede explicarse por graves errores en la estrategia pol tica y militar desarrollada por la otan y estados unidos
5944179 parece sugerir una voluntad de no conferir mayor relevancia de la aconsejable a un caso tan propenso a las interpretaciones interesadas o extempor neas

5944202 thats part of the position and you know that going in
5944203 youre seen as the leader of the team and the leader of the offense so when things arent going exactly right they look towards you and when things are going right they also look towards you
5944204 so its part of the job and you take it as you go
5944205 there are a lot of things going on and as the leader of the offense you want to go out and you want to perform
5944206 statistics are not always the tale of the tape you go and you watch the tape and you see what you did right and you see what you did wrong they dont always tell the story
5944207 i think thats what the offense is out here to do from the receivers to the line to the running backs everybody wants to go in and put points on the board
5944208 of course we take it personally we didnt have two great outings thus far and we want to go out and play well against the eagles
5944209 and we believe that if hes out there he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
5944210 if he happens to go down one of those other guys would have to step in and we have to have the confidence in them and they have to have the confidence in us just like tom

5944221 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
5944222 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
5944223 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality

5944229 team washington had nine players from lummi nation and two from yakima
5944230 this was the first team washington baseball team to play in the games now we would like to see other tribes get involved in baseball at the indigenous games
5944231 what a fabulous experience and what a great growth experience the games were for our players
5944232 the new brunswick game will always be my favorite memory
5944233 we were down 3 1 in the fifth winning and we put up seven runs in the sixth
5944234 our basketball players in the indigenous games were there cheering us on and the crowd was just going crazy ill never forget that
5944235 but we faced the same great pitcher in both games
5944236 one guy would pick up another such togetherness was a great pleasure they really came together as teammates it was most definitely a growing experience
5944237 helped me grow mentally so i can understand the mental side of the game so much better
5944238 my recovery never really had any setbacks it went pretty smooth i was able to do more and more each day and just got stronger and stronger and its continuing to do that
5944239 hopefully in the next couple of days well get comfortable with them again
5944240 its not a thing where having a week off is going to kill us with that we did it all summer and all spring so its just going to kind of be refreshing that and make sure were all on the same page heading into next week i was able to do a little bit last week throwing wise i tried to shake off some of the rust then but any time that youve taken some time off you have to work out a few things and well do that
5944241 it gives you a better look at what the skills of that individual are so that if you have that information its better to know the sooner we can figure out who that quarterback is what his strengths are then the better we can kind of pinpoint what we do and what we think will work
5944242 i just catch the ball and put it down i do it how the kickers like it
5944243 if he puts in down in the same spot the same way thats about all you can ask for
5944244 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
5944245 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
5944246 the history of the great events of this world are scarcely more than the history of crime
5944247 it does not appear that he had the technological sophistication to manufacture this super weapons grade anthrax which would have included aerosolization silicon coating and an electrostatic charge

5944250 huge huge he cant feel his legs hes got a bad heart hes been in and out of hospital with a heart attack just two weeks ago he has to carry his spray in his pocket just to spray under his tongue mr steiner said
5944251 so this could kill him to be dragged away from his family and friends and his home
5944252 this is home he made a commitment to become an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him as a citizen as well
5944253 so badly that he died from his injuries late that evening
5944254 i saw three brown dogs having a feed of this bloke they were down on the inside of his legs
5944255 he was there lying on the ground i hunted those dogs i threw rocks at them and yelled at them to get away from the man
5944256 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000
5944257 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
5944258 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
5944259 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday
5944260 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multicolour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
5944261 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5944262 sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems and are especially vulnerable to overfishing and yet currently there are few effective controls on fishing or trade
5944263 theres no doubt that sharks are a very important part of our marine ecosystems while theyre not necessarily popular they are a important part of the food chain and we need to make sure that their populations are maintained
5944264 huge huge he cant feel his legs hes got a bad heart hes been in and out of hospital with a heart attack just two weeks ago he has to carry his spray in his pocket just to spray under his tongue mr steiner said
5944265 so this could kill him to be dragged away from his family and friends and his home
5944266 this is home he made a commitment to become an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him as a citizen as well
5944267 so badly that he died from his injuries late that evening
5944268 the challenge facing us is pretty realistic in terms of the difficulties soldiers are facing in the battlefield today what we needed was a system that could look high and low and present as complete a picture of the environment as possible
5944269 combining the autonomous ground vehicle with the small uav and the blimp has enabled us to do just that and we are very confident that the technologies weve used will meet the demands of the challenge
5944270 we have a long standing relationship with mira which has been instrumental in helping us develop and test autonomous technologies effectively we are extremely pleased to be supporting their grand challenge entry and believe the team has devised an elegant solution capable of performing well at copehill down
5944271 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5944272 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5944273 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5944274 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5944275 the shit that happened to my children im going to get each and everyone of youse f kers back
5944276 my children are having nightmares and each and every person is going to suffer the same shit
5944277 if i see you come near my house again im going to f king shoot you
5944278 im not going to be taken lightly you know who this is
5944279 the cover tenders were requested from the fire brigades its a bodgy price to make up the numbers
5944280 so youre telling me the fire brigade is telling you to create as you put it in your words bodgy tenders
5944281 yes thats what my understanding of what a cover price is
5944282 one of three things can happen its mother comes back its adopted by another pod or if we rear it in captivity
5944283 owners who give various reasons why the tenant cannot inspect the property but still asks them to provide an upfront rent or deposit payment
5944284 too good to be true offers claims the property can only be secured by an upfront fee via a money transfer and ongoing excuses why an inspection cant take place
5944285 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5944286 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5944287 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5944288 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5944289 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5944290 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5944291 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5944292 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5944293 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5944294 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5944295 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5944296 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5944297 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5944298 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5944299 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5944300 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5944301 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5944302 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5944303 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5944304 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5944305 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5944306 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5944307 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5944308 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5944309 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5944310 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5944311 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5944312 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5944313 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5944314 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5944315 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5944316 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5944317 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5944318 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
5944319 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5944320 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5944321 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5944322 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5944323 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there

5944326 we all want to cause spammers pain none of the current classifiers are capable of causing the spammers any pain because the spammer is long gone by the time the classifier has the opportunity to process the message what we need is a way to use the classifier against the spammer while the spammer is still connected

5944331 behalve dat dit voor ons gezin een leerzame ervaring is kunnen we hiermee ook aandacht vragen voor de voedselbank
5944332 voor mensen in zulke omstandigheden kun je alleen maar respect opbrengen
5944333 ik vind het van ren en zijn gezin zeer moedig dat ze aan dit programma deelnemen en zich hiermee kwetsbaar durven opstellen
5944334 er gaat van alles gebeuren er zijn al heel veel mensen die hebben toegezegd we hebben een aantal mensen gevraagd of ze alsjeblieft wilden komen sinterklaas komt sowies en nog meer gasten maar dat vertel ik later wel ook zijn er ontzettend veel wensen en idee n
5944335 the development of the real estate has good prospects in a relatively long term after rational adjustment it will show a more sound development trend
5944336 its a great way to continue a benefit for people whove worked hard for our community
5944337 the last thing we want is to be forced like gm to cut off our retirees
5944338 i would enroll my own parents in this its that good
5944339 its comparable or enhanced coverage depending on what plan retirees had before
5944340 what stopped it until now i think is mostly the fear that people would get less coverage than they currently have and thats really not the case
5944341 were trying to find out whats best for us and best for them
5944342 we dont have any intention of leaving them out of the loop
5944343 we do plan to increase both our level of investment in asia and the number of funds focused on the region
5944344 a portion of these investments will flow to japan and other mature markets but the majority will target emerging asia particularly china and india
5944345 in many cases their current level of asian property investment is below their current target and we see clients increasing their target allocations to asia as well
5944346 consumers need real protections against unscrupulous builders who build shoddy homes and the trcc has never provided homeowners with that kind of protection
5944347 we were created to help consumers and builders and remodelers to resolve differences thats what weve been doing
5944348 was never meant to be a true regulatory agency with a clear mission of protecting the public
5944349 still has no real power to require builders to make needed repairs
5944350 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5944351 we need a call to action not a call to go to another conference
5944352 hot inflation and cool housing leaves the fomc stuck in neutral for now
5944353 given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward it is likely that businesses will have increasing difficulty raising prices to consumers
5944354 microsoft was a patent hawk client for years they had every opportunity for friendly sic discussion the words patent tax were used and microsoft chose a path consistent with their corporate culture
5944355 part of this is due to the fact that new home construction is down and both new and existing inventories remain at pretty good levels unlike some areas of the country that have seen inventories spike
5944356 job creation affects all prices ranges from ceos down to joe janitor
5944357 with the recent sharp escalations in food and energy prices coupled with overall gloomy news on the national economy many potential buyers see little urgency to purchase a home in the current market
5944358 im going to stay here all night because i have already turned in the rental car and without the car we have no where else to go so were here
5944359 they tell us nothing nothing and that is not good for us but later we talked with them and they are i think trying to book a new flight on united

5944369 the reformer is always right about what is wrong he is generally wrong about what is right

5944378 this will be the last race of my career and ive thought of nothing else for two years
5944379 reasons for defending marriage between a man and a woman as an issue of moral imperative
5944380 marriage is not primarily a contract between individuals to ratify their affections and provide for mutual obligations rather marriage and family are vital instruments for rearing children and teaching them to become responsible adults
5944381 tolerance as a gospel principle means love and forgiveness of one another not tolerating transgression the church does not condone abusive treatment of others and encourages its members to treat all people with respect however speaking out against practices with which the church disagrees on moral grounds including same sex marriage does not constitute abuse or the frequently misused term hate speech we can express genuine love and friendship for the homosexual family member or friend without accepting the practice of homosexuality or any re definition of marriage
5944382 legalizing same sex marriage will affect a wide spectrum of government activities and policies
5944383 marriage is fundamentally an unselfish act legally protected because only a male and female together can create new life and because the rearing of children requires a life long commitment which marriage is intended to provide societal recognition of same sex marriage cannot be justified simply on the grounds that it provides self fulfillment to its partners for it is not the purpose of government to provide legal protection to every possible way in which individuals may pursue fulfillment by definition all same sex unions are infertile and two individuals of the same gender whatever their affections can never form a marriage devoted to raising their own mutual offspring
5944384 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints has chosen to become involved along with many other churches organizations and individuals in defending the the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman because it is a compelling moral issue of profound importance to our religion and to the future of our society
5944385 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5944386 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5944387 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5944388 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5944389 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5944390 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5944391 taking on the system rules for radical change in a digital era kos is quoted there was an assumption by the powers that be that the rest of the citizen body couldnt think for ourselves that we needed self appointed and so called experts to tell us what to think what to do and what we should or should not know for far too long these gatekeepers controlled the national conversation
5944392 the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5944393 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5944394 as you are aware there has been a significant sale of shares in an unrelated company tower australia which may have led to some speculation in the marketplace we are not aware of any other explanation for the price change you have noted
5944395 we were looking for new materials for corneal tissue replacement and this led to observations of the optical properties of silk and its ability to replicate optical components with nanopatterned features
5944396 the most compelling feature is that the components are prepared processed and optimized all in aqueous environments and at ambient temperature which offers the opportunity to include biological receptors such as proteins and enzymes
5944397 we can produce sophisticated optical elements in a pure protein that preserve the biochemical activity of the embedded bio dopants

5944403 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina

5944409 with our production house doing well as an actor i dont have to be desperate im not so ambitious as to put my whole and soul into an acting career i can do solo hero films but id rather be part of bigger projects with salmanbhai that will have a smooth sailing release as a producer i know which projects will make it smoothly
5944410 yash tonk was originally doing my role he even shot for four days then he got busy with his television work
5944411 yash is a friend we did fight club together it was an awkward situation for him he called me up and requested me to get into his shoes since it was salmanbhais film i didnt think twice
5944412 its my first raw and real film and my punjabi is very scratchy i had to polish it up before i could face the camera i like wearing different hats especially for my brothers
5944413 in kissan arbaaz and i play hardcore farmers in dhotis i had never worn a dhoti before its the most authentic production weve ever done its about the new generation of farmers not valuing their land
5944414 jackie shroff plays our father we shot in chandigarh for 40 days at a stretch then i left for melbourne for main aur mrs khanna quite a culture shock now we go into partner 2 where i dont have an acting part
5944415 its basically a brand name now and salmanbhai and govinda are part of that brand govinda keeps embarrassing us by praising bhai and me all the time
5944416 theres no hassle no sense of one upmanship no double hero ego problems and we share a great chemistry so producers like signing us together i was never supposed to be in salaam e ishq my track was added much later it had nothing to do with salmanbhai
5944417 im very happy with the acting work that i do acting is only a part of my life i want to produce give time to my wife and son and spend time with my friends i want to do quality work
5944418 and well continue to introduce new talent like prem soni whos directing main aur mrs khanna for us my hands are full till 2010 and im a producer first an actor later
5944419 akshay kumar is an inspiration for me he has handled his career beautifully im envious of him
5944420 akshay ventured into a completely different arena that is comedy and he was widely appreciated for it my bond has especially grown with him post hera pheri
5944421 im my biggest critic whenever i go out with my friends to watch my film i keep looking for flaws i look critically the way i look in the film or the way i act
5944422 my friends keep telling me to shut up and stop criticising myself but i never stop they are so sweet that they tell me to just watch my films and enjoy them
5944423 many of the tactics and even some of the same organizations and actors used by exxon mobil to mislead the public draw upon the tobacco industrys 40 year disinformation campaign
5944424 which had been covertly created by the tobacco company philip morris in 1993 to manufacture uncertainty about the health hazards posed by secondhand smoke
5944425 if you live anywhere in this cone of concern one said of the projected path

5944430 mr inman has always been very clear to me that his wish is to receive death
5944431 did not want to talk about the sex part but i did have sex with her
5944432 my mother was not only a good worker who never let any adversity get her down but she was also a happy and fun loving woman who people liked
5944433 she was always on the go and thats why she loved living in mckeesport with its mills churches and busy shopping areas
5944434 mom fit in wherever she went whether it was at the restaurant her church or at a bingo game
5944435 it was a fairly big restaurant that not only catered to the men and women who worked at u s steels national tube but the various businesses
5944436 and on busy days mom would also go out on the floor and wait on customers
5944437 my mother would take them for long bus rides and on picnics she even took my children to disney world in florida
5944438 she was known for her easter pascha her ice box cookies and her chicken noodle soup my mother also enjoyed crocheting and creating numerous crafts that she sold

5944448 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5944449 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5944450 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5944451 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5944452 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5944453 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy
5944454 since only the non executive cadre would be striking we dont expect any major disruption in the airports operation however we are ready with a contingency plan to deal with any eventuality
5944455 we have decided to join the strike call because we think the government is dealing with our demands in a very casual manner
5944456 we two countries should solve this issue by peaceful means and avoid war
5944457 when the situation is normal in preah vihear then we will think about reopening the border
5944458 some of us are given genetically stretchy skin but a lot arent the good news is they dont look like red crayon marks forever they fade
5944459 sometimes we have a sense that everyone has a perfect life and is wearing jeans after six weeks and whoever made that up is lying
5944460 if youre really depressed maybe see a therapist it might be post partum depression it might be about more than just stretch marks once youre feeling better you wont fixate on those
5944461 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5944462 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy the identification of a stem cell line with o negative blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
5944463 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
5944464 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5944465 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5944466 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5944467 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5944468 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5944469 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5944470 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individual s level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
5944471 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5944472 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond one s level of performance on each test alone
5944473 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
5944474 this figure is in line with what we d expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
5944475 the defendant has been observed walking up and down the parking lot of the park del mar apartments complex in tampa wearing his uniform and carrying a ceremonial sword apparently practicing parade drills

5944483 we will not allow the kurdish peoples achievements to be wrecked by the iraqi parliament iraq will fall apart if the constitution is violated
5944484 it is tense in kirkuk quite frankly it is tense because of the debate over the elections and thats just something that the iraqi people will have to work out among themselves but i have confidence that they will in a peaceful means as long as some of the people dont flare it up with false reporting
5944485 kirkuk is a minefield if we touch it and try to solve the problem it will blow up if we continue ignoring and delaying it it will also eventually blow up
5944486 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may effect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5944501 i hope the london bus will be a new symbol of shimonoseki
5944502 at first i wondered if the london bus would suit the city but now i can tell its well suited to the retro look of the city
5944503 the london bus has become very popular as a means of transport for both tourists and local citizens
5944504 the bus was tough to drive because it has its own style
5944505 the steering wheel is heavy and vibration can be felt on rough roads
5944506 but driving the london bus is a lot of fun as people wave their hands to us with a big smile which had never happened before in my career
5944507 it was so scary as the roof is high so the balance can shift really easily but im used to it i hope it will top the tourists list in shimonoseki
5944508 every time we play these guys its never an easy win
5944509 you do a job like that and give up only two runs thats giving your team a good effort

5944522 we really trained and he made some great advances as far as defending his legs but he fundora is one of the best leg attackers in the world he kind of broke down our defense and thats why he advanced and we didnt
5944523 ben is young and this is the first time hes made a world team or an olympic team
5944524 we talked about that and i said lets not worry about what might happen or who you might wrestle next lets wrestle this match
5944525 theres a lot more competitions ahead of us hes a young guy and he has the opportunity to make two or three more olympic games
5944526 we got pitches we could do something with and had some big hits
5944527 were going to have to gut it out we either turn it around or its going to be a long month and a half

5944536 given the current legislature there isnt anything anyone can do about it
5944537 do you support boobs on bikes coming to wellington and why
5944538 yes i dont think its offensive if people have such a problem with it then they wouldnt go
5944539 i dont know i cant see why youd want to bare your boobs on a bike in the middle of winter
5944540 yes a lot of women politicians say it should stop but men can go topless and women cant its not really equality then is it its just a pair of boobs theyre overreacting
5944541 no its an auckland event its tied into a series of business promotions that steve crow is doing that has no relevance to wellington there is no need
5944542 yes id support anything that doesnt harm other human beings the world needs to stop judging and just being jealous either join them or ignore them
5944543 yes sounds good to me i dont mind a bit im all for it
5944544 yes if i want to take my top off and walk down the street i should be allowed to

5944551 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
5944552 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cell phones
5944553 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5944554 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5944555 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11 nine eleven needs to be a day that is forever preserved as a day of unity and day of remembrance and day of compassion when we put aside our differences and we think about how we can help others in need
5944556 when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and at that age its enough to hold them as they grow up they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away they believe the rope can still hold them so they never try to break free

5944578 youre one of those people arent you let me see if i can explain this in words you understand
5944579 theres this search engine called google you have to make google happy or it wont send you traffic without traffic no one will ever find you so its all that matters

5944582 do you like it its optimized for every species of whale and all related sea creatures and the keyword density is fantastic
5944583 but its all wrong youve drained its soul with your cheap hacks
5944584 but some of these keywords arent even relevant whats with this make money whaling alaska bit my book has nothing to do with making money or alaska
5944585 well it needs to my keyword research revealed that make money whaling alaska gets plenty of searches and has surprisingly little competition youll need to rewrite your entire book around that keyword so you get the 1 spot on google
5944586 but if we did what you say it takes to be found no one would want to read it
5944587 thats ok because you can make money from these adsense ads take a look

5944592 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5944593 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5944594 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5944595 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush

5944598 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000
5944599 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
5944600 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
5944601 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday
5944602 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multicolour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
5944603 i saw three brown dogs having a feed of this bloke they were down on the inside of his legs
5944604 he was there lying on the ground i hunted those dogs i threw rocks at them and yelled at them to get away from the man
5944605 obviously some of that is oil but the reality of it is that is a lot
5944606 i think this is the bottom of the days range
5944607 its a great way to continue a benefit for people whove worked hard for our community
5944608 the last thing we want is to be forced like gm to cut off our retirees
5944609 i would enroll my own parents in this its that good
5944610 its comparable or enhanced coverage depending on what plan retirees had before
5944611 what stopped it until now i think is mostly the fear that people would get less coverage than they currently have and thats really not the case
5944612 were trying to find out whats best for us and best for them
5944613 we dont have any intention of leaving them out of the loop
5944614 owners who give various reasons why the tenant cannot inspect the property but still asks them to provide an upfront rent or deposit payment
5944615 too good to be true offers claims the property can only be secured by an upfront fee via a money transfer and ongoing excuses why an inspection cant take place

5944619 i dont know if its as off the wall as an awful lot of stuff thats out there
5944620 ozawas stuff is so off the wall hardcore it makes you wonder if she owes the wrong people money

5944622 huge huge he cant feel his legs hes got a bad heart hes been in and out of hospital with a heart attack just two weeks ago he has to carry his spray in his pocket just to spray under his tongue mr steiner said
5944623 so this could kill him to be dragged away from his family and friends and his home
5944624 this is home he made a commitment to become an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him as a citizen as well
5944625 so badly that he died from his injuries late that evening
5944626 its one thing to swing a club its another to play golf
5944627 a good player needs to be able to work the ball in both directions
5944628 shaping shots is one of the most exciting aspects of creating a golf game
5944629 nothing beats hitting a long tiger like slinger that runs an extra 15 yards down the fairway or hitting a little soft floating fade into an impossible pin location and see the ball check up in a blink
5944630 so much about your ball flight can be dictated by your grip and posture
5944631 you might see someone with a strong grip both hands on the club handle turned more to the right and a forward hip tilt that allows a good turn with a shallow angle of approach to the ball one who draws the ball easily based on their physical makeup and range of motion
5944632 conversely you might see someone with a weak grip both hands turned more to the left and posture that is a bit more upright still allowing an adequate turn with a steeper angle of approach to the ball one who fades the ball easily again based on their physical makeup and range of motion
5944633 both ball flights are terrific and golfers should be who they are based on some of these very things
5944634 the draw tends to hold its line better in the wind and the distance isnt as adversely affected
5944635 the method i have the most success teaching is to advise a student to aim their club face where they want the shot to finish and aim their body the way they want it to start
5944636 byron nelson told me when the pin is tucked in the right corner never aim at the pin
5944637 start out to the center of the green and let it slide to the right
5944638 the biggest advantages to hitting a draw are that the ball will roll farther and vice versa the fade will stop quicker
5944639 strong people who can keep the ball in the air a long time dont need roll and should stay away from a hook however a senior who hits the ball very short in the air can use the extra roll
5944640 if a player who comes to me is a big slicer the first thing i do is get him to start hitting draws with a short iron off of a tee
5944641 i do this by moving his ball position well back so to get his body in front of the ball at impact
5944642 ill use a reflector stick place it 10 yards or so in front of the student and pretend it is a tree
5944643 we will then practice curving the shot around to the left and right of the stick
5944644 it is all about getting the student to understand and feel where the club face is throughout the impact zone
5944645 the commission of the andean community has just approved decision 689 allowing members countries to adequate certain provisions of decision 486 common regulations on industrial property granting rights to each country member of the andean community bolivia colombia ecuador and peru to strengthen protection of industrial property rights through internal legislation decision 689 incorporates the following provisions 1 by introducing an exception to article 9 it allows countries to establish conditions to reinstate priority rights on a patent or utility model industrial design or trademark for a term not more than two months beyond the established initial period 2 it allows amendment of article 28 to introduce additional regulations related to divulgation of the invention in sense of requiring applicant greater clarity in the description and sufficiency in such divulgation so that there is no need for a person having knowledge of the state of the art to conduct undue experimentation 3 it clarifies article 34 by establishing that reporting on omissions on the spanish text of description and claims will not be considered an extension of the invention if the new matter was contained in the priority application if claimed 4 except in the case of patents for pharmaceutical products and processes it grants rights to member countries to compensate for undue delays in the grant of the patents undue delays being those delays exceeding five years from filing date or three years from the date a petition for examination was filed and where such delays can only be attributable to the patent office 5 it clarifies article 53 allowing countries to pass new legislation limiting patentees rights creating a provision equal to the bolar exception 6 it revises article 138 by letting countries approve a multiclass trademark registration system 7 it enables countries to implement article 140 of decision 486 by fixing specific terms to satisfy the formalities detailed in it without loss of filing rights 8 it allows an exception to article 162 of decision 486 now countries may decide that recordal of a license agreement be optional 9 it clarifies article 202 of decision 486 now an indication of origin will not be protected if it may be confused with i a registered mark or with a mark subject to registration provided the mark has been registered in good faith or with ii a famous mark 10 it allows the countries to implement legislation on border measures in connection with trademark rights the new legislation establishes that by 20 august 2008 the countries members which wish to exercise this option must inform the secretary general of the andean community that they will proceed peru having already passed new legislation in line with the new decision will exercise this right as of 1 january 2009
5944646 industrial action is looming we have been very disappointed with the quality of negotiations today and wed urge the state government to come back to the table with a new and improved offer
5944647 the state government has told us that their offer is a package deal
5944648 the offer of 9 75 per cent and the new student centred funding model for our schools remain on the table and frankly our members have rejected this
5944649 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5944650 sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems and are especially vulnerable to overfishing and yet currently there are few effective controls on fishing or trade
5944651 theres no doubt that sharks are a very important part of our marine ecosystems while theyre not necessarily popular they are a important part of the food chain and we need to make sure that their populations are maintained
5944652 we need to start collectively thinking together how to resolve these issues not just by raising the fare
5944653 thats a very easy thing to do but its the wrong thing to do
5944654 the way to do things right now is not to start talking about fare increases a year out but to really look at every single possible solution
5944655 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5944656 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5944657 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5944658 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5944659 i wanted to create a site filled with first hand experience and guidance from parents and coaches who have been through all of the stages of tennis player development themselves
5944660 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5944661 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5944662 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5944663 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5944664 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5944665 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5944666 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5944667 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5944668 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5944669 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5944670 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5944671 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5944672 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5944673 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5944674 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5944675 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5944676 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5944677 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5944678 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5944679 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5944680 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5944681 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5944682 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5944683 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5944684 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5944685 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5944686 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5944687 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5944688 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5944689 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5944690 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
5944691 a m me escandaliza que la subcomisi n de acusaciones constitucionales est en manos del fujimorismo entend moslo los fujimoristas que est n en el congreso son defensores de un delincuente ese se or alberto fujimori ya fue declarado delincuente ha sido condenado por uno de los delitos usurpaci n de funciones en el caso allanamiento en el poder judicial
5944692 quien defiende a un corrupto es un corrupto seamos claros mientras no seamos claros el pa s no va a cambiar y la gente no quiere que se generalice la corrupci n esto debe llamar a reflexi n porque tienen que darse cuenta que tienen que dar un golpe de tim n y que con los corruptos no se puede ir ni a misa como dice el refr n
5944693 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5944694 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5944695 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5944696 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5944697 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5944698 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5944699 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5944700 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5944701 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5944702 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5944703 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5944704 this is going to set the precedence of how we handle these cases from here on out
5944705 how much confusion will this cause years from now there cant be two headstones
5944706 media reports have suggested mr green could step aside as early as this week
5944707 the company is aware of ongoing media speculation relating to management and board changes
5944708 while no decision has been made a subcommittee of the companys board is meeting on the morning of thursday 21 august 2008 when necessary information is available to them to consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
5944709 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5944710 this is a consequence of macmahons share price falling 16 8 per cent over this period and reflects the uncertain value of macmahons shares
5944711 the board is pleased that macmahons offer is now final so that shareholders can reject it and ausdrill can continue to capitalise upon its outstanding growth opportunities in australia and africa for the benefit of our shareholders
5944712 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5944713 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5944714 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5944715 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5944716 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5944717 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5944718 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5944719 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5944720 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5944721 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5944722 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5944723 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5944724 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5944725 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5944726 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5944727 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5944728 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5944729 who are open to doing something on the production side
5944730 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5944731 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5944732 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5944733 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5944734 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5944735 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5944736 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5944737 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5944738 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5944739 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5944740 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5944741 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5944742 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5944743 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5944744 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5944745 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5944746 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5944747 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5944748 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5944749 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5944750 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5944751 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5944789 today many mothers in kyrgyzstan do not go in for exclusive breastfeeding of babies under six months old besides their breast milk they give cows milk tea with milk kefir fermented cows milk or food from the family table to their babies
5944790 medics are concerned by the proliferation of various artificial baby milk formula products and breastfeeding is being displaced
5944791 we are grateful to parliamentarians unicef and doctors for raising this issue and for the drafting of a bill that will help our women and children
5944792 there is a demographic crisis in the country birth rates are not increasing and we need to adopt this law it is the first time we have discussed the bill with the civil sector and donors i think its adoption could help improve the situation
5944793 breast milk substitutes are being imported into kyrgyzstan from 15 countries
5944794 but i know that many mothers give baby formula to their children because there is a general opinion that it is healthy even some doctors say that
5944795 formula milk manufacturers are interested in quick sales and even work with medical organisations

5944811 its heartwrenching this we thought was an answer to a mystery thats been going on for far too long the best term i can use is it was heartbreaking literally
5944812 its heartbreaking really we dont want to work and live in fear but when things like this happen just a couple of blocks down the street it hits us pretty hard
5944813 were a bit more careful about where we eat and the time we eat but well still come out here

5944825 the last half of august is really going to tell a tale
5944826 last year even though prices were relatively high people seemed to continue to vacation using their cars
5944827 because for a family of four thats still the cheapest way to go
5944828 just because were dropping back down to the 3 50 range i dont think people are going to let up anytime soon
5944829 it will take something more substantial to get people to reverse their behavior
5944830 were just worried that hes going to come back how can a man who did all of this be out of jail i dont know where he is
5944831 i think the judge took those things into consideration when i asked for a higher bond
5944832 a judge can order whatever the judge wants to order
5944833 but its a better practice i think for a judge to do what the law requires in the first place than to bend the rules and make the defendant go to the court of appeals to straighten things out
5944834 this is a tragedy that affects two families and it will be a very difficult situation
5944835 he regrets the situation quite a bit but that does not necessarily mean that he is guilty of any crime at this time
5944836 she would always tell us when we were kids if you want to be an astronaut you can be an astronaut doctor you can be a doctor president

5944869 this is completely different than doing anything in normal artillery
5944870 talking to longbow apache helicopter pilots is different than anything else in the artillery branch i have to take into consideration air to ground integration and put myself into the pilots position i have to create a clear picture in their minds before they can attack the enemy
5944871 its great having him because he has training related to artillery rounds
5944872 it helps to have someone who has more knowledge and he can pass it down to my other soldiers as well
5944873 hes extended his time in the army so we know hes committed to doing what hes here for
5944874 well positioned for future growth with a strong balance sheet combined with a portfolio of high quality operating and project assets
5944875 group mineral resources are estimated at 70 6 million ounces of gold and 9 18 million tonnes of copper
5944876 this represents a year on year increase for gold of 28 or 15 4 million ounces and increase for copper of 62 or 3 53 million tonnes
5944877 group ore reserves are estimated at 40 0 million ounces of gold and 4 15 million tonnes of copper
5944878 this represents a year on year increase for gold of 20 or 6 8 million ounces and increase for copper of 54 or 1 45 million tonnes
5944879 the result follows the successful merger with equigold nl completed in june which brings to the lgl group the well established mt rawdon gold mine in queensland and the bonikro operation in ivory coast
5944880 bonikro is now in commissioning with the first gold pour scheduled for september
5944881 it is forecast to produce approximately 50 60 000 ounces in the current year while mt rawdon should contribute approximately 50 000 ounces including 5 100 ounces in the first half
5944882 in addition to the new equigold assets lgls second half production will benefit from the start of commercial gold production at ballarat
5944883 ore extraction is set to begin this month with mining of the first stope and will ramp up over the remainder of the year ballarat is expected to produce approximately 40 50 000 ounces in 2008 with the bulk of production in the final quarter
5944884 the lgl groups major asset the 23 million ounce reserve lihir island mine continues to perform well and is scheduled to produce more than 700 000 ounces this year following output of 308 000 ounces in the first half
5944885 the expansion of the process plant to lift output to more than 1 million ounces per year continued to make good progress in the first half and remains on budget and on schedule for completion in 2011
5944886 by the end of this year the lgl group will have four mines in operation producing a total of more than 1 2 million ounces of gold per year providing the company with diversified cashflows and strong future growth potential
5944887 the improved profit performance reported for the first half of 2008 confirms the companys robust financial position and reflects a range of operational enhancements implemented over the past two years
5944888 gold production for the half year totalled 316 000 ounces including 6 800 ounces from mt rawdon and kirkalocka
5944889 this was lower than the prior december half output of 325 000 ounces due primarily to lower gold grades and planned plant maintenance shutdowns at the lihir island operation
5944890 lihir island production at 308 000 ounces was in line with budget for the half
5944891 process plant throughput was at record levels in the half despite a 17 day total plant shutdown for scheduled maintenance in the first quarter
5944892 the december half has started with significant volatility in the gold price however conditions in the gold sector and in the global economy in general remain conducive to a firm gold price
5944893 gold demand continues to trend higher and supply remains under pressure due to lack of new discoveries and rising production costs
5944894 while the gold price has eased to around the 800 mark we have simultaneously seen reductions in oil prices and a strengthening in the us dollar which should help to alleviate cost pressures and sustain margins
5944895 for the full year i remain confident of reporting a solid improvement in operating cash flows and net profit after tax
5944896 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
5944897 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok

5944899 its important for the people of florida to know the citizen soldiers and airmen of the florida national guard are prepared to respond to tropical storm fay as assigned by the florida division of emergency management
5944900 the national guard is poised to provide humanitarian aid security equipment debris removal and search and rescue assistance
5944901 the guard has continuous contact and coordination in effect with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and has established planning cells to ensure a rapid build up of personnel and equipment if needed
5944902 we have much experience in responding to emergencies and we will continue to rise to the occasion
5944903 all this is done in support of the civil authorities
5944904 we get our tasking from the state through the national guard emergency operations center those missions could be anything from traffic control around one of the points of distribution to using a forklift to move commodities
5944905 one contingency is that the main storm hits in naples fort myers area the second contingency is that the storm hits tampa and the third contingency is that it goes up the coast gains some speed and hits the panhandle
5944906 obviously if we have soldiers in the affected areas we dont want to pull them into state active duty because they have their families to be concerned about
5944907 every time we have a disaster relief effort its a new ball game
5944908 you dont know what roads are going to be open or what facilities are going to be available its like setting up in brand new war zone every time

5945049 john hanger has been at the forefront of nearly all environmental policy discussions in pennsylvania for the past two decades
5945050 he has been working to keep our energy costs down and increase our access to clean renewable fuels for our cars and energy for our homes in one way or another since 1988
5945051 his reputation as one of the states leading environmental voices and his experience and relationships here in harrisburg with legislators stakeholders and the administration will prove to be a valuable asset as we work to make a better cleaner and healthier pennsylvania for our 12 4 million residents
5945052 i urge the senate to act promptly and confirm his nomination
5945053 with john hangers strong background on energy issues through his work on the puc and with pennfuture we will expect energy to be front and center during his tenure as dep secretary
5945054 when i would disagree with him instead of making logical arguments to change my mind he would say i was in the pocket of the polluters that i take money from polluters and thats why i vote this way
5945055 that doesnt get a dialogue going its offensive you can say im wrong or you can say im stupid but dont say im corrupt

5945061 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
5945062 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
5945063 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
5945064 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
5945065 we would get things almost every day from people all over the country
5945066 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
5945067 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people
5945068 there is just so much these days with the internet and web sites and blogs but this was a story about a kid who was just so real that it grabs you
5945069 i know pittsburgh is probably all concerned about what the steelers are going to be like this fall and how maybe the penguins couldve done things differently in the stanley cup but this kids story was just so different

5945073 i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here
5945074 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
5945075 he said he just wanted to meet john coach maddon has really become touched by john and his message
5945076 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
5945077 now john had no idea about these madonna and a rod rumors about an affair and john goes so wheres your wife i couldnt believe it but a rod just said she was in florida at their other home with their kids
5945078 then john asked him if his wife worked john wasnt trying to be smart he was just curious he told john that she didnt work but that she had a psychology degree
5945079 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
5945080 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
5945081 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
5945082 if i can help someone else going through this then that would make me feel good
5945083 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is

5945179 well i put my fastball where i wanted and everything else happened
5945180 absolutely his velocity was better than that game and he was making good hitters look uncomfortable which is a great sign it was ital by far end ital his best start hes been building toward this and hopefully he can maintain some of it
5945181 its just slowly getting healthy slowly getting back to myself
5945182 it feels good to have my velocity back and not getting scared away from hitters i challenged all of them tonight no matter who it was i think i threw more fastballs than i had all year
5945183 it was fun going against a great hitter like that

5945220 theyre going to obviously see some impact from the rising dollar this is going to influence their overseas revenue and will have some impact on their bottom line
5945221 this pushes out the wall of worry for tech investors until another 90 days
5945222 it looks like results are going to be close to normal for these two groups
5945223 it is not to say nobody is concerned about these things there is tremendous concern
5945224 i had a hard time finding a baby sling that worked for me so i started coming up with a hybrid then it occurred to me that i couldnt pull it off by myself
5945225 thats when the other kristin came in weve been friends for years
5945226 we have some cash flow from sales our marketing expenses include giving away slings to blogs and magazines that provide pr as well as to celebrities and other individuals who provide word of mouth advertising
5945227 were really focused on natural living eating organic buying organic fabrics
5945228 we did research for about six to eight months trying to find out where we could source fabrics and who could we contract with to do the pattern design
5945229 we wanted to keep it sustainable and green we print on recycled paper our boxes that the sling comes in are compostable we wanted to be as eco friendly as we possibly could were still working toward that every day
5945230 we have a huge focus on the community creating jobs in asheville
5945231 everybody seems to be looking for environmentally responsible socially responsible companies
5945232 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5945233 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5945234 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5945235 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5945236 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5945237 its only the little people who have problems that money and stardom cant solve

5945255 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
5945256 in a muslim country where the numbers of women wearing the veil are rising and so by most accounts are incidents of groping and catcalls in the streets the message in ads circulating anonymously in e mails here in egypt is clear
5945257 zuhair mohammed a 60 year old shopper on the same street said she long ago stopped wearing the traditional islamic covering in part for that reason
5945258 i feel like with the hijab it makes them wonder what are you hiding underneath
5945259 the more women veil the less men learn to behave as decent and civilized members of society
5945260 and the more women are harassed the more they veil thinking it will protect them
5945261 among egyptian women 72 percent of those who described incidents of harassment said they were veiled at the time
5945262 if you cover up you are hiding your body and drawing attention to your femaleness
5945263 the push toward electronic medical records has made storing personal health information in a locked filing cabinet in your doctors office an outmoded guarantee of confidentiality today patients can gather their jumbled health information hospital visits drug prescriptions and health insurance plans and manage them through a number of different online services including google health microsofts healthvault and aol co founder steve cases revolution health
5945264 what a summer its been a veritable harvest of legislative progress appears to have been made by the true farmers of america our elected representatives the seeds of change have been skillfully planted and by the time rainy season comes this november the legislative fruits of innovation in health it should just be ripening
5945265 federal efforts to promote health information technology are too focused on standards without considering long term medical outcomes goals according to the authors of an article published today on the
5945266 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army
5945267 deale was previously with aston villa and we had to fight off a lot of clubs to bring him here thankfully he chose the right club in liverpool our goalkeeping coach billy stewart rates him very highly so hopefully he can do well for us this season
5945268 if i could go and buy a good right winger now i would do if i had the money i would buy shaun wright phillips but thats out of the question now i havent got that sort of money
5945269 so ill try to go and find someone like kanu
5945270 nathan is an exciting player with a lot of potential he can take defenders on and is good on the ball he can score goals he has featured for the reserves in pre season and has done well
5945271 when he plays for the under 18 team he needs to be the best player every week and he knows that he has still got a lot to learn about the game but he is hungry and he wants to do well
5945272 we will establish the writ of the government at all costs as a parallel government cannot be tolerated
5945273 will not be peaceful as long as the isis policy continues when that changes yes the tribal territories will become peaceful
5945274 washington keen to burnish its credentials as a harbinger of global democracy had set its key ally in the war on terror an almost impossible task last year to step down as army chief hold free and fair elections and to remain in power
5945275 american leaders are telling musharraf to take off his military uniform and give real freedom to that country however the military is the only institution that gives stability to that extremely divided country this is another example of how little our leaders know about pakistan
5945276 americas ignorance and weakness helped to push iran into the arms of radical islam it could very well do the same to pakistan unless we learn from our history with iran
5945277 we cant afford to make the same mistake twice if we do it will become a nightmare for the whole world
5945278 the tribal areas of north west pakistan have become a taliban playground
5945279 as a result for the first time in the history of the country the army is no longer in a position to step in and impose order as before
5945280 recognizing that any attempt to impose order military style to a growing crisis of governance would only further destabilize the country the armys new leadership has put its weight behind the civilian government but since pakistani civilian institutions historically have never really functioned properly serious doubts about the viability of the newly democratic pakistan arise
5945281 a complete collapse of pakistani government rule that allows an extreme islamist movement to fill the vacuum a total loss of federal control over outlying provinces which splinter along ethnic and tribal lines or a struggle within the pakistani military in which the minority sympathetic to the taliban and al qaeda try to establish pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism
5945282 almost every day the u s seems to learn something new about the limits to its capacity as the worlds one remaining superpower
5945283 americas problem is even worse than a weak will we even help
5945284 we helped get rid of irans corrupt shah in 1979 he was replaced by ayatollah khomeini who began state sponsored terrorism in the middle east are we about to see another ayatollah rise to power this time in nuclear pakistan and will america be mostly to blame
5945285 pakistan has the nuclear bomb and could be taken over by radical islam with plenty of help from iran
5945286 that means it could become a proxy of the iranian mullahs this would be the worst possible disaster
5945287 its nice to finally find someone with a genuine question every once in a while
5945288 i am totally psyched about this mozilla is a new kind of foundation one with with participation transparency and innovation at its very
5945289 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5945290 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5945291 obviously some of that is oil but the reality of it is that is a lot
5945292 i think this is the bottom of the days range

5945306 universities teach music but they do not produce performing artistes they are only degree and diploma holders for this artistes need riyaj practice under the guidance of gurus in this gurukul we will also teach them how to perform on stage
5945307 i am really happy that they are building such a centre i think music should be a compulsory subject in schools like painting and sports
5945308 its clear that this is a wake up call not just to governments but to the community
5945309 we need to look at new ways new technologies and new methods to drive down these tragic figures
5945310 the death toll has risen to 30 after seven more blast victims died in hospitals
5945311 our initial clues reveal that he the bomber was from south waziristan tribal region
5945312 you must take personal responsibility you cannot change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can change yourself
5945313 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5945314 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5945315 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5945316 if i play a full calendar then i know where i can be in the world and thats all that really matters
5945317 obviously the guys ive lost to since i started at the french open have been the top four players in the world
5945318 so i probably havent had the kindest draws but thats what happens when youre not seeded as well
5945319 we can stand aside and say that is the way things are or we can try and do something about it
5945320 this is a new framework of australias aid relationship with the countries of the pacific it is based on a principle of mutual responsibility
5945321 australia has already indicated through the port moresby declaration that we are prepared to be long term partners with the countries of the region on their path to development but at the same time we need to see measurable progress
5945322 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice
5945323 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5945324 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material
5945325 transport infrastructure is expected to be an early priority for assistance
5945326 the facility will assist pacific island countries to improve roads ports transport systems support reliable energy and communications infrastructure and improve their water sanitation and waste management systems
5945327 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5945328 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
5945329 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session
5945330 we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve definitely
5945331 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
5945332 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
5945333 were now a team deep enough that if a harrys missing or a timmy missing or a duke is missing weve got people who can fill in
5945334 me and scotty do alright together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
5945335 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
5945336 i know what they can do and what they cant
5945337 i will wait until training camp when i have everyone in the group then i can make my mind up
5945338 they say you dont truly miss something or know how much it meant to you until its gone or taken away from you and i have missed it
5945339 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
5945340 i have been away for a very long time so the excitement and profile of where the game is at is very different for me
5945341 without being disrespectful to past players or past leagues from what i remember soccer in australia appears to be a different type of event
5945342 soccer in australia has obviously progressed a long long way and im just happy to be part of it
5945343 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
5945344 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
5945345 if i can lose another five kilos i will have a real opportunity to see within myself how close i can get to back to where i was
5945346 i feel like i am making progress every day the goalkeeper coach john crawley has been excellent with me and also working with all those young boys it puts a fire back in the belly
5945347 its time for me to put something back not only into football but into the community and using the experiences i have had to help people less fortunate than me
5945348 and ill continue to do that because i think i have a duty and a responsibility to do that
5945349 its good to use your bad experiences for a positive
5945350 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever

5945373 shes living her life shes been having dinner with friends shes working
5945374 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5945375 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5945376 i am ashamed that is my first thought i am sorry for what i did
5945377 i perceived him at that time and wrongly judged him to be a phony
5945378 here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
5945379 it was more about me and not him i was probably mad at myself for my failures
5945380 i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5945381 they were going to split time hes had a great spring and a great camp
5945382 scott noble and griff they have to come to the house

5945384 my dad always taught me theres a way youve got to fall
5945385 you just cant put your other hand down and try to break your fall just fall on your shoulder fall on your face and hold onto the ball tight
5945386 thats one thing im really emphasizing because of the delaware game
5945387 we could have won the conference we could have went to the national championship were really emphasizing ball security like coach matthews says if you fumble the ball if you dont hold onto the ball youre not going to play
5945388 if somebody fumbles its really like all of us fumbled us running backs have to hold the whole offense on our shoulders when were holding the ball
5945389 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production mr ramirez said

5945392 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it he said
5945393 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline said john kilduff an analyst at mf global
5945394 i think were fine with that were not going to try to play into the polls we know where we want to go this season we just have to come out and prove ourselves and show were better than that
5945395 i look at the teams we play and just know we have to bring it every single game
5945396 if they want to pick us first or pick us last we still have to play those games
5945397 i think we earned the right to be called that
5945398 restaraunts night clubs and the mall have all benefitted greatly local retail sales are up nearly 50 and restaurants have nearly all sold out for the next week and a half
5945399 and eventually i want to start my own online casinos business that will parallel my work in hollywood
5945400 im so thankful that many online casinos industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
5945401 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
5945402 i like the idea of having a online casinos conference in our town but cant sleep at night with all them creating a rucus
5945403 it wasnt so bad last year but last night i didnt get to bed until 3 am with all the shananigans going on
5945404 im really impressed by the presentation nedry waite did about up and coming online casinos businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative
5945405 people are buying this online casinos stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
5945406 we knew we had to hit the strikes and lay off the bad pitches we did that fairly well the first three innings and he started getting wild the more we hit him we were able to stay patient and draw walks
5945407 he threw me a changeup and he made me look pretty bad on it
5945408 so i figured hed come back with the same pitch so i sat on it and he just threw it right there in my wheelhouse so i just turned on it
5945409 we give him two or three weeks every year then we fire him then hes back at end where he should be
5945410 the no 1 thing he does and i hear this all the time is he made a great play just by running to the football he plays as hard as anyone ive coached in high school football hes got a motor that keeps running
5945411 my dad always told me thats the one thing you can control
5945412 everything in life thats the only thing you can do
5945413 i always asked him to contain the quarterback and he couldnt do that
5945414 he just turned and ran the kid down the sideline
5945415 it was a 10 15 yard run most kids wouldnt have kept going as a football coach you try to instill that in your kids and hes got it
5945416 and everyone thinks were good at soccer i wanted to prove to everyone that i could do it

5945501 the tragedy in all of this confrontation with russia is that the system thats proposed for poland and the czech republic is a scarecrow
5945502 its not something that europe can rely on it is not dependable if iran had missiles that could reach central europe which they dont yet this system couldnt be relied on to defend against them anyway
5945503 some of this may be just a threat but russia has shown in just the past week or so it has a formidable military force so if i were poland or the czech republic i would be more worried about russia than i would be about iran or north korea

5945570 i bring my kids here and the service its been good i come here when theyre open because its close to my home
5945571 ms johnson has medicaid and could go anywhere but shed rather come to us because of the service we provide
5945572 i enjoy working here and with my background providing care to those without insurance is very rewarding to me
5945573 when you compare the difference between the hours in the private sector what we are paid in the clinic might come out even
5945574 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
5945575 the land was purchased with the idea of future development
5945576 after three years of an unnecessary and foolish evacuation which contributed nothing to israels security we declare the reestablishment of homesh to this day the idf roams freely here and the territory has not been handed over to the arabs therefore there is no reason not to return the resident to their homes
5945577 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful
5945578 the risk is of creating a neo colonial pact for the provision of non value added raw materials in the producing countries and unacceptable work conditions for agricultural workers
5945579 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
5945580 we call on the government and judicial authorities to ensure the protection of prisoners to punish torturers and not to include them on amnesty lists
5945581 we couldnt carry out a better operation at the mossad than to put a guy like ahmadinejad in power in iran
5945582 to assure that the unlawful bailout by the republic of korea is stopped
5945583 for him to come out and play like that i hope hes nervous as hell friday
5945584 give me a couple of hours and itll probably smack me in the face thats the coolest thing about it we still want the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver were going home with some kind of medal
5945585 but losing the first match ended up helping us out otherwise we would have played brazil to get into the semifinals instead they put us on the top bracket with no brazilian teams we had a pretty easy road to the gold medal match
5945586 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
5945587 we may actually extract an unbounded amount of information from a single yes or no question by choosing the question carefully and then observing how much of the universe is destroyed by our asking it
5945588 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
5945589 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest
5945590 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5945591 after volunteering to serve as the shooter based on his marksmanship training previously in the u s marines young and other members of the crew including some who are now cooperating witnesses committed the drive by shooting
5945592 i hope that this house will bring us good luck and that there will be no more tragedies for my family
5945593 id like to give the cane to the lady but id also like to use it on him
5945594 i wish i had money to give her but i felt like i had to do something
5945595 he was talking to her and being a gentleman and his calm demeanor put her at ease
5945596 he grabbed her from behind and then she blacked out shes so upset the slightest noise startles her
5945597 the last couple of times the home games have let us down a little bit
5945598 the formula you would like to stick by in this situation is win the home games and look for your points whether its a draw or whatever away from home but if you win your home games you should be in good shape
5945599 guys are travelling different places and in different states of physical condition
5945600 but we have done our best to get as well organized as we can we have the better part of a day and a half now to further rest up and to get to as close to 100 per cent as we can be
5945601 we are looking at a few different things but we will clear it all up by wednesday
5945602 when i started this campaign everybody called me a young man theyre not calling me that anymore
5945603 its been gradual it hasnt been all of a sudden
5945604 i dont think hes trying to hide anything hes proud of the few gray hairs he does have
5945605 when i was coming up we were told it was a sign of wisdom
5945606 gray hair helps because it makes people look like theyre older and in his case he needs it
5945607 it has nothing to with anything except your genetic milieu everybody is programmed to get it at some point in life
5945608 i want to see him one more time but i dont want to see him like this
5945609 he was going to be a world champion no doubt about it
5945610 he had so far to go and now theres nowhere left
5945611 i believe that its our destiny to win the gold both teams deserve to be in the final but i think we will be the ones who end up as the champions
5945612 were really confident but well just have to wait and see because argentina have the likes of messi aguero riquelme and mascherano in their squad and they will give us a hard match
5945613 but its not going to be easy for them we have some great individual players and the coach has moulded us into a team were working hard for one another and were getting to be more compact in our defence
5945614 we have only conceded three goals during this tournament and i think were getting better as a team with each game that we play for me our best performance was against belgium and our second best performance was against c te divoire in the quarter finals but we want to be at our peak for the final match and i believe that we will be
5945615 to know that the hard work before and during the competition has taken us to the final and a shot at the gold is incredible
5945616 to see the improvements weve made since our performance in our first game is absolutely wonderful we have really grown as a team during this tournament and now were going to beijing reaching the final was one of our objectives when we got here and now we have to make sure we win the gold
5945617 we are going to have chances and i believe that with the strikers that we have we are going to score goals
5945618 we have a few experienced players up front and i think that we will score

5945630 es gibt keinen schlechteren zeitpunkt zum verkauf einer bank als in der gegenw rtigen krise sagte dirk becker von der landsbanki kepler sie sollten die verhandlungen f r ein jahr auf eis legen und dann wieder aufnehmen wenn alle risiken im zusammenhang mit der finanzkrise beseitigt sind
5945631 die deutsche post die zufriedenstellende operative ergebnisse ausweist steht nicht unter druck die postbank zu verkaufen
5945632 das problem ist dass es wegen der finanzkrise derzeit sehr wenige gibt die sich die postbank leisten k nnen

5945634 what were concerned about is having an impact on reducing the rate of recidivism and getting people who might be incarcerated who are re offending who are continually ending up back in prison we want them out of there
5945635 we want to look at what are the social determinants of offending behaviour and why people reoffend what opportunities are provided to people within the prison environment to ensure that they are able to achieve and sustain a good state of health
5945636 started smoking pot at an early age about 12 and started drinking around that age as well ended up in the illicit drug use scene at about 16 17 obviously to support my habit started doing time
5945637 no theres no problems about getting drugs in jail there was a lot of pot in there a lot of gear comes through there a lot of amphetamines
5945638 huge efforts have been made to stop the use of drugs in prison theyve not been successful
5945639 all that happens is that they become much more dangerous
5945640 and what we have to do is try and understand and thats what this research is about trying to understand why it is that these people have wound up in prison instead of in treatment what it is we need to do to try and ensure first of all a reduction in harm associated with their own drug use but also for the broader community the reduction in the spread of hiv hepatitis c and other blood borne viruses
5945641 physical health problems wounds that werent tended to just not being able to see the doctor and fellows who would cut themselves a lot of mental issues
5945642 we would think that one of the issues coming out of the research would be presenting a case for the government to extend medicare to all its australian citizens and most of us would think that probably is already the case
5945643 but it should be extended to people in prison as part of a whole process

5945648 for him to come out and play like that i hope hes nervous as hell friday
5945649 give me a couple of hours and itll probably smack me in the face thats the coolest thing about it we still want the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver were going home with some kind of medal

5945653 but losing the first match ended up helping us out otherwise we would have played brazil to get into the semifinals instead they put us on the top bracket with no brazilian teams we had a pretty easy road to the gold medal match
5945654 this just means we did what we set out to do
5945655 we still have one more match remaining to put the crowning achievement for probably our careers its fantastic to get there but the final goal is to get the gold medal if we dont get that ive still had a great time but ill be disappointed

5945657 terwijl het een tiental jaar geleden beperkt bleef tot enkelingen die hun humaniorawereld transponeerden en installeerden binnen de politiescholen
5945658 moeten we spijtig genoeg vaststellen dat de enkelingen van destijds nu jonge dertigers zijn geworden die in hun kielzog heel wat navolging hebben gekregen dat heeft voor gevolg dat terwijl het probleem zich vroeger beperkte tot de politiescholen nu ook de politiezones met de problematiek worden geconfronteerd voor zover geweten beperkt het zich hoofdzakelijk nog tot de politiekorpsen binnen de grootsteden omwille van het feit dat deze korpsen de grootste afnemers zijn van jonge afgestudeerde politieagenten jammer genoeg is het fenomeen als olie op water en moeten we ons geen illusies maken over de toekomst
5945659 alhoewel destijds door de media zeer sterk uitvergroot en bekritiseerd als een te tolerante drugswetgeving zijn de aanpassingen aan de strafwet in werkelijkheid minimaal
5945660 tot op heden kunnen drugs in belgi enkel via de illegale kanalen van het crimineel milieu verkregen worden
5945661 een onderscheid te maken tussen jongeren die nooit drugs gebruikt hebben of ooit in een bepaalde periode softdrugs gebruikten en de diehards die de duidelijke intentie hebben om ook tijdens hun politieloopbaan verder drugs te gebruiken en bij wie de toetreding tot het korps geen keerpunt betekent
5945662 deze ingesteldheid is logisch aangezien het hier gaat om mensen die geacht worden de criminaliteit te voorkomen en of te bestrijden
5945663 politiemensen hebben een voorbeeldfunctie elke vorm van afwijkend gedrag in strijd met de deontologische code is onaanvaardbaar

5945683 you go into my vineyard too 8 in the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his bailiff call the workers and pay them their wages starting with the last arrivals and ending with the first 9 so those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came forward and received one denarius each 10 when the first came they expected to get more but they too received one denarius each 11 they took it but grumbled at the landowner saying 12 the men who came last have done only one hour and you have treated them the same as us though we have done a heavy days work in all the heat 13 he answered one of them and said my friend i am not being unjust to you did we not agree on one denarius 14 take your earnings and go i choose to pay the lastcomer as much as i pay you 15 have i no right to do what i like with my own why should you be envious because i am generous 16 thus the last will be first and the first last

5945712 it has been one of the last fields to be affected this time meaning it will be one of the first areas to pick up again when the economy revives
5945713 no sector is immune from economic fluctuation but any downturn in it is only likely to be temporary because it companies simply cannot survive without it
5945714 with some outsourcing relationships being several generations old clients now have the experience to develop more robust platforms from which to bargain
5945715 a factor that could impact this trend for renewals is the accelerated m amp a activity in the second half of 2008
5945716 this will have ramifications for these companies it services and bpo providers with incumbent providers nervously wondering whether the new owner will bring in its preferred supplier or even take the service back in house
5945717 because they are not moved away from their workplace students can put their new found skills into practice as they progress throughout their learning

5945719 todays teenagers often view a career in the sciences as geeky or boring when the reality is very different

5945722 the push toward electronic medical records has made storing personal health information in a locked filing cabinet in your doctors office an outmoded guarantee of confidentiality today patients can gather their jumbled health information hospital visits drug prescriptions and health insurance plans and manage them through a number of different online services including google health microsofts healthvault and aol co founder steve cases revolution health

5945734 transport infrastructure is expected to be an early priority for assistance
5945735 the facility will assist pacific island countries to improve roads ports transport systems support reliable energy and communications infrastructure and improve their water sanitation and waste management systems
5945736 it is recognising that not only is new infrastructure needed to support economic growth and development but actually the capacity to improve and maintain existing infrastructure
5945737 its clear that this is a wake up call not just to governments but to the community
5945738 we need to look at new ways new technologies and new methods to drive down these tragic figures
5945739 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice
5945740 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5945741 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material
5945742 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
5945743 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session
5945744 we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve definitely
5945745 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
5945746 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
5945747 were now a team deep enough that if a harrys missing or a timmy missing or a duke is missing weve got people who can fill in
5945748 me and scotty do alright together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
5945749 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
5945750 i know what they can do and what they cant
5945751 i will wait until training camp when i have everyone in the group then i can make my mind up
5945752 i know what is the best combination on the field i have my ideas for the first game but theres still three weeks to go
5945753 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5945754 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5945755 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5945756 if i play a full calendar then i know where i can be in the world and thats all that really matters
5945757 obviously the guys ive lost to since i started at the french open have been the top four players in the world
5945758 so i probably havent had the kindest draws but thats what happens when youre not seeded as well
5945759 they say you dont truly miss something or know how much it meant to you until its gone or taken away from you and i have missed it
5945760 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
5945761 i have been away for a very long time so the excitement and profile of where the game is at is very different for me
5945762 without being disrespectful to past players or past leagues from what i remember soccer in australia appears to be a different type of event
5945763 soccer in australia has obviously progressed a long long way and im just happy to be part of it
5945764 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
5945765 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
5945766 if i can lose another five kilos i will have a real opportunity to see within myself how close i can get to back to where i was
5945767 i feel like i am making progress every day the goalkeeper coach john crawley has been excellent with me and also working with all those young boys it puts a fire back in the belly
5945768 its time for me to put something back not only into football but into the community and using the experiences i have had to help people less fortunate than me
5945769 and ill continue to do that because i think i have a duty and a responsibility to do that
5945770 its good to use your bad experiences for a positive
5945771 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
5945772 were happy with it we think it highlights the important role an industrial relations commission versus a fair pay commission
5945773 this decision demonstrates the fair pay commission is a joke
5945774 at the very least we would have liked the federal minimum wage decision to be reflected in the state awards
5945775 the fact that there could be two people working in similar worksites doing the same job on different wage rates is unacceptable
5945776 businesses that must apply this wage increase are already struggling with high interest rates rising petrol prices and increasing business costs
5945777 south australia is a small business state and this wage increase will make it increasingly difficult for employers by increasing the cost of doing business for those that can least afford it
5945778 we can stand aside and say that is the way things are or we can try and do something about it
5945779 this is a new framework of australias aid relationship with the countries of the pacific it is based on a principle of mutual responsibility
5945780 australia has already indicated through the port moresby declaration that we are prepared to be long term partners with the countries of the region on their path to development but at the same time we need to see measurable progress
5945781 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5945782 when they did that in california they had an 11 million litre tank that they partially drained every two hours
5945783 they had 30 people working around the clock and they force fed the whale with a massive tube not only do we not have the facilities to do that in nsw but the success rate of that method is only 2 to 3 per cent and it has never been tried on a humpback whale
5945784 it is likely only to distress or endanger the whale and to endanger those trying to carry out the feeding process
5945785 the new facility will allow our physicians and staff to provide the quality of health care that we need to provide for the children of the mid south and the region
5945786 some of our hospital is 60 years old and the building itself had not kept up with the technology of health care this is going to give us the 21st century building to complement the 21st century health care that we are providing for the kids
5945787 the demolition is completed the foundation is in the two tower cranes are up and were going to be pouring the first elevated slabs starting on thursday
5945788 he made a commitment to become an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him as a citizen as well
5945789 we have faith in the australian legal system but have no trust in the hungarian government who are willing to pursue an innocent man to this extent
5945790 demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
5945791 the record speaks for itself in addition to retaliatory actions despite numerous applications made no approvals for demonstrations have been reported

5945801 were starting to use search to justify traditional media budgets
5945802 two years ago no one was thinking about search that early in the process
5945803 two thirds of the people polled after exposed to some form of offline messaging were driven to perform a search then 39 percent of those people made a purchase
5945804 its not going to be the be all or end all of branded search but go to google and its not as compelling
5945805 how trustworthy do you find the advertising on these sites
5945806 whether it was making a purchase or going to the web site or visiting the advertisers store we found that visitors were more likely to take action after viewing these ads on local media sites
5945807 for the advertiser this provides some concrete understanding regarding how best to spend their dollars in terms of trying to connect with local consumers
5945808 we also found that the local media sites were attracting consumers who were actually spending more money online overall

5945829 akshay kumar is an inspiration for me he has handled his career beautifully im envious of him
5945830 akshay ventured into a completely different arena that is comedy and he was widely appreciated for it my bond has especially grown with him post hera pheri
5945831 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
5945832 with our production house doing well as an actor i dont have to be desperate im not so ambitious as to put my whole and soul into an acting career i can do solo hero films but id rather be part of bigger projects with salmanbhai that will have a smooth sailing release as a producer i know which projects will make it smoothly
5945833 yash tonk was originally doing my role he even shot for four days then he got busy with his television work
5945834 yash is a friend we did fight club together it was an awkward situation for him he called me up and requested me to get into his shoes since it was salmanbhais film i didnt think twice
5945835 its my first raw and real film and my punjabi is very scratchy i had to polish it up before i could face the camera i like wearing different hats especially for my brothers

5945838 its basically a brand name now and salmanbhai and govinda are part of that brand govinda keeps embarrassing us by praising bhai and me all the time
5945839 theres no hassle no sense of one upmanship no double hero ego problems and we share a great chemistry so producers like signing us together i was never supposed to be in salaam e ishq my track was added much later it had nothing to do with salmanbhai
5945840 im very happy with the acting work that i do acting is only a part of my life i want to produce give time to my wife and son and spend time with my friends i want to do quality work
5945841 and well continue to introduce new talent like prem soni whos directing main aur mrs khanna for us my hands are full till 2010 and im a producer first an actor later

5945843 my mother is very biased towards me my parents always wanted me to learn moralistic values as a child and even now i have been a big fan of my fathers films
5945844 i have watched my moms films but i was not comfortable people would judge her and i dont like anyone else judging my mother i am possessive about her
5945845 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
5945846 im my biggest critic whenever i go out with my friends to watch my film i keep looking for flaws i look critically the way i look in the film or the way i act
5945847 my friends keep telling me to shut up and stop criticising myself but i never stop they are so sweet that they tell me to just watch my films and enjoy them
5945848 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
5945849 yes i am talking to them i have to sign the contract as yet it is an interesting role for me which i cannot talk about but yes i am not going inside the house

5945852 terrorists are operating in kerala but their main activities are outside the state when we took police action against some of them there was a hue and cry from human rights activists saying that minorities were being targeted

5945861 the judge says you must have had a one nighter at least
5945862 he says ill give you one more chance to tell me the truth
5945863 i say i dont know how to say it another way
5945864 im ready to kiss the record goodbye if he keeps on doing what he has been doing
5945865 i used to think 19 32 was untouchable now i think it is touchable
5945866 im going out there and run my heart out and anything that comes comes but right now its kind of hard
5945867 ive been through four rounds of the 100 and three of the 200 so its kind of hard to go out there and get the record thats been so far away
5945868 im definitely going out there hoping i can win both but the 200 would mean a lot more to me
5945869 given that hes not the most technically sound 200 meter runner
5945870 you have to have somebody to go and catch coming off the first turn
5945871 you never know who is going to challenge the big man and make him break were all humans and at some time we can break
5945872 a primary is to select a candidate for your party to run for an office in the general election thats not happening
5945873 the party was always guaranteed to have someone in the general
5945874 thats not going to happen this time people complain about the two party system and that nobody good ever gets elected well it could not be a two party system anymore we could end up with two republicans two democrats in the general which is not a choice
5945875 if we have libertarian or constitutionalist running for one of those offices theyre not going to get there because they are not going to be one of the top two
5945876 i put it in all the popular ezines but nobody responded
5945877 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign

5945882 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5945883 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5945884 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5945885 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5945886 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5945887 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5945888 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time

5945895 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5945896 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5945897 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

5945958 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5945959 sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems and are especially vulnerable to overfishing and yet currently there are few effective controls on fishing or trade
5945960 theres no doubt that sharks are a very important part of our marine ecosystems while theyre not necessarily popular they are a important part of the food chain and we need to make sure that their populations are maintained
5945961 id like to see what the basis of the claims are but where we are needing to act we will

5945981 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5945982 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5945983 one of three things can happen its mother comes back its adopted by another pod or if we rear it in captivity
5945984 we have considered all possibilities and exhausted all possible rescue scenarios and along with other experts in the field we agree the animals suffering should not be prolonged and advocate for a humane outcome

5945986 the original peoples of europe north africa or the middle east
5945987 mexican puerto rican cuban central or south american or other spanish culture
5945988 the way people report race 20 or 30 years from now may be very different
5945989 obviously some of that is oil but the reality of it is that is a lot
5945990 i think this is the bottom of the days range
5945991 were still trading in the aftermath of last nights short squeezes
5945992 the government picks health plans then we have to pick a plan from their list
5945993 our community believes its very important to move on an agenda of health care reform
5945994 i think it shows that the american people are coming together
5945995 those who were opposed to health care reform in the past now know its critically important
5945996 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5945997 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5945998 exploit its expertise in telecom and get exposure to a segment of the cellphone industry that promises high growth the story says
5945999 its almost like i dont know i dont want to say its just really hard
5946000 at the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed me and i just couldnt move it anymore
5946001 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5946002 i crossed the line and it was very hard for me to pick myself back up
5946003 it took about 30 seconds todays hard tomorrows going to be harder but what can you do but try again
5946004 this is what i said i was going to do
5946005 i feel like i am living the american dream the u s is the land of opportunities and i am glad to represent it
5946006 coming out of a mexican american background it feels so good not many americans get to do something like this
5946007 postoperative ileus remains the single greatest barrier to hospital discharge in otherwise uncomplicated colorectal surgery
5946008 if this relatively easy safe and cheap intervention can help it is certainly something worth trying
5946009 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of hospital stay
5946010 this doesnt mean that if you give someone chewing gum they will just jump out of bed and feel good enough to go home
5946011 we have had no communication with the vessel so far the distress call was relayed through another ship but the tanker has been confirmed seized by pirates
5946012 this is the fourth hijacking in a month we call upon the u n and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening situation
5946013 well be ready to start receiving patients coming here with their families whether for plastic surgery knee replacements or cardiovascular treatment
5946014 we have so many hospitals with johns hopkins harvard some of the biggest names in the world are here doing work
5946015 people would go to london for shopping with their families and receive a check up or undergo a small operation now dubai is ready for this
5946016 we have so much to offer now with certified hospitals from international agencies
5946017 there are so many issues relating to medical tourism and because the area is developing so quickly its becoming essential that hospitals insurers and policy makers to name a few work together closely to streamline processes to cater to this market
5946018 im taking this job despite the fact that i dont have a degree in pharmacology
5946019 but the vocabulary used by the suits was defensive antiseptic and legally guarded
5946020 few things are more globally respected than the olympic games and to pardon one of the biggest frauds perpetuated on the olympic movement would be nothing less than thumbing our collective noses at the world
5946021 we have been working on the series 60 platform for touch screen user interface and a mobile device is expected to be launched by the year end
5946022 the new software would allow licensees to develop devices with a variety of input methods such as touch screen with traditional keypad qwerty keyboard or standalone touch screen supporting both finger or stylus optimised input
5946023 with the acquisition of symbian we will be able to offer our customers more innovative products and the latest technology
5946024 symbian is the largest mobile phone software developer globally and it is up to our customers to decide how popular and accepted our software is
5946025 my right hamstring grabbed on me and i couldnt move anymore i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt
5946026 im so disappointed ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control in the straightaway i was all over the lane
5946027 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5946028 it was just a shame that it happened in the biggest race of my life
5946029 i dont want to watch that sorry rascal he wont do nothing for the veterans
5946030 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5946031 i actually entirely agree that its the cheesy pop music of literature i just have a bit of a guilty pleasure in pop music
5946032 i know its horrible but i cant put it down
5946033 now if im sayin im fire im just preachin to the choir cause each of you admire what is reachin through the wire a trend setter for the way i blend letters beginning to end it tends to come out my pen better

5946035 preach the gospels of peace but keep your gun powder dry
5946036 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable
5946037 there are no two opinions about the need to switch over to other modes of power generation like nuclear energy and hydro coal based power production has to be restricted
5946038 coal based power generation is not a feasible proposition coal stocks are limited and might not be there always to generate power at such a large scale
5946039 from april 2007 to january 2008 around 255 million tonnes of coal was supplied to power utilities against the annual action plan target of 249 97 million tonnes
5946040 the situation is grim and unless fast track measures are undertaken by the ministry of coal and coal companies the ntpc stations face serious threat of taking units out of bar
5946041 which is why we have advised the ministry of power to retain the target of importing 20 million tonnes of coal for power plants in 2008 09 it will help them build up coal stocks at power houses
5946042 a long term solution to meet increasing electricity needs lies in switching over to hydro and other renewable modes for generating energy
5946043 i do believe that its the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel i do believe that it defies physics that world trade center tower 7 building 7 which collapsed in on itself it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved world trade center 7 world trade center 1 and 2 got hit by planes 7 miraculously the first time in history steel was melted by fire it is physically impossible

5946053 beam is my favorite event and ive worked hardest on this for a long time its the perfect ending to my olympic experience

5946059 i brake for whacking evil people i dont much like over the head with large hard objects
5946060 our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name prayers seeking absolution from some possible make believe creator the human mind cannot even comprehend itself yet let alone understand some things in nature but yet so many believe in an unseen force that watches over them like some authoritive father figure waiting for them to make a mistake in his eyes and when they do and they do trust me they must then ask for his forgiveness in order to be saved i believe when they pray theyre not looking for forgiveness from some omnipotent being theyre not searching for answers from above theyre looking into themselves for forgiveness its only when they are able to forgive themselves are they truly set free they owe nothing to anyone other than themselves its evolution those who believe also believe that their invisible savior gave them free will to believe or to choose not to believe this way they can deny you and live a guilt free life not knowing what you have in store for them forgiving ha let those who believe look to the old testament as a reminder to what you can and will bring upon them eventually yet slowly youre losing steam within a thousand years these talking monkeys you gave this freedom to will be worshipping harry potter the same way they worshipped your child who died by their hands mind you oh so many years ago they dont appreciate all you do for them not like we did
5946061 the only reason i kneel here before you now is because when they lose faith in you they forget me as well there is a coming twilight and only your hand can force them to believe yet now you still hold your grudge why even now when i humbly present and belittle myself by bowing to you and finally asking for forgiveness do you still forsake me father answer me i demand to know why i was once your chosen the elite of your ranks and yet you chose to send a monkey to reach out to the rest of the simians you love so much yet destroy all you give them why not me and when i try to open your eyes to this i pay the ultimate price hell isnt hot its the bitter cold i feel every day i am out of your light you can forgive them but you cannot even answer me

5946075 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
5946076 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
5946077 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
5946078 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
5946079 we would get things almost every day from people all over the country
5946080 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
5946081 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people
5946082 there is just so much these days with the internet and web sites and blogs but this was a story about a kid who was just so real that it grabs you
5946083 i know pittsburgh is probably all concerned about what the steelers are going to be like this fall and how maybe the penguins couldve done things differently in the stanley cup but this kids story was just so different
5946084 the story that the post gazette did started the fire for this kid if maybe i threw another log on to help get it going more then great because it deserved to be a bonfire
5946085 you never know what life might bring you you might have a few sniffles and think its not a big thing then you go to the doctor the next day and they tell you that you have a 10 pound tumor in your stomach
5946086 it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be
5946087 i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here
5946088 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
5946089 he said he just wanted to meet john coach maddon has really become touched by john and his message
5946090 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
5946091 now john had no idea about these madonna and a rod rumors about an affair and john goes so wheres your wife i couldnt believe it but a rod just said she was in florida at their other home with their kids
5946092 then john asked him if his wife worked john wasnt trying to be smart he was just curious he told john that she didnt work but that she had a psychology degree
5946093 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
5946094 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
5946095 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
5946096 if i can help someone else going through this then that would make me feel good
5946097 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is

5946112 right now with things the way they are a lot of students just cant afford to eat
5946113 more and more its just the typical traditional student about 18 to 22 thats feeling this crunch
5946114 theres definitely been an increase in usage and demand were seeing more and more students that have never used the pantry before
5946115 a lot of students cant call their mom every day to ask for that extra fifty dollars
5946116 our assumption is its because of the high price of food
5946117 before when i lived in the dorms i was on the meal plan
5946118 now that im in the apartment i have to pay for food and i have to pay my cell phone bill i dont make enough to pay for both
5946119 there is a stereotype that well if theyre in college they can afford to eat
5946120 but there are some students who have hardly any disposable income and because of that the food budget suffers they either eat really badly or they just dont eat enough
5946121 im already really poor and on a really tight budget
5946122 i have to pay rent and after that there isnt much left over
5946123 but if my parents say no were not going to give you any more money it may be a last resort

5946149 of course i wanted to be clearly understood i practised articulating my words more distinctly yet at the same time i wanted to retain the personality of my own voice and to be honest to my edinburgh roots

5946157 were just worried that hes going to come back how can a man who did all of this be out of jail i dont know where he is
5946158 i think the judge took those things into consideration when i asked for a higher bond
5946159 a judge can order whatever the judge wants to order
5946160 but its a better practice i think for a judge to do what the law requires in the first place than to bend the rules and make the defendant go to the court of appeals to straighten things out
5946161 this is a tragedy that affects two families and it will be a very difficult situation

5946180 we are not up there on a daily basis to make sure that the builders make it clear to everybody else
5946181 do they have their funding approved through txdot or through the federal highway administration the answer to that is no

5946183 we dont want to sit here paying mortgages on a home for the next two years knowing that its going to be torn down
5946184 what type of medical insurance do you carry for this child
5946185 its a systematic way of identifying every uninsured child and linking them with coverage
5946186 it was like a choice between health insurance and rent and groceries and we had to keep the rent
5946187 from that point i was able to take her to an actual ophthalmologist who specialized in the eye disease that she had

5946204 its going to be a tight squeeze getting these paths through there but we think we can do it
5946205 at that time the crossing can be widened to accommodate an additional bike lane if the city chooses to add one to the highway area
5946206 the angularity of the rail highway crossing cannot be changed but if the city will make a sidewalk bikeway that approaches the crossing at a 90 degree angle we will certainly work to match that

5946253 its not just that these cultures lack the words for numbers they just dont count things
5946254 what kinds of cognitive tools are provided by culture and what is provided by us when we come into the world
5946255 we need to ensure that there is a mapping between these basic concepts and the concepts youre trying to teach

5946263 we are in a form of liquidation now working with our lenders getting houses closed
5946264 were working through things with our lenders and trying to dispose of properties as we can
5946265 when we got squeezed on the ability to start houses it affected our cash flow
5946266 so most people are having trouble maintaining sales where they were that doesnt mean theyre all going out of business but some of them will

5946269 the problems you see in houston have everything to do with the fact that the market has gone back to a normal size
5946270 so what youre seeing is an adjustment in the existing home market and of course that spills over into the new home market as well

5946278 the cure for the inflation problem is a recession in the united states and europe
5946279 we have a recession and while thats lamentable it makes the inflation numbers old news
5946280 its valid it was unfair because it was a production sharing contract we have negotiated with them for a year it was turned from a sharing contract into a service contract
5946281 we decided that those oil contracts should be reconsidered not to be accepted just like that because things have changed the price of oil has changed the regime is new
5946282 we arrived at this consensus that those oil contracts should be reviewed
5946283 the last half of august is really going to tell a tale

5946303 part of having a disaster safety plan for your property includes taking actions to make sure that your trees are safe and not at risk for serious damage

5946308 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5946309 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5946310 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5946311 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5946312 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5946313 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5946314 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5946315 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

5946322 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board we were last aware that he remained in transit
5946323 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5946324 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

5946328 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5946329 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5946330 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances

5946335 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5946336 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5946337 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002
5946338 it concluded that we have critical infrastructure in this building and it needs to be protected
5946339 we would be remiss to not take action to protect this facility so we can continue to serve the community in the manner we do
5946340 how many times did planes strike the world trade center before 2001
5946341 the purpose of hardening our structure is because we have critical operations here
5946342 we said yes and thats when they did the assessment
5946343 its not going to affect public ingress or egress into the building and it will be architecturally similar to the walls we already have that serve that purpose
5946344 its still taxpayer money but for the city budget at least its a passthrough item it wont take away money from other programs
5946345 we should scrutinize that i would have remembered that if it came across to us
5946346 i would be interested to know if weve already committed to approving that you want to be sure money is being spent appropriately
5946347 i realize your culture must be more stringent with regards to traditionality but even so i could empathize in some ways

5946360 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
5946361 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
5946362 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
5946363 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
5946364 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
5946365 but at this point it is certainly hard to recommend extra supplements when we dont have proof of benefit
5946366 what we can recommend is a diet with fruits and vegetables that have antioxidant vitamins in them

5946370 when the world war broke out it was soon discovered that there were many persons living in various european cities on american passports who had no right to those passports whatsoever
5946371 there were a number of genuine americans residing in his city who had every right and privilege of registering in the consuls foreign office as americans and moreover they had done so but the police records of that city showed a much longer list of selfstyled americans who had never registered
5946372 for reasons not then apparent the department had no enthusiasm in correcting this unfortunate situation
5946373 by this time it was evident that these people would yield to nothing but force so force they should have a third letter was sent to them telling them that in case of further disregard of the invitation the local police would be asked to take up their passports that brought everyone in haste to the consuls office and lo they were all members of the chosen or privileged race the jews
5946374 not many days after this the consul received a call from an elderly individual known as the king of the jews a certain asher ginzberg this elderly individual let it be known that he was very much displeased that the consul had enforced the laws to the inconvenience of the people of his race

5946380 a year ago i think maybe once in a year someone mentioned it
5946381 this past year weve had over a dozen incidences where someone mentioned it and wanted to know what resources were available
5946382 the idea that over the counter medicine and prescription medicine is being abused by teens to get a quick high or to sell for money to other friends is something that parents and the general public arent really aware of or theyre not too concerned with because there is this misconception that its not as severe

5946387 being a military woman and nurse she was always very courteous lovable and always looking out for other people
5946388 we courted for four or five years before we married on feb 12 1958
5946389 she never had any hobbies because of her moving around but she liked to sing a lot
5946390 and she was a reader ever since she was a kid
5946391 almost any stray dog that would come by she would take it home
5946392 the reason why she had an attachment to dogs when she was there at the sru they were doing all their experimenting and research on dogs
5946393 she was what you call a lady she was just a good person full of life and loved her dogs

5946399 im very happy this is what we wanted and this is what he deserved
5946400 its not something that we felt could be fixed without some massive overhaul we think texas is really better served without it

5946402 the remaining 88 percent of reported cases are pursued by one party or the other using the legal system the very outcome the process was enacted to prevent
5946403 was never meant to be a true regulatory agency with a clear mission of protecting the public
5946404 consumers need real protections against unscrupulous builders who build shoddy homes and the trcc has never provided homeowners with that kind of protection indeed homeowners not builders are the ones regulated by the trcc
5946405 pulling the plug on the consumers most readily accessible and cost effective path to resolution is anything but constructive
5946406 they violated my rights they invaded my privacy the law entitles you to sue for that
5946407 i listened to a phone conversation with me and my wife and my kids

5946420 its just a dog you can buy another one relax
5946421 i dont feel a person like that should be working in law enforcement
5946422 im glad people understand that its not just a dog its a member of the family
5946423 that is one of the reasons the officers showed no urgency nothing the officers did or said caused this dog to die
5946424 it looks to me like the general fund and the operations and maintenance budgets are pretty darn tight
5946425 the only way youre going to get people to slow down is through speed enforcement
5946426 id hate to see that diminished i always thought traffic officers paid for themselves

5946437 the ground is already wet so if we get more rain like before its going to rise fast
5946438 theres absolutely no reason for them to have terminated me or have called for my termination
5946439 and i would have thought that there were better ways to spend taxpayer dollars than pursuing the agendas of certain board members

5946472 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice

5946483 the large sized lcd panel market has been mired in a state of severe oversupply since the start of june due to lower than expected panel demand and high inventory levels throughout the supply chain
5946484 conditions have worsened in august with poor economic circumstances causing prices to decline at an even faster pace than before however panel production cuts combined with the clearance of inventory and a recovery in demand from televisions desktop pc monitors and notebook pcs are expected to shift the supply demand equation back to balance in september this will lead to a recovery in pricing
5946485 reacting to weak sales and declining profitability panel suppliers began to slash their utilization rates starting in july
5946486 lcd tv and desktop pc monitor manufacturers also are starting to cut their prices in order to reduce inventories and boost end user demand these developments along with recovering demand from the notebook segment will bring stabilization to large sized lcd panel pricing in september some panel prices may even increase by 1 3 especially those which are reaching at or below the cost levels

5946562 thats the thing i knew intellectually but i had no concept of the amount of competition and if youre not rising youre falling and it seems like a competitive dog eat dog sort of world so the pressures push you to that point where you can make some mistakes due to deadlines and things like that and get in a lot of trouble the thing i think is difficult to see especially in this film because of those time constraints people end up in a situation where theyre delivering news thats not news and it happens all the time the retraction page is always with these tiny little articles that say we screwed up sorry whoops but its supposed to be news the lines that are blurred today between celebrity journalism and news celebrity gossip and news and the way the internet has such a huge effect of bringing in the idea of opinion as fact so its hard to compete with perez hilton whos writing whatever he wants the fine line between entertainment and news is getting finer every day

5946579 it feels good to see him come so far and to really say truly that hes the hottest dude out all around hes the one at the end of the day andre and kanye aint drop albums yet tip has his album out t i vs t i p when it comes to being relevant with hit songs every song hes done has been a part of a movement from r kellys im a flirt to the justin record my love then his swagger the respect he has across the board and you gotta give it to him for the movies too hes all around tip really has graduated from the jay z school of hip hop
5946580 yeah this is what the streets tell me just as many people ride to the dedication as they do to waynes album he dissed me he should have been one of the first people to come stand up for me just because of what the dedication meant to the streets but i cant take away what hes accomplished in the booth nobody can take that from him you havent heard his album yet i think that hurts him though because at the end of the day thats the edge i give tip tip is relevant hes spitting and at the end of the day when he drops he sells wayne has yet to drop his next album but hes had such a passion for the game hes on everything and its all quality i like da drought and i like all his verses but when i put the dedication mixtape together it sounded like an album
5946581 when its all said and done he might wind up second on my list of greatest of all time two years ago people were asking if andre will rap again every time he comes he murders it everything hes on he crushes his verse on devin the dudes what a job is one of the best verses of the year for me
5946582 his sh is crazy the first two songs he came out with stronger and cant tell me nothing were strong looking at this list and thinking about all the mcs hip hop is on fire right now kanyes remix game has also been phenomenal i love the remix of cant tell me nothing when he says after all the drama k slayed em kanye is that guy
5946583 hov in my book is the greatest of all time i personally believe when people look back on kingdom come its gonna be considered a classic album his remix game is incredible and the songs hes choosing to get on with guest appearances are incredible like andre the song selection is phenomenal and you know hov every time i hear him spit i get excited he still has been able to stay relevant and on top of his game in the position hes in i dont know if its out of contention because of the time frame but nas black republican featuring jay z was so overlooked if they would have shot a video for it it would have gotten timeless club play you cant really bang that in the club everywhere nationally because it didnt have a movement behind it but that song was phenomenal hes a prime example that at every level of the game we are fans and have passion
5946584 hes another person that has been consistent time and time again except for that little drop off period we all know about the people is one of my favorite records right now common may not have the biggest singles but his albums are always so anticipated he always comes with a banger it feels like he does it to please the people the ogs f with him the girls f with him people who love true hip hop love him everybody respects common
5946585 jeezy dropped the usda album it got a really good response he was on my song takin pictures and khaleds remix to we takin over he keeps making the streets happy hes also keeping himself current jeezy always has the streets in the palms of his hands and hes to the point now where youre starting to see his swagger in other rappers some people are redoing his style hes a fan favorite among other mcs even if his lyrics arent the most super complicated
5946586 50 is just 50 even at a time when people speak on 50 can he do it will he do it hes not as hot hes still on the tip of everybodys tongue his first two singles were good songs but people were just used to 50 dominating when he comes out just when people were concerned about him especially after the bet awards performance he drops a bomb like i get money which is classic 50 with all the other business ventures he has his hands in you cant deny 50 with his power and presence
5946587 his freestyles have been crazy my drink n my 2 step is just starting to heat up but as far as consistency as a mc fab is a problem when hes spitting i think hes in a good setup position out of everybody on my list he probably has the least new material out but his anticipation and potential level is great
5946588 fab has been quite consistent in the last couple of years the diamonds song it was a good street record and then he killed it straight fab style with you make me better recently hes been heating up the remix side of things poppin up with swizz and eve and elsewhere fab also has the swagger when people say new york is suffering he proves when you make a banger its a banger everywhere the brooklyn record was crazy too he was the middleman between an og jay z and a new n a uncle murda
5946589 he embodies all of what it means to be a rapper
5946590 he makes records with a purpose and his charisma is crazy you dont want to end up beefing with this guy hes a hell of a chess player when it comes to that and he makes great music
5946591 what else can you say that no one else has we are not the same i am a martian this dude is ahead of his time
5946592 this dude is ice cube mixed in with biggie throw in some pac scarface and jigga and there you have it rick ross my favorite rapper right now trilla one day the world will see what i been seein in this dude greatness
5946593 he took an artistic and creative approach to his already signature style on the inspiration i appreciate when artists push the envelope hes inspired many many rappers in a short two years with his unique flow and he makes street music
5946594 i have to list him because his music is still relevant to this day more so than many current artists all eyez on me the don killuminati and me against the world are in constant rotation in every one of my cars if hes not alive prove it to me
5946595 no one is more anticipated or in more guest spots than wayne
5946596 this dude would be 1 if he was on more stuff or his album was out no one is spittin like him right now hes killing the few remixes that hes been on
5946597 dude can straight out spit people get too caught up in the outside drama sometimes to give him a fair shot game just straight merks records hate him or love him
5946598 i feel he should be higher and that any of the top four artists on my list could rotate between 1 the buzz when he drops a snippet alone is crazy and i just heard a couple joints off his album like good life which is outta here cant tell me nothin and stronger are crazy
5946599 although i personally was a little disappointed in t i vs t i p he still sells and is everywhere and always comes with smasssh singles so he deserves to be 5
5946600 although in the twilight of his career anytime he jumps on something people notice even though it isnt as exciting hearing jay as it used to be
5946601 he has the best album to come out this year so far finding forever in my eyes common is just amazing and so consistent throughout his career he still is slept on which is why i had to put him at only 7 i personally think he is up there with the best
5946602 the impact jeezy had two years ago still is around although faded a little but his charisma ad libs only on kanyes single cant tell me nothing prove this and overall street music keep him in the top 10
5946603 just listen to the last mixtape messiah cds hes put out in the last year that solidifies his spot on its own
5946604 right now i aint even gonna front i dont remember nobodys lyrics thats when it gets bad hip hop when you remember somebodys lyrics thats when a n a got some sh on you i cant quote nobodys rhymes right now i couldnt tell you who it is
5946605 i literally have been talking about andre 3000s lyrics all day
5946606 how do you explain that wayne has been around for a good seven years and hes just now reaching this iconic status im not gonna say the whole best rapper alive thing but put together the swag the image the lyrics hes coming close to the complete package the hunger hes rappin his ass off its a lot of people that rap their ass off but it feels like hes having so much fun with it im a fan im not a super duper die hard fan but i appreciate whats coming from weezy
5946607 kanyeeezeee did you hear his freestyle over the i get money beat its effortless you could tell it was off the top of the dome as a rapper he got so nice his flow is fluid its nothing forced about it its a whole lot of swag with yeezee and hes saying sh i had a dream i could buy my way to heaven ill say this you cant tell me when you heard throw some ds you wasnt pleasantly surprised he flipped it on a whole nother joint hes clever
5946608 the streets let me tell you something im on satellite radio taking callers and people will just call up saying i wanna hear some murda im coming from tampa florida its not even any bias the fact i got involved with his project to begin with is that i saw the streets was gonna eat it up they love it he taps a certain chord in you
5946609 hovie is perennial if you listen to freeways big spender and just when you think the dude has cashed out with 200 million from this doing all this extra curricular sh hes still slaying you lyrically trust me that 5 is because hes been killing it effortlessly he could easily go to 1
5946610 swizz has new york on his back and hes a producer i dj all across the country and theres only a few current new york records that get played across the country and 85 percent of them happen to be a swizz record or produced by swizz or featuring swizz hes entertaining it is what it is its the new era of hip hop and hes entertaining if you set the criteria for your list with swagger and entertaining swizz should be on your list
5946611 for the mere fact that the usda album as a crew album people were expecting it to be some throwaway sh was haaarrrd bod deee jeezy is a movement understand the streets live and die by jeezy jeezy for the influential factor alone you got people from the north and south trying to make jeezy records thats undeniable the usda album was crack on a stick beautiful
5946612 he has a certain way he puts his words i dont think anybody else can mess with he was probably one hit away and the car crash and jail happened probably put a hindrance on his momentum but i like cassidy thats why hes there my drink n my 2 step is crazy though
5946613 t i vs t i p was dope t i is taking the whole t i vs t i p to the next level hes taking it to where it needs to go i love his joint with jay i love we do this you know we be ridin fly for him to have the biggest first week sales of everybody is a crazy accomplishment 456 000 for the record is the new 856 000 the game is crazy the game is on its head
5946614 hes perennial too he laid the groundwork for being hard for this generation he set the precedent for the uncle murdas and hell rells cant nobody deny s p the ghost
5946615 i didnt say jay z because i consider jay to be one of the greatest mcs he would be 1 kanye is 1 now because that dude be busting man he dont say the average stuff he says everyday real life situations

5946628 its always been the b plot i think thats by design creatively that the thing has more impact when its not carrying the entire weight i think it was promoted a little too romantically at times i always felt jealous on these thursday night promos because everybody else had these really funny clips on and then ours was like do i still love you but i dont know i think our tone has been kind of consistent with the amount of poignancy to comedy

5946632 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5946633 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5946634 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop

5946641 each year the u s treasury departments office of foreign assets control collects millions of dollars in penalties from american corporations who have violated these sanctions from oil companies banks food and beverage companies and entertainment companies
5946642 no executive of any such corporation has faced criminal charges individuals businesses and organizations that have openly defied the sanctions have faced only fines criminal prosecutions have only been made against muslims and people of middle eastern origin accused of violating these economic sanctions and unlike those corporations there was no profit motive in dr dhafirs case

5946645 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5946646 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5946647 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5946648 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5946649 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5946650 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5946651 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5946652 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5946653 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime

5946685 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5946686 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5946687 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5946688 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5946689 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5946690 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5946691 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5946692 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5946693 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5946694 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5946695 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5946696 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5946697 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5946698 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5946699 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5946700 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5946701 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5946702 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5946703 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5946704 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5946705 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5946706 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5946707 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5946708 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees

5946710 walaupun demonstrasi itu berbentuk pembelaan terhadap dasar negara ia tetap dianggap salah malah kerajaan tidak berhasrat membenarkan pelajar untuk berdemonstrasi dalam pindaan akta universiti kolej universiti 1971 auku
5946711 saya ingin mengingatkan pelajar di universiti tempatan lain supaya tidak mengulangi tindakan sama seperti dilakukan pelajar uitm pada masa depan ketika berdepan dengan sesuatu isu

5946716 fighting to become part of the system here in england the traditions and whatnot though as the show progresses he slowly starts to understand them and embraces them
5946717 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
5946718 says deschanel explaining that brennan a more sophisticated world traveler has an easier time of it working overseas
5946719 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental
5946720 hepburn and tracy kind of thing the witty stylish fond but confrontational relationship of brennan and booth
5946721 i think going into season four this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship
5946722 we are getting very good production value weve shot in places you cant believe we shot in front of the bank of england we are going to shoot right near tower bridge i thought it would be just a distant thing but its this close
5946723 i think one of the best parts has been working with the actors here the talent pool is gigantic
5946724 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5946725 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5946726 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5946727 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5946728 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5946729 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5946730 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5946731 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5946732 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
5946733 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
5946734 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5946735 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k

5946740 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
5946741 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
5946742 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
5946743 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
5946744 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
5946745 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
5946746 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
5946747 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
5946748 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
5946749 weve come a long way from comin down and sayin man

5946758 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5946759 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5946760 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5946761 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5946762 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5946763 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5946764 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5946765 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5946789 se dice que el sabio le explic que la brecha entre los ricos y los pobres no se puede cerrar a la fuerza porque las condiciones de la vida actual son siempre las consecuencias de las acciones de la vida anterior y por lo tanto no es posible cambiar el curso de la vida por la fuerza de la voluntad
5946790 desde un punto de vista puramente secular esta doctrina debe considerarse una de las formas m s ingeniosas y nocivas de control social que se haya inventado para el tibetano com n y corriente aceptar esa doctrina significaba aceptar la idea de que es imposible cambiar su destino si uno nac a esclavo seg n la doctrina del karma no era culpa del esclavista sino su propia culpa por haber cometido delitos en una vida anterior a su vez la vida privilegiada del esclavista era la recompensa que este recib a por lo que hizo en una vida anterior as pues el que intentara romper las cadenas de su presi n se condenaba a s mismo a una vida futura peor de la que ya padec a evidentemente no son ideas que llevan a la revoluci n

5946858 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5946859 sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems and are especially vulnerable to overfishing and yet currently there are few effective controls on fishing or trade
5946860 theres no doubt that sharks are a very important part of our marine ecosystems while theyre not necessarily popular they are a important part of the food chain and we need to make sure that their populations are maintained

5946872 this is home he made a commitment to become an australian citizen 50 years ago and i think australia needs to make some commitment to him as a citizen as well
5946873 so badly that he died from his injuries late that evening
5946874 obviously some of that is oil but the reality of it is that is a lot
5946875 i think this is the bottom of the days range
5946876 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000
5946877 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
5946878 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
5946879 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday

5946894 its totally anti public anti congress anti state actions but unfortunately the state department thinks it has the power to adopt this boundary line with the russians without anybodys consent outside themselves
5946895 the state department is basically chopping off a piece of alaska and giving it to a foreign government without alaska having any say in it

5946897 its just a matter of finding sympathetic people in washington and the other states to go for it theres plenty of organizations who have endorsed our efforts so we keep up the drumbeat

5946927 weve had positive dialogue with regulators about our current action plans and they accept that we are making good progress
5946928 the action plans which were being prepared at the time of the inspection reflect our own risk assessments and also respond to issues identified by the ombudsman
5946929 we keep these under review despite the system change the vast majority of claimants received correct payments throughout the period
5946930 this shows that the benefits section is clearly not a dysfunctional service as claimed by the ombudsman it has had problems but were certainly on the right path towards resolving them

5946935 no son buenas noticias para el gobernador si el gobernador llega a las elecciones que por su propia naturaleza me imagino continuar va a llegar inv lido
5946936 lamentablemente lo victimizan y lo colocan en una posici n pol ticamente h bil para recavar el voto de las huestes de su partido y del sector puertorrique ista del pa s
5946937 no hay duda que esta radicaci n adicional de cargos es una agenda pol tica personal en contra del gobernador e institucional en contra del partido popular democr tico son cargos pol ticamente motivados
5946938 lejos de plantearse el retiro de la candidatura del gobernador la candidatura se fortalece ya que se patentiza ante el pa s una agenda pol tica sin l mites y nada tiene que ver con lo pudo haber sido un caso judicial que se viera en sus m ritos

5946940 me parece que el partido popular debe evaluar seriamente el postular a un candidato que sustituya a an bal acevedo vil

5946948 at that time she was a stranger to me i just found out it was her because it was in the news but im happy that there are good people left in this community
5946949 the father was deployed at the time and the mother was under a lot of stress
5946950 ive learned shes not a bad mother she was just really struggling
5946951 her husband was in iraq i see her now and shes really great with her kids
5946952 the advantage of the incomprehensible is that it never loses its freshness
5946953 for many years i was a self appointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully though i never received payment for it
5946954 your audio horoscopes help me love myself better and i mean that in a non narcissistic way

5946956 the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes
5946957 either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the minds eye quite as much as of the bodily eye
5946958 the uncreative mind can spot wrong answers but it takes a very creative mind to spot wrong questions
5946959 the best part about your audio horoscopes is that they pat me on the head and kick me in the ass at the same time
5946960 your audio oracles go beyond helping me find the truth they inspire me to find the wild truth
5946961 if the kitten didnt want me then i dont want the cat

5946969 i thought about it for a few months its pretty scary situation for anybody to go to court even adults there are better than 3 000 kids just in the panhandle area waiting so i got involved and found out they really need a lot help from volunteers
5946970 i thought about the goal of every child having a voice i firmly believe that they should
5946971 and when i met my child he was so polite and friendly now hes a part of my heart i go to see him about once a month and i fill out a report for the court about how hes doing and if there are any needs ive identified that need to be addressed
5946972 you just try to get to know the child gain his trust and confidence and listen to them so you can express their feelings wants and needs to the caseworkers attorneys and the judge
5946973 someone has to help him his parents didnt know he had problems or how to help him
5946974 he needs extra tutoring or he will end up being lost in the system or drop out of school
5946975 theyre part of a team which includes a case coordinator and a program attorney all working together to assess and address the best interests of the children represented
5946976 volunteers develop relationships with children who often have had no stable adult in their life showing these children that someone truly cares about them
5946977 they act as advocates in the court system for abused and or neglected children
5946978 if you have a love for children common sense good judgment and the commitment to walk with a child through a difficult time in his or her life the guardian ad litem program needs you

5946983 im a huge fan of spy movies and thats what we tried to do with this movie we tried to make it a legitimate spy movie that was also funny
5946984 so there is action its exciting and its fun at the same time

5946986 when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole
5946987 she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house
5946988 she hasnt been through all the stuff we went through to get here
5946989 this is the end and this should be the fun times we all got the speech from rex that he wants to be here in the final with his girlfriend
5946990 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish i think she likes everyone running about after her
5946991 rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual
5946992 maybe its we just clash things doesnt ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick

5947063 we launched the first version of simplify media last summer for the past year weve experienced smooth growth but all of that changed dramatically less than 4 days ago when our application debuted in the apple app store our aggressive target was to have 100 000 downloads in 30 days instead we reached that goal in about 30 hours as of last night we had 205 909 downloads

5947135 the pope doesnt understand the reality of the indians here his statement was wrong and indefensible i too was upset
5947136 how can the pope say that the evangelization was not imposed
5947137 then why did our indigenous people have to flee to the jungles and the mountains
5947138 not even his holiness can come here to our land and deny the holocaust of the indigenous people
5947139 christ came to america much later he didnt arrive with columbus the anti christ came with columbus
5947140 just like the catholic church has recognized errors as a descendant of those martyr indians that died by the millions i ask with all respect your holiness apologize because here there was a real genocide

5947147 all is not well with the health care management at the gmc
5947148 patients in the meantime are not to get treatment for their ailments at the hospital in rooms with dirty and non functional bathrooms and dirty rooms
5947149 health care pre supposes a clean and an unpolluted environment
5947150 within the area of the building where the pwd had declared the roof of the room to be unsafe and therefore part of the medicine ward which was functioning in the adjoining room had to be evacuated
5947151 gmc is primarily a teaching institute but at present it is loaded with all types of cases from common cold to complicated ones and resident doctors work really hard to treat the patients this needs to be channelled to improve the situation at gmc
5947152 politicians directly interfere in the functioning of the gmc and the appointment of staff besides a lot of money is spent on unwanted things such as landscaping while basics such as gloves and syringes are missing
5947153 we have also gone through the report of the commissioners of the court and we have taken a number of steps to improve the situation

5947156 photos show people walking around in the hole in the north tower where 10 000 gallons of jet fuel were supposedly burning
5947157 by the time the south tower was hit most of the north tower s flames had already vanished burning for only 16 minutes the fire did not grow over time probably because it quickly ran out of fuel and was suffocating rather than the sprinkler system dousing the fires

5947160 i hope the london bus will be a new symbol of shimonoseki
5947161 at first i wondered if the london bus would suit the city but now i can tell its well suited to the retro look of the city
5947162 the bus was tough to drive because it has its own style
5947163 but driving the london bus is a lot of fun as people wave their hands to us with a big smile which had never happened before in my career
5947164 it was so scary as the roof is high so the balance can shift really easily but im used to it i hope it will top the tourists list in shimonoseki
5947165 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just it is an honour for france and its army to defend it
5947166 how old is aj alex is 6 hes getting ready for what would be first grade last year he went to a state school for the severely handicapped this year is going to be different because we moved hell be going to a special school district apparently its a self contained classroom in the public school idk how this will work because he was rejected from the public school even the special ed classes prior to kindergarten based on the fact that hes a flight risk and because hes too much of a distraction for the teacher and that hed been in early childhood for 2 years and made no progress
5947167 so im worried about putting him in that position now i guess theres nothing i can do about it until he starts then we can see where to go from there does it ever get better easier three years ago alex had a half age delay i thought that ment that hed always have a half age delay like when hes 20 hell be like a 10 year old but now hes 6 and is still like 18 months
5947168 i have so many questions no one else in my family has an autistic child i have a pretty big family and i just dont understand if theres a genetic predisposition and 1 150 kids are diagnosed where are the other kids well thanks for taking the time to listen i hope to hear back from you
5947169 if you keep super imposing past hurts or circumstances on a current relationship youll only serve to cut short what could otherwise be a long term and fulfilling relationship or friendship try to see your current relationship for what it is rather than relying on past judgments

5947174 while business was slower last fall and early winter it started to pick back up again around april 1
5947175 its been busier but not like it was two years ago when we would be seeing four or five closings a day
5947176 commercial closings which are about 10 times the paperwork of a residential also bring in that proportionate amount of money
5947177 weve also seen a number of short sales where the seller gets the lender to agree to take whatever will zero the seller out
5947178 the buyer might be sending the lender 75 percent of whats owed on the house and the lender says fine rather than put the house back on the market
5947179 they have a lot more work than three to four years ago
5947180 but its a lot better here than anywhere else because of our diverse economy and noncyclical employment that provides a little stability
5947181 theres so much going on its hard to know who to talk to or get information from
5947182 with real estate law you cant do a lot of litigation
5947183 if realtors come in and want to do a closing you cant say oh ill be in court you have to be flexible
5947184 its usually a happy type of law the buyers are happy the sellers are happy
5947185 its different from domestic relations or family law where people are more upset and angry
5947186 its an area where law work can end up in a win win situation for both clients rather than an adversarial situation

5947211 i would loved to have done both but i was told that wasnt going to be possible i had done the footy for such a long time and had given it my all i wanted a new challenge and to do something different
5947212 this is my opportunity to make it happen in an individual sport i will know if i dont win a medal then its down to me and not the team
5947213 it was great scoring the winning goal in that game
5947214 we had been two goals up before france pulled one back late in the game
5947215 it was a bit of a panic for the last five minutes but we hung on and we deserved it it finished on a high for me and for the team
5947216 however at that stage i still didnt know if i had qualified for the judo in beijing i thought i had done enough but wasnt sure so i was playing in the europeans knowing it might be my last competition and i was concentrating on keeping focus and giving it my best
5947217 i thought i had a bad tournament at the world championships in argentina in 2006 so i was desperate to go out on a high and i trained really hard to make sure that could happen
5947218 my aim is to do my best i havent set myself any target above that
5947219 ive been training well and really hard and i feel i havent left any stone unturned im trying not to put too much pressure on myself and ill go out there and do my best i will hopefully get a medal but what will be will be
5947220 if it wasnt profitable i wouldnt be able to stand here

5947240 who are these guys and why cant they play baseball
5947241 lots of ups and downs and it has been a very good learning experience it has been both tough and good but that is what baseball is about
5947242 i finished up the season in lake county last year
5947243 i just really got off to a good start and had a good spring training i just let it pretty much carry over i wasnt really thinking too much i was just going out and pitching it is no big secret i had a good team and good defense behind me and i know that made it easy for me sometimes
5947244 i came up to kinston and i was really pumped up in lake county i got off to a good start and was rolling with it and in kinston i just kind of got shell shocked a little bit my first outing i gave up my first runs of the season in that outing those guys are a little better a little older and they will make you pay for it if you make a mistake it was not a byproduct of the league it is me i went out there and i was trying too hard to make a lot of my pitches and i was bouncing my breaking ball here and there and getting behind i just had a rough patch and am just now getting myself out of it
5947245 he has major league late game setup man written all over him
5947246 the velocity is there with a plus plus fastball and he has a projectable plus plus curveball he has the mental skills for the setup role with shades of a rafael betancourt type guy but i feel he goes beyond that he is kind of like a john wetteland where he might end up being like a closer he has the joe borowski type curveball and he has the wetteland type velocity that is a pretty good combo there
5947247 all the running and stuff i had to do was really tough last season so in the 2007 offseason i just really went home and worked as hard as i could and ended up losing about 35 pounds
5947248 this year they let me put some weight back on which has helped and my arm feels better i am at 240 pounds now and happy at that it has made me healthier and hopefully able to make it through a full season so we will see how i feel at the end of the season
5947249 i started playing baseball year round and did not play football my senior year
5947250 i just really gained a lot of respect and love for the game it is a grind and it is more a grind than football really because in football you can train all year in the offseason in the weight room and then you have 13 games of football and you are done but you have to make it through a 140 games of baseball i just never realized how tough baseball really was until i did that once i did that i was sure i made the right choice in becoming a professional baseball player
5947251 i am learning to not be just a thrower but a pitcher
5947252 sometimes there is a guy who is going to be able to turn on your best fastball and you gotta actually pitch i like to take it to them as best as i can but i also am starting to learn you have to go into a pitching mode and actually make a pitch i just cant go out and bulldog people all day i have to take a step back and make a pitch and execute
5947253 im just trying to execute a little more and pitch with conviction and not second guess anything
5947254 it is not like i am going out there and am afraid of anybody i am just kind of going out and second guessing myself every once in awhile and i am getting into my own head it will be fixed it is nothing to worry about
5947255 if there is one thing i am working on it is that
5947256 i threw it one time in lake county and i have been trying to work on my other pitches before i can throw it here i always like adding something new it is always nice to be able to fool someone with a pitch when you are up on them 0 2
5947257 no i was pretty much going to take a shot
5947258 i just wanted someone to give me a chance and i knew getting drafted late i was not going to get money i didnt care i just wanted to play when money becomes an issue later on ill make it in the majors if i get there money was not an issue for me i just wanted to play
5947259 am obligatia morala fata de chisinau sa i aduc mai multa democratie mai multa deschidere catre europa
5947260 daca e sa judecam dupa declaratiile sefului serviciului de securitate al ucrainei la o a doua etapa se pare ca va urma retragerea autonomiei pentru crimeea si masuri dure de control asupra flotei ruse din marea neagra
5947261 trebuie cercetata fiecare iesire in larg a navelor flotei ruse din marea neagra daca acestea au fost coordonate cu ce armament au iesit vasele din sevastopol si cu ce s au intors trebuie verificare jurnalele de bord si determinat astfel daca actiunile acestor nave contravin sau nu legislatiei noastre si dreptului international

5947264 help drive strategic direction influence key decision makers and eliminate politics across all departments
5947265 provide objective assurance and consulting services to assess whether risks are appropriately identified and managed
5947266 que no est n solos que entre su recuerdo y el de todos nosotros mantendremos viva la memoria y la dignidad de las v ctimas del terrorismo
5947267 nu e primul care i ncearc profe iile pe mine am nt lnit n carier mai mult de unul i niciodat nu i am luat n serios
5947268 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5947269 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5947270 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5947271 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5947272 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5947273 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5947274 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5947275 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5947276 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5947277 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5947278 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5947279 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5947280 hes disgraced himself hes an embarrassment to the clayton county police department his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone and i have no use for him
5947281 his behavior is unbecoming of that of a police officer
5947282 this turn of events from hero to someone who defrauds a nation is just baffling i dont know how he got from one point to the other
5947283 we havent been able to get in touch with him
5947284 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
5947285 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
5947286 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
5947287 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
5947288 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
5947289 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
5947290 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
5947291 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
5947292 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
5947293 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
5947294 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
5947295 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
5947296 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
5947297 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
5947298 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5947299 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5947300 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5947301 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5947302 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5947303 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5947304 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
5947305 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5947306 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5947307 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
5947308 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
5947309 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
5947310 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state
5947311 we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
5947312 the good news from america most environmentalists are indeed leftists who support the redistribution of wealth and believe in a simpler lifestyle
5947313 i think that winter is quite a lonely month it makes me feel sad and sometimes even grumpy i like summer better because when you get home after school its still light outside and it makes me feel cheery its cold outside during the cold wet days i usually stay inside and watch tv or play on my games console if it snows then i wrap up warm and play outside i think that there isnt really much to do in winter friends in winter i play with my friends less than in the summer because its colder but also because it gets dark early in my opinion cold does influence the way you live and limits the things you can do i hope winter leaves soon and summer comes again quickly
5947314 espero llegar a tiempo para ganar alg n torneo grande
5947315 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5947316 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5947317 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5947318 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5947319 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5947320 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5947321 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5947322 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5947323 are you gonna set an agenda of change or one of compromise of what the republican minority is gonna allow you to do in the congress
5947324 e ven if we do well theres still gonna be almost half the country that votes for somebody else so one of the things that we have to understand is that theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are and my core principles are that im fighting for ordinary americans to make sure that they can live out their american dream and i am fighting to make sure that our values and ideals enshrined in our constitution and our declaration of independence are upheld
5947325 winning elections and governing in america is a complex undertaking and it takes some recognition that most of the country is more moderate
5947326 more people identify themselves as moderates than either liberal or conservative i think hes a moderate but a liberal moderate and hes not running as an ideologue which i think is important i do think though he has to sharpen his message so that those moderates are comfortable with his values
5947327 hes changed the emphasis in which he talks about things hes in for a hard fight and there are large swatches of the country that are waiting to see if hes pretty close to them in terms of values this hasnt been easy for democrats to do theres a reason democrats have lost seven out of the last 10 elections for president withobama youve seen an emphasis on things like faith based initiatives which have always been part of his platform but wasnt a major emphasis in the primary campaign
5947328 theres always been this tension about whether you run a populist campaign geared towards middle class voters their needs their angers
5947329 or do you run a moderate dlc democratic leadership council model the truth is weve come out of this hybrid of the two
5947330 he has to show people who dont live in seattle or new york city that hes real
5947331 campaigns arent about issues theyre about emotions raw emotions and he has to spend a lot of time speaking to people in the middle of america he has to broaden his voice
5947332 i remind a lot of democrats who didnt vote for al gore because he wasnt liberal enough that we got george bush
5947333 how did that help the liberal cause al gore would not have gotten us into iraq and he wouldnt have appointed supreme court justices like johnalito and john roberts i am not one of those who sits back and says youre either 100 percent with us or youre against us it doesnt make sense obama might be something you might not like to win in pennsylvania or somewhere else governing is more important than purity youve got to keep your ideals but you have to be a realist
5947334 you ran great guns in the campaign it was an insurgency boy a sight to see and then you drove to the middle of the road the moment after you took the oath just the middle of the road nothing but a long line painted yellow i wanted to retire five years ago but i waited for a democrat i wanted a democrat hmmph and instead i got you
5947335 if you look at where the american people are were where the american people are on issue after issue after issue
5947336 whether its getting responsibly out of iraq or forming an energy independence plan i think sen obamas where the american public is
5947337 democrats are two three times more energized about their nominee than republicans are about theirs the great thing is that the base wants change and independents in this country want change as a matter of fact moderate republicans want change i think were fortunate that we have a message that carries across all of those platforms
5947338 theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are
5947339 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
5947340 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5947341 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5947342 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5947343 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5947344 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5947345 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5947346 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5947347 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5947348 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
5947349 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
5947350 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5947351 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5947352 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5947353 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5947354 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5947355 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5947356 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5947357 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5947358 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5947359 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5947360 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5947361 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5947362 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5947363 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5947364 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5947365 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5947366 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5947367 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5947368 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5947369 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5947370 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5947371 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5947372 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5947373 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5947374 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5947375 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5947376 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5947377 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5947378 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5947379 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5947380 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5947381 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5947382 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5947383 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5947384 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5947385 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5947386 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5947387 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5947388 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5947389 oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or federal revenue
5947390 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5947391 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5947392 if in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics
5947393 my mothers a great woman she can really take a punch
5947394 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
5947395 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5947396 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5947397 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
5947398 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
5947399 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
5947400 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
5947401 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
5947402 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
5947403 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
5947404 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
5947405 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world
5947406 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5947407 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5947408 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5947409 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5947410 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5947411 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5947412 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5947413 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5947414 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5947415 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5947416 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5947417 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5947418 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5947419 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5947420 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5947421 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5947422 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5947423 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5947424 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5947425 se bloquear en la guardia en portachuelo y otros puntos m s
5947426 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5947427 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5947428 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5947429 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5947430 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5947431 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5947432 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5947433 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5947434 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5947435 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5947436 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5947437 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5947438 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5947439 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5947440 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5947441 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5947442 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5947443 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5947444 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5947445 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5947446 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5947447 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5947448 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5947449 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5947450 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5947451 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5947452 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5947453 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5947454 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5947455 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5947456 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5947457 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5947458 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5947459 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5947460 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5947461 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5947462 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5947463 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5947464 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5947465 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5947466 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5947467 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5947468 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5947469 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5947470 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5947471 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5947472 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5947473 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5947474 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5947475 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5947476 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5947477 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5947478 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5947479 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5947480 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5947481 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5947482 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5947483 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5947484 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5947485 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5947486 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5947487 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5947488 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5947489 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5947490 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5947491 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5947492 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5947493 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5947494 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5947495 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5947496 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5947497 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5947498 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5947499 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5947500 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5947501 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5947502 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5947503 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5947504 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5947505 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5947506 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5947507 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5947508 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5947509 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5947510 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5947511 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5947512 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5947513 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5947514 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5947515 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5947516 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5947517 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5947518 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5947519 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5947520 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5947521 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5947522 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5947523 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5947524 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5947525 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5947526 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5947527 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5947528 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5947529 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5947530 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5947531 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5947532 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5947533 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5947534 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5947535 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5947536 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5947537 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5947538 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5947539 they told me there are going to be resources here
5947540 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5947541 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5947542 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5947543 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5947544 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5947545 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5947546 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5947547 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5947548 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
5947549 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com
5947550 were thrilled to partner with drgreene com the most trusted online source for childrens health and the leading online community of parents seeking to raise their children in healthy and sustainable households
5947551 dr greene who has been called the al gore of pediatrics has created a thriving community of parents seeking to educate themselves on health and parenting issues to make better choices for their children his advice combines practical wisdom warm empathy a deep respect for parents children and the environment and will provide our marketing partners with the premium online brand for childrens health and parenting the combination of drgreene com and our other moms and family channel sites gives us a targeted highly effective way to engage this affluent and influential audience
5947552 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5947553 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5947554 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5947555 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5947556 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5947557 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5947558 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5947559 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5947560 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5947561 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5947562 tell me what it is this isnt about t boone pickens it isnt about democrats and republicans this ones about america
5947563 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5947564 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5947565 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5947566 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5947567 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5947568 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5947569 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5947570 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
5947571 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
5947572 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
5947573 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
5947574 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
5947575 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
5947576 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
5947577 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5947578 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5947579 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5947580 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5947581 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5947582 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5947583 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5947584 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5947585 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5947586 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5947587 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5947588 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5947589 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5947590 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5947591 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5947592 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5947593 telling you only half of the twin peaks mall story
5947594 is really talking out of both sides of ones mouth at the council meeting there
5947595 the video shown at the august 12th meeting again as clearly stated was the
5947596 does not prevent this future option but what it allows us to do is to study that as a future option what it also allows us to do is study a hundred other future options
5947597 anyone remember that it was just that a portion of new sales tax generated by the ura would not be collected by the city the contradictions throughout her recent comments are staggering
5947598 was mentioned by councilmembers gabe santos and mary blue along these lines yet the most obvious
5947599 erik is off a very good high school football team
5947600 we hope he can come in right away and compete for us
5947601 tom is one of the top offensive lineman off the rangeview high school team
5947602 he will be a guy that can come in an play right away
5947603 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years

5947611 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue

5947620 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5947621 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5947622 i am married to the next president of the united states
5947623 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5947624 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5947625 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5947626 if you photographers are looking for brad pitt im not the guy
5947627 when is mccain going to pick his vp he did already who governor paul enty pffft

5947629 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
5947630 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside sen barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5947631 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5947632 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5947633 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5947634 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5947635 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5947636 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5947637 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5947638 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

5947645 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5947646 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5947647 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5947648 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5947649 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5947654 people dont usually think about these types of cells when they talk about human embryonic stem cell therapy but it is important
5947655 theres more infections all the time and the number of donors is more and more limited
5947656 whether they would be good enough for transfusion is very unclear
5947657 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
5947658 healthcare costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
5947659 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
5947660 in general ive found that the people who struggle the most with weight issues have the poorest mind body communication when they learn to speak and interpret their bodys language their physiology finally starts cooperating with their conscious wishes

5947663 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
5947664 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5947665 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5947666 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue

5947880 some of the banking stocks have taken a major hit and they have come to the lower support levels that is one space which could pull one up with support from some of the capital goods stocks
5947881 one standout sector probably could be realty sector which is underowned and people are very bearish on that i think that could also give one a smarter bounce from here for example unitech has already come up to rs 165 i do not mind buying this between rs 165 and rs 156 for a target stretching up to around rs 190 or even dlf which has come to about rs 490 now it has fallen by about rs 90 from the top so that is also in a band of about rs 488 and rs 460 for a reversal target of rs 550 590 that is one sector i am positive on apart from sugar so these two sectors i would try to play long apart from the banks
5947882 i saw the flash coming at about rs 674 for icici bank rs 669 is the immediate support and it is falling from about rs 779 so that will be about rs 110 drop about 15 drop i think it could rally from the current levels from rs 670 levels only if it goes below that then we will see rs 620 i think in banking one is not going to have a singular stock which is going to lead the rally i think it is going to be a composite structure the entire sector would rally together so i would not try to pick up one single stock from there

5947888 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5947889 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5947890 true we never have all the facts when doing a case study but it is instructive to imagine ourselves as the executives and board members in a situation and ask ourselves what obvious mistakes we seem to have made what might have been the extenuating circumstances and whether we should really be forgiven for the mistake even given those imagined constraints
5947891 its nice to have fast growing companies but if you cant buy them at the right price it doesnt make sense

5947917 its important to understand what the program is designed to do and how much flexibility the degree offers
5947918 a caution i throw out for undergraduates is that they spend four years with a degree with the word sports in it and 10 years later they dont want to do sports anymore that degree wont be as flexible
5947919 five years ago many thought if they got a degree in sport management that was their ticket to work in professional sports in the four major sports leagues football baseball basketball hockey
5947920 but now they realize that those jobs are few and far between and the turnover is small

5947960 to be honest there just arent top quality men here
5947961 they are too busy drinking xxxx to notice the women and all they do is whistle or yell or beep as you go past those sorts of communication skills which i just love
5947962 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd

5947965 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5947966 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5947967 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5947968 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5947969 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5947970 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5947971 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5947972 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5947973 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5947974 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened

5947992 everybody worked together so well everybody did their jobs everything just worked i really think that us learning each other and me learning the bike and what it takes to be a championship contending team has come together for us
5947993 like everybody we wish wed qualified higher but it actually worked out in our favor where we qualified we had a good side of the ladder with some of the really tough competitors going out early not that anybodys not a tough competitor anymore because every single person in the other lane feels like a final round these days but there were bikes that were faster than some of the ones i had to race and they went out early so that was a little bit less stressful
5947994 we had a plan on sunday to win as many rounds as we could and keep our nose to the grindstone
5947995 we kept having things go wrong but we kept fighting and fighting and kept going rounds
5947996 every time i turned around angelle was looking down and not watching im proud of her for that she made everybody nervous all day when they raced her
5947997 we rolled up to the starting line against matt for the d j vu final
5947998 and i said real loud so everybody could hear me if it starts up well be better than last week it fired and everybody smiled
5947999 if it hadnt started i believe lou and jeremy pringle and terry daniels of rush racing would have called me into their office first thing monday morning
5948000 we went 6 95 first round then we tuned and it slowed down
5948001 we said ok that didnt work and went back the other way and it slowed down again usually when you go back to where you were it picks back up so there might be something wrong with that motor were gonna take it all apart and make sure its ready for indy were gonna run two engines there instead of one like we did at brainerd and reading ken johnson is taking the bike and engines back to the shop were gonna work on them and come out as best we can for the u s nationals
5948002 we were losing power every round and matt smith is just one heck of a competitor its gonna take a lot to take him down but i do believe we have it
5948003 she left on matt rode straight and shifted on time which is all we can ask im very proud to be able to go to two finals in a row going to these finals is right what we were trying to do id like to win every race but peaking when it counts is a good thing its typical of our race team to peak towards the end of the year
5948004 i think everybody gave their all and there wasnt anything else we could have done its just the way the cards fell im very proud of my guys
5948005 and i want to say a big thank you to our sponsors and family at rush racing
5948006 were fourth in the world in points and i think we can move into third after indy
5948007 and if we keep going the way were going i think well be there the teams starting to really come together i want to qualify number one at indy win the ringers gloves battle and win the u s nationals
5948008 i really thought we were gonna get our first win of the year but we didnt and i am totally motivated and so ready to go to indy because i think our team is on a roll and its all gonna fall into place just at the right time
5948009 we made a huge move up to fourth in points and things are falling right where we want them to fall when the countdown starts and we are gonna be contenders im excited about it matt smith is not gonna be the only thorn in everybodys side
5948010 that would make it the fastest moving operating system ever

5948021 a man who has once perceived however temporarily and however briefly what makes greatness of soul can no longer be happy if he allows himself to be petty self seeking troubled by trivial misfortunes dreading what fate may have in store for him the man capable of greatness of soul will open wide the windows of his mind letting the winds blow freely upon it from every portion of the universe he will see himself and life and the world as truly as our human limitations will permit realizing the brevity and minuteness of human life he will realize also that in individual minds is concentrated whatever of value the known universe contains and he will see that the man whose mind mirrors the world becomes in a sense as great as the world in emancipation from the fears that beset the slave of circumstance he will experience a profound joy and through all the vicissitudes of his outward life he will remain in the depths of his being a happy man

5948068 whenever a christian movement comes along that presents itself as reformist it should not be summarily dismissed
5948069 so busy telling us how culture has changed that their response has offered very little critique to the changes it vehemently denounces modernism but offers nothing very penetrating when it comes to postmodernism in particular it has wrestled unconvincingly with the related matters of truth certainty historical witness and even the nature of the gospel itself
5948070 if emerging church leaders wish to become a long term prophetic voice that produces fruit that does not drift off towards progressive sectarianism and even in the worst instances outright heresy they must listen at least as carefully to criticisms of their movement as they transparently want others to listen to them
5948071 i have to say as kindly but as forcefully as i can that to my mind if words mean anything both mclaren and chalke have largely abandoned the gospel perhaps their rhetoric and enthusiasm have led them astray and they will prove willing to reconsider their published judgements on these matters and embrace biblical truth more holistically than they have been doing in their most recent works but if not i cannot see how their own words constitute anything less than a drift towards abandoning the gospel

5948076 we picked up the swimsuit in a store in miami it was really small and itsy bitsy so we picked up two and prasad designer manish malhotra s tailor sewed them together to make a one piece right there on the location
5948077 the choice of the swimsuits gold colour reminiscent of ursula andresss in dr no and bo dereks in 10 was a coincidence she said
5948078 we settled for gold because my skin is dusky and a perfect foil for the colour

5948080 the loss will cross over rs 250 million in the short term unless adequate remedial measures are initiated by the actor who has immensely benefited out of our labours in the past we were taken for a ride by the producers who claimed it was a full length rajnikant film which it was not

5948090 what roof the damage was never at your condo its outside we werent at the roof at all

5948092 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5948093 im advocating a serious dialogue about what were doing whether its working or not and if there are other things we can do to be more effective
5948094 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5948095 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5948096 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5948097 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5948098 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5948099 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5948100 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5948101 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5948102 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5948103 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5948104 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5948105 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5948106 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5948115 the project from the usa entitled modelling the toxic effects of silver nanoparticles under varying environmental conditions is the winner of the 2008 stockholm junior water prize for discovering the potential toxicity of silver nanoparticles this is a new hardly investigated category of micropollutants which are commonly used in industry for a variety of purposes these particles are then released into the environment including water bodies without proper knowledge of their fate and potential toxicity the remarkable level of scientific research takes steps towards understanding and quantifying the potential environmental consequences and risks of their use this study repudiates the assertion that silver nanoparticles are more reliable and less environmentally hazardous than silver ions this initial research questions the reliability of their use in consumer products the scientific impact of this investigation is extremely profound and we expect that it will open the door to serious questioning and further studies regarding the widespread use of silver nanoparticles

5948143 vision plays a major role in language and social emotional development
5948144 we are trying a slightly different approach this year we are holding a one day security summit in singapore on the friday before simply because our asian audience doesnt want to travel to sydney and our sydney office doesnt want to travel to singapore
5948145 each of these markets has different priorities so in certain categories for example in london identity management is big stuff we tend to feature more on identity management topics
5948146 in australia we tend to have more of a comprehensive coverage of security but with a practical focus
5948147 there is a similar focus in singapore but because they are not cutting edge adopters gartner needs to go into a lot of issues there is not as much of technology focus each place is somewhat different
5948148 the top issue at the sydney summit is data security in general its a high line issue for everyone weve seen a lot of very public data security failures over the past couple of years part of thats due to the breach disclosure laws of the us making it impossible to hide these things anymore
5948149 we havent seen that much happening here in australia but that doesnt mean it hasnt been going on being a security person i assume that these terrible things are happening here but no body talks about them but i might be wrong maybe were not
5948150 data security in general is a big issue primarily because its showing up the limitations of a purely technological approach to security
5948151 it is a necessary part of a security program but it has to be coupled with good education programs with compliance programs and with the things that work on user behaviour
5948152 our more mature clients particularly in the australian area now have personnel that are permanently deployed in business divisions as employees to work on security risk to liaise with the business to interpret policy and figure out the best way to do business in a secure fashion which is a good sign of maturity it means that security is moving out of the back room and becoming just a normal part of risk management in a normal business
5948153 most definitely in fact were featuring a number of talks on identity management identity and access management are the bedrock of most security infrastructure and process use its simply fundamental at the same time companies can often get it wrong
5948154 particularly as users require more and more transparency and identity management protocol they dont want to carry three different security tokens and have five different passwords and so forth
5948155 companies are looking for a more seamless interaction with systems so thats motivated a constant chase on the part of the security professionals to find a better way to do things and that doesnt necessarily need technology sometimes its process
5948156 its finding that right blend of human behaviour and technological systems to provide the user with seamless security identity and access management is critical of that
5948157 managing security compliance and risk is a higher end portion of the summit its looking at the issues of how you actually manage a risk program how do you build security as a business topic and how do you integrate it to your other operational risk business risk technological risk and management strategies so its much more about management of functions
5948158 im bringing in an analyst who specialises to a certain extend in that area neil mcdonald cloud computing is becoming a big phrase but weve been talking about computing in the cloud for 15 years
5948159 theres still a big debate about what it exactly means and the taxonomy definitely gets confused because different vendors come up with their own interpretations of what it means so theres not a single definition
5948160 im nervous about cloud computing and i tend to want to specify aspects of it so software as a service is an example of a cloud computing implementation and that sort of issue will come up a lot when looking at in many of the talks
5948161 were actually looking at things like how do we provide security for software as a service or if youre outsourcing storage to data centres all over the world how do you actually secure your data in that environment
5948162 i get a little tired of the marketing fight over who owns the concept lets get on with the business of security and not worry too much
5948163 we will be discussing virtualisation in a very practical sense in terms of how do you provide security assurance in a world consumed with virtualised servers virtual desktops and so forth
5948164 neil mcdonald takes a very refreshing look at the impact of virtualisation and how we can still provide security in fact how we can enhance security through use of virtualisation we see it as an opportunity for applying virtual security infrastructure not just as a server
5948165 ill be speaking about some of the issues around the virtual environments social status such as facebook and their impact on security in businesses we have several businesses in australian who are making greater and greater use of these sorts of environments go
5948166 furthermore as petrol prices fluctuate as cost of transport fluctuates more and more businesses are starting to look at the idea of remote business
5948167 there is a lot exploration and experimentation in that space we need to look at how do we secure this and how do we provide a confidential platform for that kind of interaction

5948179 its great news theres a lot of history here and there were another couple of clubs who were trying to lay claim to the title but the racecourse beats them both by more than 20 years
5948180 i spent a couple of months researching how to put a case to guinness and eventually wrote to them
5948181 they said i needed to prove that the venue was still being used for internationals and because there werent any scheduled i had to write to the football association of wales to ask for their support
5948182 i got a letter back confirming that they will be playing senior internationals there in the future
5948183 that was all that was needed and guinness confirmed everything a couple of months later
5948184 we were contacted a few months ago by lifelong wrexham fan glyn davies who believed the racecourse ground to be the oldest international football ground
5948185 today after receiving confirmation from the faw that the racecourse will still be used for senior international matches we are delighted to confirm that the racecourse is indeed the holder of the guinness world record for oldest international football ground
5948186 this is a wonderful achievement to have confirmed by guinness world records and i congratulate glyn davies on his excellent detective work in establishing the record as being correct

5948303 if the banks fail to pass on an official rate cut as they should then there are a number of options open to the federal government particularly when were looking at the market and the extent to which it is competitive
5948304 but im not going to flag them in advance i expect them to do the right thing
5948305 i have been very puzzled as to why this debate erupted in the first place
5948306 there is no better way to completely destroy your credibility than to make threats you cant carry out
5948307 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery
5948308 a lot of these technologies that will be living on the periphery like wimax are going to be pretty battery hungry
5948309 their overall story about the increasing graphics intensity running on our desktops i think thats absolutely true
5948310 the vision they have there in terms of how they think that will all converge is credible to me
5948311 very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
5948312 in established markets like europe and the united states where we have established ways of using computers im not convinced something like the mid device will really take off
5948313 something small that can that can be held in the hand a tool used to assess if something is true
5948314 the whole anthrax case would make for a good journalism class
5948315 if youre editing this for mother jones do you run the feature without a quote or link where obama offers the comparison
5948316 prominent thinkers and writers ponder obama and his claim that his campaign is comparable to the great progressive movements in u s history
5948317 my campaign is a movement comparable to the great progressive movements in history
5948318 is barack obama exaggerating when he compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in us history
5948319 compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in us history
5948320 claim that his campaign is comparable to the great progressive movements in u s history
5948321 here is one advantage bloggers have in the struggle for reputation for the users trust they are closer to the transaction where trust gets built up on the web theres a big difference between tapping a built up asset like the st pete times brand and creating it from scratch
5948322 you dont own the eyeballs you dont own the press which is now divided into pro and amateur zones you dont control production on the new platform which isnt one way theres a new balance of power between you and us
5948323 howard weaver vice president for news at the mcclatchy company said it comes as close as anything ive seen to a roadmap for the near future
5948324 just so you know the media has no mind it cannot make decisions which means it does not get behind candidates it does not decide to oppose your guy or gal it is a beast without a brain most of the time it doesnt know what its doing
5948325 im just advising newsroom joe and jill make room for fdl in your own ideas about whats coming on news wise dont let your own formula blog opinion fake you out a conspiracy of the like minded to find out what happened when the national news media isnt inclined to tell us might be way more practical than you think
5948326 were at the twilight of the curmudgeon class in newsrooms and j schools though they can still do a lot of damage you know theyre giving up when they no longer bother to inform themselves about what they themselves say is happening
5948327 the important thing is to show integrity not to be a neuter politically and having good facts that hold up is a bigger advantage than claiming to reflect all sides equally well
5948328 enterprise reporting goes pro am assignments are open sourced they begin online reporters working with smart users and blogging editors get the story the pack wouldnt couldnt or didnt
5948329 newassignment net just launched its first reporting project a partnership with wired com and newsvine its called assignment zero heres the deal and the links
5948330 a highly satisfying failure jeff howe called it in wired no a spectacularly successful failure says beth lawton at the digital edge meanwhile offthebus net launched this week carrying the lessons of zero into political space
5948331 here are my coordinates for the territory we need to be searching i got them from doing a distributed trend story with wired com and thinking through the results
5948332 this white house doesnt settle for managing the news what used to be called feeding the beast because there is a larger aim to roll back the press as a player within the executive branch to make it less important in running the white house and governing the country
5948333 youre assuming that you represent the public i dont accept that
5948334 bush and his advisors have their own press think which they are trying out as policy reporters do not represent the interests of a broader public they arent a pipeline to the people because people see through the game of gotcha the press has forfeited if it ever had its quasi official role in the checks and balances of government
5948335 savviness that quality of being shrewd practical well informed perceptive ironic with it and unsentimental in all things political is in a sense their professional religion they make a cult of it and it was this cult that karl rove understood and exploited for political gain
5948336 were headed i think for schism tumult and divide as the religion of the american press meets the upheavals in global politics and public media that are well underway changing around us are the terms on which authority can be established by journalists the net is opening things up shifting the power to publish around consumers are becoming producers readers can be writers
5948337 some of the pressure the blogs are putting on journalists shows up then in the demand for
5948338 theyre not equals but washington and arlington have their own spheres over the newspaper and reporting beats len downie is king over the website jim brady is sovereign over the user s experience no one has total control theres tension because theres supposed to be tension
5948339 an industry that wont move until it is certain of days as good as its golden past is effectively dead from a strategic point of view besides there is an alternative if you dont have the faith or will or courage needed to accept reality and deal the alternative is to drive the property to a profitable demise
5948340 so while people in the old press pack up and tell stories about giants they knew in the era when they are also asking each other where headed
5948341 mcclellan bush cheney and rove proved there were other ways
5948342 woodward and bernstein of 1972 74 didnt have such access and this probably influenced for the better their view of what nixon and his men were capable of watergate wasnt broken by reporters who had entree to the inner corridors of power it was two guys on the metro desk
5948343 just one mans opinion but now is a good time to say it the new york times is not any longer in my mind the greatest newspaper in the land nor is it the base line for the public narrative that it once was some time in the last year or so i moved the washington post into that position
5948344 this here is a post for practically everyone in the game of seizing on media bias and denouncing it which is part of our popular culture and of course a loud part of our politics and this is especially for the were fair and balanced youre not crowd wherever i may have located you
5948345 the posts links dont expire you see links to the new york times do
5948346 oreilly feeds off his own resentments the establishment sneering at inside edition and like howard beale the mad prophet of the airwaves his resentments are enlarged by the medium into public grievances among a mass of americans unfairly denied voice
5948347 dan rather and cbs took the risky course impunging the motives of critics rather than a more confident and honorable one lets look at our sources and methods what can explain such a blind reaction here is my attempt
5948348 occupy the reasonable middle between two markers for vocal critic and critics look ridiculous charging you with bias their symmetrical existence feels like proof of an underlying hysteria their mutually incompatible charges seem to cancel each other out the minute evidence they marshall even shows a touch of fanaticism
5948349 among foreign correspondents there is a phrase parachuting in thats when a reporter drops into foreign territory during an emergency without much preparation staying only as long as the story remains big the high profile people who might parachute in are called bigfoots in the jargon of network news the problem with being a bigfoot of course is that its hard to walk in other peoples shoes
5948350 the bias charges are getting more serious lately as the stakes rise in iraq and the election but there is something lacking in press coverage and it may be time for wise journalists to assess it the re building story has gone missing and without it how can we judge the job bush is doing
5948351 there are hidden moral hazards in the ethic of neutral observation and the belief in a professional role that transcends other loyalties i think there is an abyss to observation alone and i feel it has something to do with why more people dont trust journalists they dont trust that abyss
5948352 find some new information and put it into your post
5948353 opinion based on information everyone has is less valuable than opinion journalism based on information that you dug up originated or pieced together so its not important to us that contributors keep opinion
5948354 what capacity for product development do news organizations show zip how are they on nurturing innovation terrible is there an entreprenurial spirit in newsrooms no do smart young people ever come in and overturn everything never
5948355 number one is the houston chronicle number two the washington post theres more and theres a big chart so check it out more
5948356 i think the happiest conference goers at blogher were probably the newbies people who want to start blogging or just did they got a lot of good information and advice some of the best information was actually dispensed in response to the fears provoked by blogging which shouldn t be avoided the sages said but examined turned around defused and creatively shrunk
5948357 the weblog comes out of the gift economy whereas most of today s journalism comes out of the market economy
5948358 the quality of any weblog in journalism depends greatly on its fidelity to age old newsroom commandments like check facts check links spell things correctly be accurate be timely quote fairly
5948359 sure weblogs are good for making statements big and small but they also force re statement yes theyre opinion forming but they are equally good at unforming opinion breaking it down stretching it out
5948360 when youre sitting at your desk and there are things strange wonderful and new on your screen you may have to re decide what journalism is and is finally about in order to cover the new class of cases that arise when youre doing it live online
5948361 its pirate radio legalized its public access coming closer to life inside the borders of blogistan a real place with all the problems of a real place were closer to a vision of producer democracy than we are to any of the consumerist views that long ago took hold in the mass media including much of the journalism presented on that platform
5948362 and big media doesnt entirely own the press because if it did then the first amendment which mentions the press would belong to big media and it doesnt these things were always true the weblog doesnt change them it just opens up an outlet to the sea which in turn extends the press to the desk in the bedroom of the suburban mom where she blogs at night
5948363 journalists think good information leads to opinion and argument its a logical sequence bloggers think that good argument and strong opinion cause people to seek information an equally logical sequence what do the bloggers bring to this my short answer to the press is everything you have removed
5948364 journalists you can stop worrying about bloggers replacing the traditional news media were grist for their mill says satullo a mill that doesnt run without us bloggers consume and extend the shelf life of our reporting and they scrutinize it at a new level of intensity
5948365 the web is good for many opposite things for quick hitting information for clicking across a field for talk and interaction its also a depth finder a memory device a library an editor not to use a weblog for extended analysis because most users wont pick that option is web dumb but media smart whats strange is that i try to write short snappy things but they turn into long ones
5948366 i remember the moment when presidential campaigns turned from just maddening and absurd to completely empty for me it might have happened years before but i am a believer in politics so it took until the fall of 2000 bush and gore were then fighting it out not by opposing one another in any kind of argument but by running virtually the same campaign on the same issues pandering to the same groups advancing a rhetoric that sounded the same but for a few catch phrases
5948367 somehow it had all gotten away from them presidential campaigns had drifted out of alignment with most americans the ritual no longer seemed like something the country did for itself every four years but what a professional cadre did and sold back to the country as politics but it wasn t really at least it wasn t democratic politics at anything like capacity
5948368 were winning to somehow be removed or retired as the operating system for news campaign reporting would immediately become harder to do not because there would be no news but rather no common repeatable instructions for deciding what is a key development in the story a turning point a surprise a trend master narratives are thus harder to alter than they are to apprehend for how do you keep the story running while a switch is made
5948369 spin alley an invention of the american press and politicos shows that the system we have is in certain ways a partnership between the press and insiders in politics they come together to mount the ritual an intelligent nation is entitled to ask if the partners are engaged in public service when they bring to life their invention alternative thesis they are in a pact of mutual convenience that serves no intelligible public good
5948370 how is it you know youre the press because you have a pass that says press and people open the gate the locker room doors admit you
5948371 the answer i think involves an open secret in political journalism that has been recognized for at least 20 years but it is never dealt with probably because the costs of facing it head on seem larger than the light tax on honesty any open secret demands the secret is this pssst the press is a player in the campaign and even though it knows this as everyone knows it the professional code of the journalist contains no instructions in what the press could or should be playing for
5948372 i think its a bankrupt form it serves no clear purpose has no sensible rationale the journalists who offer us strategy news do not know what public service they are providing why they are providing it for whom it is intended or how we are supposed to use this strange variety of news
5948373 when journalists avoid drawing open conclusions they are more vulnerable to charges of covert bias of having a concealed agenda of not being up front about their perspective of unfairly building a case for against while pretending only to report what happened
5948374 no one knows what a political convention actually is anymore or why it takes 15 000 people to report on it two successive regimes for making sense of the event have collapsed a third has not emerged thats a good starting point for the webloggers credentialed in boston no investment in the old regime and its ironizing
5948375 nobody had ever asked to anchor convention coverage from the floor feist said as we shared a booth like real diners cnn got the new gear tested it out and made the request to the democrats the democrats said yes and right there the sky box era at conventions came to an end
5948376 journalists find before them with 50 days left a campaign overtaken by vietnam by character issues attacks and fights about the basic legitimacy of various actors including the press itself including dan rather its been a dark week and the big arrow is pointing backwards
5948377 the every four years headset is like outdated software still running because its an expensive decision and major disruption to replace a piece of press think so big with so many parts there is no agreement on a new think system and there is every incentive to keep the old program going for another election cycle even though the world has moved on
5948378 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just it is an honour for france and its army to defend it
5948379 regardless of what i think of too human as an action rpg theres no denying that it contains some of the most memorable writing in a computer game since richter barged in on dracula and was told something about a man being a miserable pile of secrets

5948392 we cannot succeed in afghanistan or secure america as long as there is a terrorist safe haven in northwest pakistan a year ago i said that we must take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act
5948393 mccain criticised me and claimed i was for bombing our ally he refused to join my call to take out laden across the afghan border and instead spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5948394 the departure of president musharraf has given the us an opportunity to move away from a foreign policy focused on one person to a pakistan policy
5948395 ive co sponsored a bill to triple non military aid to the pakistani people while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban
5948396 ending the war in iraq will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in pak afghan border region this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5948397 with his overwhelming focus on iraq mccain argued that we could just muddle through in afghanistan and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month
5948398 ive called for at least two additional us combat brigades and an additional 1 billion in non military assistance for afghanistan with a demand for more action from its government

5948403 jesus never condemned a pharisee for taking moses too seriously
5948404 if you believed moses you would believe me for he write of me but if you dont believe his writings how will you believe my words your accuser is moses
5948405 foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith preached the gospel beforehand to abraham saying
5948406 the scriptures should be read with the aim of finding christ in them whoever turns aside from this object even though he wears himself out all his life in learning he will never reach the knowledge of the truth
5948407 i am all poverty as well as all guilt having nothing of my own with which to repay thee but i bring jesus to thee in the arms of faith pleading his righteousness to offset my iniquities rejoicing that he will weigh down the scales for me and satisfy thy justice i bless thee that great sin draws out great grace that although the lest sin deserves infinite punishment because done against an infinite god yet there is mercy for me for where guilt is most terrible there thy mercy in christ is most free and deep

5948487 i hope the london bus will be a new symbol of shimonoseki
5948488 at first i wondered if the london bus would suit the city but now i can tell its well suited to the retro look of the city
5948489 the bus was tough to drive because it has its own style
5948490 but driving the london bus is a lot of fun as people wave their hands to us with a big smile which had never happened before in my career
5948491 it was so scary as the roof is high so the balance can shift really easily but im used to it i hope it will top the tourists list in shimonoseki
5948492 yeah but that was like a year ago thank you

5948498 it is so depressing shares are getting whacked by margin calls just as liquidity dries up
5948499 with the lifting of the curb any whiff of bad news will send us financials reeling this puts pressure on regional blue chips like dbs group holdings because hedge funds have to liquidate positions here to plug us losses
5948500 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract

5948503 at the restaurant i also like to add fava beans i like their bright color and they add protein
5948504 i sense that people who use these phones for such purposes dont appreciate the seriousness of the communication
5948505 charges of threatening to kill attract a maximum of seven years imprisonment and it matters little how that threat is communicated its the effect of the threat on the person who receives it
5948506 people who are in the habit of using cellphones and texts to alarm and annoy others need to appreciate that the consequences can be very serious indeed
5948507 new zealanders are gripped and excited by our sporting success
5948508 we like to see ourselves on top of the world but we cant expect to keep doing it on the cheap

5948513 i dont believe it i think winston has lost all credibility and he is making up a new story every day to fit the facts
5948514 the nsgs meeting a day after tomorrow will be a negotiating session and what weve said is that we are not setting out to be needlessly obstructionist
5948515 we acknowledge that india does have a good track record of non proliferation but nevertheless it remains outside of the npt it has developed tested and possesses nuclear weapons
5948516 what we would like to see ideally are a range of conditions which would apply to india if the exemption is given
5948517 we dont think that anything we are asking for is unreasonable
5948518 were not trying to obstruct indias ability to receive supplies of material and technology for a civilian nuclear capacity and therefore should not be objectionable to either india or the us
5948519 we come from the angle of being a country that believes strongly in trying to entrench non proliferation
5948520 the sorts of things we are talking about would give us greater confidence that the net result of the exemption would be supportive of non proliferation rather than damaging to it
5948521 our much preferred position in any organisation where there is a consensus decision making process would be to stand alongside other countries speaking about shared concerns rather than holding a position that was isolated from all the others

5948533 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5948534 theres a great incentive because theres that much attention focused on them and they become interested in looking better and in no time they just shed it
5948535 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down

5948560 sends a clear message that current western strategy in afghanistan is failing
5948561 until now western leaders have been in denial about the true extent of taliban presence in afghanistan and their ability to move swiftly on the afghan capital
5948562 a new troop deployment is required simply to secure the capital
5948563 with the taliban on the very doorstep of the afghan capital the situation can only get worse for nato isaf forces and for the afghan people
5948564 im not ready to declare any sort of new strategy
5948565 so i have a job to do a job to complete

5948567 usain was one of the athletes we recruited in 2003 he was just a young 16 year old kid and hes progressed quite well
5948568 i ran for finn valley athletic club i was the captain there for many years i guess i was a good club runner in ireland got a couple of irish vests at under 23 level and student level but no championships like this
5948569 its hard work we work long hours but when you cant be a professional in the sport yourself i guess this is the next best thing
5948570 in 2002 when he was 15 years old he won the world junior championships he raced more at 200 metres prior to this this year he got strong enough hes been in the gym a little bit more and hes been quite successful
5948571 hes a typical jamaican i think very laid back very very laid back in the warm up area before the 100 metres we were punching each other rolling on the ground he was laughing he loves playing games hes a young at heart kind of guy
5948572 hes a happy guy what you see on the track is real when you see him serious you know that something is wrong

5948574 ncbs sponsorship of al qaeda flowed largely although not exclusively through muwafaq foundation
5948575 plaintiffs offer only speculation and hearsay in their effort to link ncb to al qaeda terrorists who committed the sept 11 attacks
5948576 mr kadis actions and those of his muwafaq foundation and businesses give rise to a reasonable basis to believe that they have facilitated terrorist activities
5948577 there is little doubt that a financial conduit to bin laden was handled through the national commercial bank

5948581 if the agreement was reached because of georgia this strengthens russias argument that the shield is against russia even though the americans say its not if its not against russia then why was the agreement reached so fast with the georgian conflict going on
5948582 this is it this is the only family ive got
5948583 the united states does not seek to isolate russia the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states when you start invading small neighbours
5948584 it seems like nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and paint white a criminal regime they are trying to save a collapsing government and want to rearm the current leaders of georgia

5948594 it will not be moved from pakistan i am not even willing to answer any questions to that effect
5948595 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5948596 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5948597 our information is specific to being in an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5948598 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up

5948611 im not touting privatization of the whole health system nobody wants an american style health system least of all the cma
5948612 we must have a universal health system but it has to be accessible and responsive
5948613 the system isnt perfect but its working it shows the benefits of a good private public mix

5948616 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
5948617 we did establish a fixed date for the next election
5948618 the fact of the matter what we will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament
5948619 its not my job to go into an election because the prime minister asked me to go into an election my job is to replace him and timing is important

5948624 la serie ha sido m s re ida que la de ayer
5948625 las sensaciones son muy buenas de manera que hay que ir a por el oro en las dos pruebas porque si sales a quedar segundo o tercero seguro que no lo consigues
5948626 es un competidor de mucho coraz n agresivo veloz y ambicioso
5948627 yo trabajo para no sacar el mpetu para trabajar el punto y provocar al contrario trabajo
5948628 para ponerle nervioso con mis fintas pero las cosas son as soy veloz y agresivo y nunca he sentido m s presi n que la que me pongo a m mismo
5948629 en esto no hay miedo al contrincante sino a la derrota pierdes y te vas a la calle siempre tengo nervios siempre descargo adrenalina no me gustan pero las cosas son as intento no pensar en el campeonato que no me suban las pulsaciones
5948630 arriba en el tapiz est s solo te puede guiar el coach y la gente que est arriba pero el que se tiene que dar cuenta el que tiene que resolver los problemas eres t hay veces que no escuchas nada porque est s muy metido agresivo cuando est s m s tranquilo en asaltos m s t cticos ah s que escuchas algo al p blico
5948631 est supermotivado el sorteo ha sido duro pero ah estaremos porque l tiene 32 a os y sabe que es su gran oportunidad intentamos que compense su agresividad es tan impetuoso tan agresivo que a veces hay que frenarle
5948632 mira c mo combaten los rivales cu ntas veces tiran por asalto con qu t cnicas pierna y puntuaci n con qu aciertos y fallos hacemos lo mismo que en el baloncesto pero adaptado
5948633 y creo que el hecho de que est aqu demuestra que algunas cosas est n cambiando en los pa ses rabes
5948634 no me fijo en c mo visten las dem s tan solo pienso en la meta

5948636 esta prueba tiene pocas posibilidades de mejora ya que poco se puede ganar en velocidad y tampoco mucho en t cnica
5948637 estaba harto de relojes y otros objetos que luego ten a que vender porque lo que necesitaba era dinero
5948638 s lo he tratado de divertirme un poco mientras me clasificaba
5948639 no hay que tomarse todo tan en serio hay que divertirse de vez en cuando y tampoco exagerar a diciendo que fue un footing simplemente dir a que era la mejor forma de pasar a la final
5948640 pero a n noto que me queda una carrera y lo voy a dar todo
5948641 ich bin ein pers nliches beispiel daf r wie man zwei unternehmen zusammenf hren und aus ihren st rken nutzen ziehen kann

5948644 ha sido un mal trago no ha habido feeling con el disco ponedlo as que queda bonito siempre que salgo as con la mochila a mitad de una final y es la tercera vez consecutiva se piensa en una oportunidad perdida pero soy un luchador un currante s que soy un gran disc bolo se me resisten las medallas qu le voy a hacer
5948645 es la primera vez que saco los mejores lanzamientos en la ltima oportunidad
5948646 ahora s lo me falta saber controlar la ansiedad en la competici n
5948647 me enter de que ten a que venir a pek n a competir en madison hace 25 d as pero ya hab a sido campe n de espa a junto a miquel alzamora que a su vez hab a sido compa ero de joan
5948648 todo el m rito es de joan yo simplemente ejecut la t ctica que l ide haciendo los relevos que me marcaba
5948649 estaba fundido pero mir al marcador vi que bamos terceros y hab a que intentar que nadie nos ganara esa vuelta
5948650 no me esperaba que nos consideraran favoritos pero los rivales nos ten an fichados
5948651 cuando arrancamos se hizo muy dura la carrera hab a que tapar muchos huecos despu s de ganar una vuelta y tiramos muchos cartuchos
5948652 es lo m ximo el espa ol m s laureado en unos juegos me parece poco considerarle un crack
5948653 para que sea un buen ballet las chicas deben expresar algo con sentido art stico
5948654 hoy d a hay muchos equipos que tapan una esquina de su porter a con un kamikaze que sale a cortar la l nea del tiro no puedo entender que los rbitros cuando el kamikaze recibe un bolazo piten falta en contra del lanzador eso nos pit contra corea y el nuestro no fue un tiro peligroso por encima de la cintura fue normal le peg en la espinillera
5948655 aqu hay un 6 de china que lleva por lo menos seis bolazos
5948656 aqu aqu aqu se se ala el pecho el muslo el brazo el est mago y sigue meti ndose por la gloria del pa s si le matan pondr n a otro miradlo es el que sale en l nea directa hacia el tirador a buscar la bola los surcoreanos lo han hecho le hemos dado y el rbitro ha pitado en contra interpreta peligro para m no somos nosotros los que hemos creado el peligro es el kamikaze el que deliberadamente se ha puesto en esa situaci n los rbitros con estas decisiones le quitan fuerza al penalti c rner
5948657 cuando est s en una esquina no puedes tirar a gol entonces lo primordial si no puedes pasar es buscar los pies del contrario con una bola levantada con un poco de picard a se provocan bastantes penaltis
5948658 seguro que alg n d a volver a unos juegos
5948659 ten an tanta qu mica que les val a un gesto para entenderse
5948660 pero con quien de verdad ten a qu mica era con g lvez era como un hermano cuando discut an era pensando en c mo har an para reconciliarse
5948661 les val a un gesto para entenderse adem s t cticamente g lvez que era sprinter le abr a m s posibilidades no necesitaban imperiosamente coger vueltas para puntuar
5948662 joan ha perdido velocidad pero ha ganado fuerza y para compensar ese problema tiene su truco que es el de usar un desarrollo m s grande que el de sus rivales as les sorprende con sus zarpazos
5948663 luego es muy fr o en la carrera sabe que todo lo que se gaste de m s al principio se echar de menos al final as calcula qu sprints le pueden ir bien y aunque est tan vigilado c mo ganar vuelta eso los primeros 25 kil metros despu s se calienta pero sigue siendo muy t cnico y astuto es una calculadora a 180 pulsaciones por minuto a 50 kil metros por hora lo que demuestra que f sicamente est muy bien la cabeza s lo funciona bien si el cuerpo est bien
5948664 llevaba en la cabeza todos los datos todos los puntos de las parejas rivales lo ten a claro pero finalmente vieron el v deo y la federaci n pas de reclamar

5948672 vivimos una etapa muy buena con luis y nos sentimos muy unidos a l intentaremos lo mismo con del bosque
5948673 pero que te gane un blanco nunca te gusta la verdad es que me gustar a intercambiar su tercero por mi quinto
5948674 un quinto puesto est muy bien pero que te gane un blanco nunca te gusta
5948675 pero no no he pecado de falta de ambici n
5948676 he venido a por una medalla no a ver qu pasaba pero quiz me he equivocado tuve miedo pero deb a haberme asomado por la cabeza en el 1 000 sin embargo pens que me desgastar a demasiado confiaba en mi ltimo 300 pero a la hora de la verdad cuando lleg el momento todos empezaron a moverse y me encontr sin hueco pens que hallar a calle libre y no fue as s lo en la ltima recta vi por d nde colarme

5948681 die deutsche post die zufriedenstellende operative ergebnisse ausweist steht nicht unter druck die postbank zu verkaufen
5948682 das problem ist dass es wegen der finanzkrise derzeit sehr wenige gibt die sich die postbank leisten k nnen
5948683 zudem d rfte der k ufer es schwer haben vor seinen aktion ren zu rechtfertigen warum man ein unternehmen bernimmt dass eine h here bewertung als man selbst hat

5948692 its actually a good thing where a guys ticked off at the other guy
5948693 i think weve all been in that position where we played with a guy where at times youre not playing well and sometimes that gets on your nerves or it affects your psyche i have no problem playing against people like that because you know youve just got to get under that guys skin and maybe he doesnt play as well
5948694 this is probably my first volleyball match that ive ever been nervous before the actual match
5948695 passing setting hitting shooting blocking digging obviously theres room for improvement still we werent perfect but i thought we played pretty well considering all things
5948696 renato struggled with dalhaussers block and that made him change his game strategy and make a lot of mistakes im still kind of lost it was a bad performance we didnt expect to play so badly but the next match cant be worse than this
5948697 tot een paar weken geleken duidelijk werd dat er een bordeel voor gehandicapten komt dat gelooft toch geen mens dat die dure yab yum zich inhoudt met gehandicapten het is gewoon een truc om sneller aan een bouwvergunning te geraken

5948925 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5948926 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5948927 mais que voulez vous on sait quil est mort apr s pour le reste y a rien de plus savoir
5948928 il tait fier de partir l bas fier de prendre part sa premi re op ration l tranger quand il est parti mais il avait seulement 1 an dexp rience 6 mois de formation et 6 mois dexercices en caserne ce nest pas assez c tait les envoyer au casse pipe
5948929 mais il faut tre r aliste c tait son m tier il lavait choisi il voulait tre soldat depuis quil avait 12 ans et il avait vraiment trouv quelque chose dans lequel il tait heureux lui qui n tais pas du tout scolaire il avait la pugnacit et la rage il a fini 2 me de ses classes quelques poussi res du 1er
5948930 je nen veux personne mais je minterroge au nom de quoi toutes les guerres nont pas rien chang la face du monde et pourquoi envoyer de jeunes soldats inexp riment s dans un pays o les gens se battent depuis toujours et nont connu que cela alexis nest pas le premier ni le dernier il y en aura dautres au nom dint r ts qui nous chappent
5948931 les envoyer en afghanistan avec 1 an dexp rience c tait les envoyer au casse pipe
5948932 la drh imagine que le militant politique va mettre le feu lusine
5948933 la drh imagine que le militant politique va mettre le feu lusine
5948934 this has taken over the new role as my favorite thrift in the city
5948935 maybe we should learn to wear the turbans and learn how to ride camels from now remember hadi is the pm in waiting
5948936 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5948937 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5948938 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5948939 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5948940 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5948941 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5948942 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5948943 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5948944 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5948945 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5948946 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5948947 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5948948 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5948949 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5948950 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5948951 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5948952 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5948953 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5948954 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5948955 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5948956 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5948957 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5948958 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5948959 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5948960 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5948961 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5948962 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5948963 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5948964 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5948965 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5948966 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5948967 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5948968 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5948969 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5948970 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5948971 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5948972 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5948973 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5948974 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5948975 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5948976 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5948977 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5948978 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5948979 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5948980 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5948981 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5948982 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5948983 so necessary to the church is a lofty concept of god that when that concept in any measure declines the church with her worship and her moral standards declines along with it the first step down for any church is taken when it surrenders its high opinion of god
5948984 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5948985 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5948986 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5948987 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5948988 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5948989 agencies that arent paying competitive wage increases are losing staff to agencies which are near the top of the pay pile
5948990 that has a compound effect on the cost for the losing agency
5948991 so if youre on the bottom of the pay pile because you dont have funding sufficient to meet wage increases and youre churning staff your resources are continually being dragged into paying your advertising and recruitment costs
5948992 it just puts you further and further behind the eight ball
5948993 i guarantee that if you put a group of centrelink workers into an office perhaps here in canberra for a day or two they could come up with pages and pages of ways that greater efficiencies could be made which didnt have the deleterious effects that we believe the current funding arrangements have
5948994 il existe un cart avec la nouvelle g n ration mais il faut quelquun pour montrer le chemin et comme je me sens toujours un peu jeune je pense que je la comprends bien
5948995 la drh imagine que le militant politique va mettre le feu lusine
5948996 theres really very little doubt that theyve been successful at that
5948997 commitment to carry on the fight against the criminal hordes until their elimination
5948998 we support the government of algeria as best we can in trying to fight this
5948999 this hotel has the most comfortable bed ive ever slept on
5949000 just as we cannot say this list is sufficient we cannot say for sure that all the ingredients are necessary but we suspect that over 10 or 20 years of fast growth all of these ingredients will matter
5949001 the nerve of her expressing feelings and writing emotions and such she should be ashamed does she not know she is a guide there is no room for objections only agree agree agree
5949002 why the boink would you care if someone changed their profile background to an image of their name or a picture of their favorite band or a picture of their actual face
5949003 have you forgotten that behind these lcd screens lies an actual human being
5949004 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
5949005 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
5949006 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
5949007 having successfully implemented organizational changes to reduce operating expenses strengthened questairs balance sheet through the most recent equity offering and entered into a new multi year engineering service contract with exxonmobil research amp engineering the board and jonathan agreed that this would be an appropriate time to transition the leadership of the company
5949008 the company is now in the position to build on these successes and transition to a commercially sustainable enterprise
5949009 andrew brings a fresh perspective and new energy to the role of ceo at questair and the board is confident that he can drive the company to profitability
5949010 andrews understanding of the companys key markets customers and partners will enable him to hit the ground running and develop the strategies necessary to achieve commercial growth in the refinery and biogas markets
5949011 i am privileged and excited by the opportunity to lead questair the growth drivers in the biogas and refinery markets remain very strong and we have an excellent and committed team to execute in these markets the core components of our strategy remain in place with an added emphasis on increasing our sales and customer focus building and improving our execution capability and developing new growth opportunities
5949012 i am very pleased that andrew hall with whom i have worked on the development of questair for some years will succeed me in leading the company into its next phase of growth
5949013 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5949014 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5949015 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5949016 i am curious as to the mechanism by which they spontaneously combust

5949022 this is again a major win for vizrts mam business in germany a very important market for us as can be seen from the large deal with the german football league we announced previously we now have five installations operational and in progress to be delivered in germany
5949023 not to sound cocky but everythings kind of coming naturally
5949024 everyone has got that dream in their head im just ready for tomorrow
5949025 i dont know what happened we looked at the videos and its just one of those things
5949026 the top time was recorded by anne caroline chausson of france in the first run
5949027 since mr vestrum assumed the chief executive officer position in 2002 crew has been transformed from a small junior exploration company with no production to an emerging mid tier gold producer with approximately 70 000 ounces of production last quarter crew now has a strong technical and operating team focused on continuing to significantly improve the production profile of the companys principal operating asset at the lefa gold mine in guinea west africa as well as sourcing and evaluating other opportunities in that region on behalf of the board of directors i wish to thank mr vestrum for his contributions and wish him well in his future endeavours
5949028 in the name of god the merciful the compassionate o god we beseech you to hasten the lofty advent of your heir the hidden shiite imam o god present him with good health and your assistance and grant us the honor of being his best companions and to testify before him

5949030 were probably gonna work on something to pick up fridays

5949063 i know wei i miss her too anyway im glad that you find her a praise worthy choice
5949064 well master hitomi she does strike me as a lady of refinement unlike someone we know

5949066 see what i mean only a real lady would choose tea over coffee

5949074 yes but they were returned to me the addressee moved house during our correspondence and she didnt tell me where she moved all the letters have return to sender stamped on them

5949076 you can count on me mistress rika good day to you and the young master

5949079 yes but they were returned to me the addressee moved house during our correspondence and she didnt tell me where she moved all the letters have return to sender stamped on them
5949080 i dont even remember i was very young when i wrote those letters and i havent seen these letters in years if you find them please send them over

5949084 he lost confidence after losing those first few points to lin dan
5949085 you take a look around and see what it all is and get a little perspective
5949086 in early action u s olympic trials champion mike day had the fastest time in the mens seeding time trial and easily won all three of his qualifying races suggesting hes in gold medal form kintner the lone american woman moved into thursdays semifinals seeded seventh in her field of 16
5949087 not to sound cocky but everythings kind of coming naturally
5949088 for the better part of a week it had been mostly fun and games for the u s bmx crew three time world champion kyle bennett broke the pedal off a rickshaw he borrowed while filming a spot for the u s television network nbc in downtown beijing
5949089 but at the same time this is a once in a lifetime thing and i find that the more experiences you take in the better you are as a person you cant miss the games we saw the 100 meters how unreal is that fastest man alive
5949090 the board and i are delighted at the appointment of blue oar as joint broker to the company and we look forward to working with them
5949091 the ioc was very clear in the leadup we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
5949092 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business
5949093 davies said she didnt know whether all tests had come back clean from the mens 100 meter final on saturday in which jamaicas usain bolt won the gold medal in a world record time of 9
5949094 ser un estadio totalmente nuevo tir ndose hasta la ltima piedra del actual
5949095 media reports have suggested mr green could step aside as early as this week
5949096 the company is aware of ongoing media speculation relating to management and board changes
5949097 while no decision has been made a subcommittee of the companys board is meeting on the morning of thursday 21 august 2008 when necessary information is available to them to consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
5949098 the strong result was achieved despite the significant fall in commodity prices and a rising australian dollar during the year highlighting the value of its diversified low cost production base
5949099 kagara has performed exceptionally well despite a generally tough operating environment
5949100 this excellent financial performance highlights the strong margins which our north queensland operations are capable of generating even in a lower commodity price environment
5949101 kagara has performed exceptionally well despite a generally tough operating environment
5949102 this excellent financial performance highlights the strong margins which our north queensland operations are capable of generating even in a lower commodity price environment
5949103 the diversified nature of our production base is also an important factor with copper now the main driver of our earnings growth and providing an excellent buffer against the current cyclical downswing in zinc prices
5949104 with the medium term outlook for copper remaining positive and our production forecast to increase strongly again this financial year the outlook for kagara remains very positive
5949105 importantly the strong cash generation of our core base metal operations also provides the necessary financial capacity to support our growth objectives
5949106 the estimated 50 million capital expenditure requirement remaining to bring the mungana operations on stream in early 2009 is in part being internally funded and in light of this the board has decided not to pay a dividend for the 2007 08 financial year
5949107 while this is regrettable the companys ability to internally fund this key development project represents an important strategic advantage in the current equity market environment with the mungana development set to increase our copper production and enable us to more than double our zinc production to in excess of 100 000tpa of metal in concentrate in the 2009 10 financial year
5949108 this will also enable us to internally fund the other exciting growth projects within our portfolio including the lounge lizard nickel project the admiral bay nickel project for which a maiden resource estimate is imminent and the large scale red dome gold project in queensland
5949109 i like salman sanjay saif akshay way better than these two
5949110 its not about aamir its about the movie my friend
5949111 i like salman sanjay saif akshay way better than these two
5949112 its not about aamir its about the movie my friend
5949113 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5949114 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5949115 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5949116 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5949117 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5949118 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5949119 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5949120 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5949121 we are delighted and honoured to host the uss john s mccain and her crew during their visit to australia just as our forefathers did 100 years ago this visit serves to further strengthen the close ties our nations enjoy
5949122 there is no doubt that the fleets visit renewed emphasis on the establishment of the australian navy
5949123 the arrival of the fleet 100 years ago was a significant event in itself for the us navy this time it is two navies coming in together in particular the hmas darwin which is a us designed frigate it shows the strength of our relationship
5949124 we only have 300 with us i hope to leave with the number i came with
5949125 these figures show train tram and bus services are more popular than ever and since becoming premier i have made it clear that public transport continues to be a key priority for the government
5949126 the eastern and southeast suburban train lines are a disaster cranbourne pakenham and frankston for late running and lilydale sandringham frankston and glen waverley for cancelled trains
5949127 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5949128 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5949129 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5949130 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5949131 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5949132 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5949133 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5949134 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5949135 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5949156 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5949157 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5949158 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5949159 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5949160 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5949161 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems

5949179 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
5949180 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports
5949181 i will be meeting peter later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
5949182 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
5949183 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
5949184 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
5949185 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this

5949187 i asked the metro police officer if i could pick it up at the police station the next day or so but she said it would be kept at the premises of the towing firm

5949189 something was not right with my car so i decided to stop and have a look
5949190 i also wanted to make some phone calls requesting help since the area where i had the breakdown is not safe
5949191 when he was in front of me he turned and drew a firearm pointed it at me and demanded money and my cellphone
5949192 i was shocked and pleaded with him not to hurt me fortunately i did not have cash with me so i told him that we would have to find a nearby garage with an atm so that i could withdraw money for him
5949193 at the parking lot of the garage i realised that there were too many people around and that this guy might hurt people because he had two guns one in his hand and another at his waist
5949194 i suggested that we find another garage and he was very upset saying i was playing games and that he urgently needed money after a while i convinced him that we should go to another atm at a nearby sasol garage
5949195 he parked the car and threatened to shoot me i had to beg him not to pull the trigger i told him he would get the money and he should also take the car my last option was an atm at the pavilion i had difficulty in convincing him to go there but he agreed
5949196 when one switches it on it has the sabc logo as the screen saver i plead with anyone who may have bought it from this guy to please hand it in to their nearest police station because it has a lot of information research and other important work documents

5949234 not being in a band anymore and being in a situation where im solo and not having a lot of people bugging me feeling i owe them i can pick and choose the people i work with
5949235 its made me want to write and play music again
5949236 there were a lot of lean years where there wasnt much money to make records but it does force you to hustle harder to look for new ways to do things and it invigorates me
5949237 ive thrived as the underdog when you feel a bit beleaguered thats good for making rock music
5949238 in my twenties i was pretty much in a constant stage of angst mostly unjustified
5949239 now i can see i was very fortunate i was not trained in music and somehow ive been successful at it i feel lucky that people are still interested in what i do

5949246 i will not judge my fellow malaysians by the colour of their skin or their religious affiliation but by the strength of their character and the courage of their conviction

5949252 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team
5949253 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5949254 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5949255 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5949256 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today

5949292 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5949293 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5949294 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5949295 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5949296 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5949297 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5949298 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5949299 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5949300 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5949301 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5949302 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5949303 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5949304 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5949305 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5949306 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

5949308 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

5949314 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5949315 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5949316 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

5949323 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5949324 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5949325 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5949326 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

5949328 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

5949340 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5949341 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5949342 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5949343 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5949344 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5949345 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5949346 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5949347 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5949348 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5949349 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5949350 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5949351 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5949352 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5949353 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5949354 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5949355 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5949356 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5949357 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5949358 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5949359 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5949360 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5949361 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5949362 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5949363 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5949364 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5949365 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5949366 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5949367 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5949368 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5949369 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5949370 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5949371 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5949372 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

5949374 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5949375 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5949376 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5949377 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5949378 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5949379 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5949380 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5949381 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5949382 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5949383 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5949384 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5949387 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5949395 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5949396 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5949397 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5949398 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5949399 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5949400 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5949401 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5949402 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5949403 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5949404 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5949405 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5949406 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5949407 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5949408 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5949409 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5949410 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5949411 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5949412 coach has been telling the team that we are the only team in the league that can really go on a five or six game winning streak
5949413 maybe its that time right now that we can get on it
5949414 we dont know what their team is going to be we kind of guessed
5949415 i think they have maybe three players who have played consistently this season because of the injuries
5949416 we always tell the guys you have to play them as if theyre going to have their best game
5949417 one thing i can say about chivas the thing i give them a ton of respect and a ton of compliments on is they work hard
5949418 preki does a good job of getting his players to play hard for each other
5949419 its time for us who have not been starting to go in there and do what the other players have been doing keeping the team on the streak its on

5949450 the usoc explained that athletes are free to choose their religious preferences and it cannot be a condition of participation on any team or camp
5949451 some athletes do have an athlete generated daily bible session at the otc but participation is voluntary as far as the usoc knows and the coach does not attend
5949452 they have a responsibility to be inclusive and to embrace diversity and we often think of diversity as a racial or gender thing

5949530 the post mortem report says that nayak died of strangulation no other wounds were found on his body investigations are on to confirm the cause of his death
5949531 we found nayak hanging from a teakwood tree he had hanged himself with a nylon rope and his socks and shoes were on the ground
5949532 nayak came to pune two and a half months ago he was living with a friend at chandan nagar he kept to himself

5949534 the decision is not taken in a instant but a man makes up his mind over a period of time as his frustration level rises he starts feeling that nobody is going to help him and the best way out is to end his life such people always give out verbal and non verbal signals indicating their plight if at that time they are given support and counseling even by a friend such incidences may be averted

5949546 at the point of completion we will look at the business case for the hourly service again
5949547 i think the more frequent the service the more attractive it is to the travelling public
5949548 it is something the liaison committee is in support of and we will be reflecting the support that has been given to improving the service by the constituent parts of the committee
5949549 our research shows there is a clear need for a more frequent service on this line as at the moment it isnt meeting passenger demands

5949570 weve had positive dialogue with regulators about our current action plans and they accept that we are making good progress
5949571 the action plans which were being prepared at the time of the inspection reflect our own risk assessments and also respond to issues identified by the ombudsman
5949572 we keep these under review despite the system change the vast majority of claimants received correct payments throughout the period
5949573 this shows that the benefits section is clearly not a dysfunctional service as claimed by the ombudsman it has had problems but were certainly on the right path towards resolving them

5949600 i did once say that to me art and the saints are the greatest apologetic for our faith
5949601 the arguments contributed by reason are unquestionably important and indispensable but then there is always dissent somewhere
5949602 on the other hand if we look at the saints this great luminous trail on which god passed through history we see that there truly is a force of good that resists the millennia likewise if we contemplate the beauties created by faith they are simply i would say the living proof of faith
5949603 it speaks to us itself and on the basis of the cathedrals beauty we succeed in visibly proclaiming god christ and all his mysteries here they have acquired a form and look at us
5949604 are all a luminous sign of god and therefore truly a manifestation an epiphany of god
5949605 i think the great music born in the church makes the truth of our faith audible and perceivable
5949606 in listening to all these works we suddenly understand it is true wherever such things are born the truth is there without an intuition that discovers the true creative center of the world such beauty cannot be born

5949714 en la pen nsula de yucat n se producen 20 variedades de miel todas de excelente calidad por ejemplo en enero se la dzindzantun en febrero la multiflora en abril la tejonal en octubre la kandzunuc entre otras
5949715 toda esta variedad se propicia por la existencia y el cultivo de abejas y la gran variedad de vegetaci n tropical y a los bajo del suelo de la pen nsula lo que da una coyontura para la buena producci n del n ctar
5949716 en cuanto al color que tenga el sabor es nico es muy dulce y fuerte tanto que si se ingieren varias cucharadas a la vez es posible que se sienta un ligero cosquilleo en la lengua sin embargo esto de los sabores es muy relativo pues existen sabores de miel pura a lim n naranja menta chocolate y muchos otros y esto es posible colocando frascos de jarabes artificiales de sabores vegetales a la entrada de las colmenas de ah toman el jarabe las abejas y lo mezclan con el n ctar que recolectan

5949746 bienvenidos metimos las maletas dentro de la casa est bamos en nuestra casa
5949747 en casas que al l h ha permitido que se levanten y se recuerde en ellas su nombre y en las que le glorifican ma ana y tarde hombres a los que ni el negocio ni el comercio les distraen del recuerdo de al l h de establecer el salat y de entregar el zakat temen un d a en el que los corazones y la vista sean puestos del rev s
5949748 y es verdad que hemos hecho que descendieran para vosotros signos clarificadores y ejemplos de quienes hubo antes que vosotros as como una exhortaci n para los tienen af n de regresar a al l h
5949749 al l h es la luz de los cielos y de la tierra su luz es como una hornacina en la que hay una l mpara la l mpara est dentro de un vidrio y el vidrio es como un astro radiante se enciende gracias a un rbol bendito un olivo que no es ni oriental ni occidental cuyo aceite casi alumbra sin que lo toque el fuego luz sobre luz al l h gu a hacia su luz a quien quiere al l h llama la atenci n de los hombres con ejemplos y al l h conoce todas las cosas

5949752 one world two wheels is not a flavor of the month
5949753 the key point is we are making a big difference
5949754 weve had to turn away 50 percent of contracts city and county recreation planners want parks
5949755 we liked the family aspect and we liked how they owned their own production everyone who is there is an employee of the company we met all the seamstresses and saw all the factories where they were sewing clothing
5949756 we liked the whole feeling of the company it is a hard working blue collar racing oriented company we fell in love with that boutique mentality because we share the same thing at ochsner
5949757 were looking to grow with some existing etxeondo customers and in high end specialty bike stores
5949758 the cause is just it is an honor for france and its armies to defend them
5949759 reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
5949760 we made the written report the fiscal realignment was not necessary and the transfer of funds was not necessary either so we complied the governors in full compliance i feel
5949761 the issues that will be addressed at this meeting ultimately affect our community
5949762 right now people are actually going to the extent of chopping the hose which you would fill your gas at the gas station where the gas runs in
5949763 yes ann i bought a purple rabbit fur coat on ebay with your account so what ann omg ann you are so f ing dumb you dont know anything ann where the hell is my coat ann i dont care ann im going to leave bad feedback ann so what ann shes the idiot where the hellllllllll is it ann
5949764 well its not like you have that much hair just do it
5949765 scott has an excellent track record with his other store in santa maria mainstreet cycles
5949766 hes very enthusiastic about opening a second store and hes committed to growing the giant brand along with his brand we feel theres no better person to partner with as we develop this exciting new direction for giant
5949767 when the idea for cycle star began to emerge we already knew our competitor was going away
5949768 this was going to leave two major brands literally up for grabs one being giant bicycle i held meetings with both companies at interbike that year and the staff at giant was more interested and willing to listen to our plans giants history in town combined with a wonderful corporate staff made the decision easy
5949769 from my travels and racing throughout california i have made a point of visiting many shops and concept stores of all types along the way
5949770 some were great others left me cold their store could have been anywhere usa what i have found that makes the difference with giants gbs store idea is that giant places a very high concern for the dealer first and the giant brand second
5949771 giant has made this a collaborative effort in that they have given me flexibility to keep and celebrate our local dealer identity while elevating the giant brand the result will be that we have a national caliber store with a local dealer feel that is unique to us and our market
5949772 well im just not going to vote because i dont want any of the candidates to win
5949773 oh ya totally me neither thats so gross omg like no way thats stupid
5949774 large gatherings are arlingtons greatest risk we are a large tourist center we see that increasing for years to come

5949776 i wouldnt be surprised if you show up here next year with a 70 million positive bottom line
5949777 id love a half cent tax rate reduction or even more a penny but i dont want us to cripple ourselves in the deal
5949778 fort worth has always been a leader in urban development and perhaps has one of the best downtowns in all of america
5949779 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane
5949780 a score that is months old would not reflect the condition of the restaurant today that is why we focus on the most recent scores
5949781 we had no critical items as far as temperature issues or anything like that
5949782 the critical issues we did have were all corrected as the inspector went through we always try to turn those around within 24 hours or less
5949783 it really makes you feel like you are doing things right
5949784 i f i were the ukrainians id infiltrate some folks into russia with instructions to blow up some pipelines etc if that happened it would be cheap and effective
5949785 the 21st century will be known as the age of the entrepreneur it will be a time when americans and others from many of the worlds capitalist economies will return to their roots of individual family owned businesses and with this return will come not just enormous personal wealth for those who get there first but also the resulting moral and family values as well as freedom that come with owning your own business and controlling your own destiny
5949786 the key to becoming wealthy is the ability to convert earned income into passive income and or portfolio income as quickly as possible
5949787 what type of medical insurance do you carry for this child
5949788 its a systematic way of identifying every uninsured child and linking them with coverage
5949789 it was like a choice between health insurance and rent and groceries and we had to keep the rent

5949839 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5949840 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5949841 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5949842 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
5949843 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
5949844 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 mu m which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult beta globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
5949845 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
5949846 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5949847 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5949848 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5949849 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5949850 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
5949851 management of severe pain with strong opioids is unfortunately associated with a number of side effects the most prevalent side effect is development of constipation constipation may lead to discomfort and ineffective analgesia
5949852 the new generation of prokinetic drugs with peripheral opioid antagonistic actions seems to offer our patients a more effective solution to opioid induced bowel problems than conventional laxative therapies
5949853 healthcare payers and providers are grappling with the best techniques for treating adhd as knowledge of this disruptive and sometimes debilitating disease spreads unfortunately in most cases current evidence is limited and further studies are needed before these drugs can be unequivocally recommended for use
5949854 unfortunately for sufferers of adhd and their families there are few clear conclusions that can be drawn from the research to date on the best treatment options in the case of stimulant treatment for children clinical studies do demonstrate short term relief but many families have concerns about administering stimulants to children in these cases atomoxetine represents a good option with clinical evidence demonstrating some effectiveness
5949855 ihv has created a collaborative environment where multidisciplinary research education and clinical programs work to accelerate the development of pioneering therapies for hiv aids we are honored to have been accepted to discuss our data with ihvs respected team and members of the research and medical communities
5949856 our work is unraveling a link between inflammatory events that characterize early stages of infection the importance of inflammation on susceptibility to hiv and a link to an individuals mhc molecules
5949857 our findings suggest that with the proper predictions we can synthesize targeted peptides to treat people with different types of mhc alleles providing potentially an inexpensive biologically active therapy for hiv
5949858 while the results in human clinical trials are promising the challenge has been identifying the mechanism and the active component of the mixtures
5949859 it appears to be precisely when the non specific cells dont die on cue that chronic pathologies begin
5949860 peripheral cd4 loss of regulatory t cells is associated with persistent viremia in chronic hiv infection
5949861 depletion of regulatory t cells is associated with immune activation
5949862 we are very excited after many years of research to finally have discovered what appears to be the promising mechanism of action that could optimize our treatment to its fullest potential this also opens the door to a paradigm shift in thinking around hiv aids therapies

5949867 a 12 year old girl at the highest levels of exposure to sexual content on tv behaved like a 14 or 15 year old at the lowest levels of tv viewing
5949868 this is the strongest evidence yet that the sexual content of television programs encourages adolescents to initiate sexual intercourse and other sexual activities

5949879 centrals the 11th ranked team in the nation coming into this so i think you have to pick them as a favorite
5949880 western oregon had a real good season last year and they have a good team coming back so i can see that
5949881 were coming out of the north central conference along with central and the rest are coming in after playing as independents
5949882 it should be interesting to see how that plays out
5949883 with the old astroturf we would change practice around because there were things we didnt want to do on that field
5949884 we tried to do our hitting stuff at civic stadium because we didnt want to see the players bodies hitting that surface
5949885 for the most part weve been able to avoid the injuries
5949886 we have some guys dealing with some muscle stuff like hamstring pulls and a couple of guys have had headaches which because of concussions were real cautious of but its been pretty good i think everyone is feeling a lot better on this turf
5949887 i had a long talk with him and right now he said its just not what he wants to do
5949888 he looks like someone that belongs on this field right now if he keeps coming like he is hes somebody that could play right away
5949889 we have a lot of new players out here learning a lot of things
5949890 today was one of those days where the players have to push themselves through but the attitude has been good the effort has been good and i think were more athletic on the field than we have been in the past
5949891 if she freaks out and cries for more than thirty minutes call me but she should be okay soon

5949895 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy

5949917 i did not interrupt god he was not speaking but you can not start the meeting and then make our only choice to leave or listen to a prayer to your god

5949939 the georgian military attack on south ossetia was very impetuous the matter should be investigated
5949940 we are concerned about the fact that some politicians emerge in russia and the united states who would like to return the way of the world back to the cold war era
5949941 to simplify it we are aware of that it is impossible that a foreign state enters the territory of another state if not invited and by military force we have put it clearly that the troops without an international peacekeeping mandate must immediately leave the georgian territory
5949942 we are negotiating with the doko n publishing house to publish the book in russia they would like to see the biggest possible print run for us it is not primarily a profit oriented project
5949943 we have taken interest in the book because it is concerned with the energy industry and that is our field of activity
5949944 i appreciate lukoils help especially the help of its president vagit alekperov who was the main initiator of the project
