4890002 the cost of shipping a 40 foot container from shanghai to the united states has risen to 8 000 compared with 3 000 early in the decade according to a recent study of transportation costs big container ships the pack mules of the 21st century economy have shaved their top speed by nearly 20 percent to save on fuel costs substantially slowing shipping times
4890003 shipping costs is on average the equivalent of a 9 percent tariff on trade
4890004 the industries most likely to be affected by the sharp rise in transportation costs are those producing
4890005 a first and elementary level of learning and knowledge development process is what argyris and schon have called single loop learning such learning does not require change of the basic model that is being applied only an adjustment of the values of existing parameters it leads to increased efficiency within a frame work
4890006 for the first level of outcome basically incremental improvement within an essentially stable framework the type of political leadership that best seems to reflect the situation is what weber would have called rational leadership it is based on an intellectual understanding of the productive processes of the organization and supports the efficiency and continuous adaptive improvement of those processes
4890007 the immune system may become too strong for a company to break out of the frames reorientation of a company changing its business idea or business model requires a realignment of both the cognitive processes and the power system
4890008 to achieve frame breaking reconfiguration a company needs to engage in what argyris and schon have called double loop learning the outcome is what i refer to as reorientation as opposed to variation in this case we are talking about more than adjustment within a given mind frame thomas khun would have called this a revolution a result of extraordinary problem solving as opposed to puzzle laying in the history of science this process corresponds to the great changes of world view from the world as earth centred to the world as sun centred from the world as a clock mechanism to the world as an organism etc
4890009 at our second level then we need political leadership that can break up old structures the role of the leader in such a situation is to extract create or co create and then articulate a vision and direction which breaks the frame and creates a new one and in particular leadership at this level always means using power to redistribute power and change the power system
4890010 leaders who are able to do this must act either as entrepreneurs who stand for their own new vision themselves or as midwives able to put together fragments already existing within people in and outside the organization into a new coherent direction the need for such visionary leadership is very strong in todays structurally changing value creation landscape the challenges are essentially two one is to articulate and propagate the new direction the other is to manage the transition the latter part is particularly devious and difficult today since re orientations now often tend to imply not just moving from a mature area with a slowly declining future into some other area with higher prospects of growth but to actually replace an existing business model with another in the process literally killing or destroying many of the elements of an organization while retaining a certain hub of the reframing the new is built on the ruins of the old
4890011 the other way to persuade people and ultimately a much more powerful way is by uniting an idea with an emotion the best way to do that is by telling a compelling story
4890012 whats wrong with painting a positive picture it doesnt ring true
4890013 positive hypothetical pictures and boilerplate press releases actually work against you because they foment distrust among the people youre trying to convince
4890014 the energy to live comes from the dark side it comes from everything that makes us suffer
4890015 so a story that embraces darkness produces a positive energy in listeners absolutely we follow people in whom we believe the best leaders ive dealt with have come to terms with dark reality

4890032 only express sexual interest in those women who you are confident are interested in you prior to that always be polite
4890033 in choosing a man look for politeness and respectful non sexual behavior
4890034 one of the main effective strategies for attracting women is learning to project entitlement to convey that you expect a woman to wish to have sex with you
4890035 nice guys are actually just selfish manipulative pricks trying to trade favors gifts and counselling services for sex then getting upset when the woman doesnt see fit to make such an exchange
4890036 only express sexual interest in those women who you are confident are interested in you prior to that always be polite
4890037 alas that seems to convey that the description nice guy always has a hidden or implied
4890038 only express sexual interest in those women who you are confident are interested in you prior to that always be polite
4890039 the truth is that there are no steps x y z that will make any woman fall in love with you or at least put out women are not interchangeable each one has a different set of memories biases subconscious images that cause her to be attracted to one person and not another and the idea that there should be an x y z that will cause any woman to be attracted to you unless theres something wrong with her of course is just plain insulting

4890047 why is persuasion so difficult and what can you do to set people on fire
4890048 there are two ways to persuade people the first is by using conventional rhetoric which is what most executives are trained in
4890049 but there are two problems with rhetoric first the people youre talking to have their own set of authorities statistics and experiences while youre trying to persuade them they are arguing with you in their heads second if you do succeed in persuading them youve done so only on an intellectual basis thats not good enough because people are not inspired to act by reason alone

4890052 the idea here is that increased entry and increased threat of entry enhance innovation and productivity growth not just because these are the direct result of quality improving innovations from new entrants but also because the threat of being driven out by a potential entrant gives incumbent firms an incentive to innovate in order to escape entry through an effect that works much like the escape competition effect described above note that it is important here that new entrants replace incumbent firms in other words that entry be associated with firm turnover

4890054 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4890055 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4890056 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4890057 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4890058 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4890059 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast england is different

4890077 its unthinkable to ask the government to force the church to abandon one of its sacraments to appease a radical anti religious agenda yet thats what this activist group did
4890078 according to italian law the demand to remove a name from the register must be made by an individual with a personal interest rather than by a private association such as the uaar
4890079 also it was easy to demonstrate that the group had no legal leg on which to stand
4890080 innovation is vital to corporate success in the global marketplace
4890081 we help businesses find keep and develop relationships with their clients so for example in financial services we often support companies as they try to find new customers and then will support them as they go to extend loans so we have a series of analytical solutions scoring models software systems and credit data to help for instance financial institutions better determine what kinds of rates they should give to consumers on loans
4890082 we have grown by acquisition in addition to our internal growth
4890083 we 16 different divisions or companies just in the u s because we would need to work through firewalls and other security issues bringing the software in house ourselves would have elongated the whole process so we were delighted that brightidea com had the capability that anybody could get to through the internet and we didnt have to work through some of the technology issues that might have been the case otherwise
4890084 they treated us as a partner meaning we have direct access to their team brightidea com ceo matt greeley has been personally involved in how we designed our innovation program and spoke with our leadership we really appreciated that personal attention
4890085 we really are trying to stimulate innovation in the business and have all our employees see themselves as contributing to the future growth of the business so now with this tool anybody at any location no matter where they are or what time of day it is can enter their ideas into the system that captures their thoughts

4890154 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4890155 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4890156 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4890157 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy

4890254 pada hari ini saya mohd saiful bukhari azlan dengan nama allah berikrar dan bersumpah diliwat datuk seri anwar ibrahim pada 26 jun 2008 jika saya berdusta atas pengakuan ini maka saya berdusta terhadap allah dan sanggup menerima azab laknat dan kutukan daripada allah hingga ke kiamat
4890255 kemudian sesiapa yang membantahmu wahai muhammad mengenainya sesudah engkau beroleh pengetahuan yang benar maka katakanlah kepada mereka
4890256 dan orang orang yang menuduh isterinya berzina sedang mereka tidak ada saksi saksi yang mengesahkan tuduhannya itu hanya dirinya sendiri maka persaksian sah pada syarak bagi seseorang yang menuduh itu hendaklah ia bersumpah dengan nama allah empat kali bahawa sesungguhnya ia dari orang orang yang benar
4890257 bahawa laknat allah akan menimpa dirinya jika ia dari orang orang yang dusta
4890258 bahawa kemurkaan allah akan menimpa dirinya jika suaminya dari orang orang yang benar
4890259 dan kalaulah tidak kerana adanya limpah kurnia allah dan rahmatnya kepada kamu dan juga kalaulah tidak kerana bahawa allah maha penerima taubat lagi maha bijaksana tentulah kamu akan akan mengalami kesusahan yang sukar diatasi
4890260 grande alegria de um homem inteligente se fazer de idiota diante de um idiota que se faz de inteligente
4890261 none of us really approve of bulwer lytton being used as an example of bad writing hes a great hero to us all over here
4890262 is a whimsical literary competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels
4890263 in keeping with the gravitas high seriousness and general bignitude of the contest the grand prize winner will receive a pittance
4890264 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4890265 if you want to scare me youre going to have to work a little harder than that
4890266 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius
4890267 i agree now that the words are cliched but if youre the first to pen them then surely thats a remarkable thing something to be proud of
4890268 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4890269 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention
4890270 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4890271 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4890272 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4890273 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard
4890274 imagine the world without diversity whitout the species we try to protect
4890275 open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4890276 in the ongoing battle with the mpaa and riaa there seems to be an ongoing argument about who is to blame
4890277 the best implementation of amazing geo flickr on iphone i just installed exposure on my iphone
4890278 which one possible fall 2008 apple product has the best chance of winning your dollars
4890279 i am convinced that further testing and autopsy results will show that this is not a hoax
4890280 a few of the coaches were speaking quite highly of us from what we have done in pre season and the changes to the team they will be showing us more respect this season
4890281 i dont think they will be too surprised if we could come up with some upsets this season
4890282 a natural target for everyone is to make the top four playoffs and with only eight teams in the league its not silly to set that target if we get a good start to the season and hopefully put a run together we can do it i think it is quite crucial we start well with two home games to look forward to
4890283 i never disregard anything like that but i am not really thinking about that too much i am focusing on this season
4890284 it hasnt really crossed my mind ive distanced myself from it and really focused on what i am doing here
4890285 ive been pretty busy i heard about it but i have not seen much about it i dont want it to distract me at the moment
4890286 something that i think if we were at a different part of the season in the standings and so forth he would pitch through it but at this point wed like to take the opportunity to just stretch him out a bit
4890287 hopefully get him ready to come back in september and be himself
4890288 now hold on there friend yes i did some ukrainian folk dancing as a child but theres no way im georgian
4890289 have they no care for sweet innocent children cursed with chinese peasant teeth as incidentally are most of the british
4890290 why this base act of trickery is the perfect metaphor for everything the chinese have been doing openly with nary an apology for as long as anyone can remember
4890291 the producers have decided to go for a different look
4890292 as a group snap has a survivors network those abused by priests we were at first concerned about the allegations against father gary mercure we were contacted by over a dozen men who were abused by this man and our concern was that the diocese did not move quickly enough
4890293 das war mit das wichtigste spiel meiner karriere vor dem f nften satz habe ich zu mir gesagt jetzt musst du zeigen ob du ein gewinner oder ein verlierer bist
4890294 ich w nsche keinem menschen dass er mit so einem druck umgehen und arbeiten muss und so ist es nach dem match auch aus mir herausgebrochen
4890295 die erste olympische medaille f r den deutschen tischtennisbund seit 1996 erringen konnte
4890296 vas need to lower their rates in order to stay competitive and continue signing up new clients
4890297 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4890298 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4890299 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4890300 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4890301 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4890302 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4890303 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4890304 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
4890305 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
4890306 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
4890307 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
4890308 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
4890309 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
4890310 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
4890311 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
4890312 considering we have only spent less than a week in pre season we saw many positives winning the game at the end is exciting it shows determination and a willingness to win this group can be special but we have a lot of work ahead of us and tomorrow we will be right back preparing for our game versus loyola we started strong tonight at times we chased a bit too much but our organization was good the team kept pushing hard in the second half and getting all the healthy players on the field was important we are talented and strength in numbers is definitely an advantage they are eager to learn and want to get better
4890313 we held our market share but frankly i am 62 years old and i am looking to retire in a few years and it was a natural progression with the market as it is today
4890314 as a small company it became hard to keep up with the demands of the internet market
4890315 real living has the computer capabilities the regional reach and the creativity to sell a home
4890316 weve sold homes to three and four generations of families in middletown
4890317 seventy years is a long time but its still a little bit emotional as we take the old signs down and put new signs up
4890318 dayton has a lot of assets between locations and film producers and crew
4890319 it just seemed this would be something important to develop
4890320 u oh another terrorist why dont they all go back to their own country
4890321 when most folks thing of a whole home dvr whdvr they may only see the obvious advantage of sharing a single program between two tvs in different parts of the house
4890322 if they want to make movies in dayton theyre going to have to compete
4890323 its a tough market out there because all these states are offering huge incentives financial incentives
4890324 think really out of the box and offer incentives no one can match
4890325 it is for a lot of people not in it a romantic business but it is a business its part of our economy
4890326 it really feels like an idea whose time has come here in dayton
4890327 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4890328 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4890329 we like the prospects in both markets and well continue to look for acquisitions that fit our strengths
4890330 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4890331 torres is a key player and he can change games
4890332 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4890333 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4890334 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4890335 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4890336 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4890337 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4890338 michael phelps will never have one one hundredth of the renown in the united states that ian thorpe has in australia
4890339 what a load of completly stupid silly uniformed highly biased horseshit
4890340 is an american able to integrate into the culture or like japan are the people superficially friendly but one is always a
4890341 i hear chaing mai is a wonderful place to live
4890342 it the impeachment is a political issue and not a legal one
4890343 now decisions will be made by parliament and not the courts parliament makes laws courts simply interpret them
4890344 does not indulge in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4890345 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4890346 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 per cent reduction in fertilization
4890347 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well under way may threaten the viability of many marine species
4890348 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
4890349 what we have now is evidence that the worlds marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not too distant future
4890350 allah melaknat lelaki yang menyerupai wanita dan wanita yang menyerupai lelaki
4890351 jika seorang wanita hendak mewarnai dua tangannya hendaklah ia mewarnai keseluruhan dua tangannya dengan pewarna tidak disunatkan baginya membuat lukisan ukiran begitu juga mewarnakan dengan hitam mewarnakan sebahagian jari sahaja dan memerahkan pipi malah diharamkan setiap satu dari perbuatan perbuatan tersebut ke atas wanita bujang yakni tidak bersuami dan juga wanita bersuami jika tidak diizinkan suaminya
4890352 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4890353 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4890354 the other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development
4890355 traditionally the pharmaceutical industry will admit that they actually charged what they think the market will bear the wiser ones are recognizing that that model is no longer available
4890356 of course pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine it costs on average 550 million 1 1 billion and takes more than 10 years to bring each new treatment to patients
4890357 naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price
4890358 we have a finite amount of money for health care and if you spend money one way you cant spend it in another
4890359 i have a little grandson who was the result of ivf the sadness of people who want to have children and cant is very real and so i wish it was more widely available
4890360 parliamentarians think theres a legislative way out of it and there isnt
4890361 there are criminal justice elements to the solution but its primarily a public health problem
4890362 i actually did i knew i wasnt as far behind as i was in prelims i saw crocker and figured they were at about the same speed when i did chop the last stoke i really thought that cost me the race but it happened to be the direct opposite if i would have glided i would have ended up being way too long i ended up making the right decision and i was trying to take a short fast stroke trying to get my hand on the wall first it turned out to be in my favor
4890363 i think it really shows that no matter what you set your imagination to anything can happen if you dream as big as you can dream anything is possible i saw so many quotes saying its impossible to duplicate it it wont happen it just shows you that anything can happen i never really i guess before i got to bob hes the one who really helped me really dream about anything yes i wanted to become an olympic gold medalist yes i wanted to become a world record holder a professional athletes until i really got with him he was the one who really said dream big dream as big as you can it finally happened ive been able to have a lot of hard work and bob and i have gone through a lot together its all paid off
4890364 tomorrow is definitely not going to be an easy race australia has a very good relay were going to do like we did the last two relays its all about being a team were going to go out there as a team and swim as a team well be able to swim as a team thats not a problem hopefully were able to put four amazing splits together and see what happens
4890365 the timing system says it all there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that i remember i have no idea the only thing i can say is i raced as hard as i could and i swam my best the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4890366 when people say things like that it fires me up more than anything just like 400 free relay going into that we were excited because the french swimmers had said a few remarks that got us a little excited we use things like that and comments like that to fuel us to get us more excited i think thats what american swimmers do we rise to the occasion when bob told me that actually this morning i said ok well let our swimming do the talking thats how ive always done it i always welcome comments if anyone wants to say anything i like it it definitely motivates me even more
4890367 i knew i had to be within half a body length racing against crocker racing against someone who has front half speed i race against him all the time im sort of able to judge where im able to be at the 50 meter mark to make up i figured if i was about a half a body length behind i would be fine when i turned i saw crocker how far ahead he was of me i kind of figured him and cavic were out at the same speed i could kind of see him out of the side of my eye but thats about it i had no idea where he was
4890368 i had no idea there was a protest beats me nothing to say to that thats the first word that ive heard of it
4890369 ive said this before and ill say it again my big goal is to change the sport of swimming in a way for the kids coming up in the sport and also for of the sport in america i actually just got a picture my friend sent me sportscenter live they aired the race somebody else told me they had it on jumbotron live in the middle of a baseball game so my goal is starting to happen but there is still a long way to go with that im sure bob and i can think of something in the next four years
4890370 im not doing it for the money im doing it because i love what i do this is something i dreamed of as soon as i started swimming winning an olympic gold medal in athens i was able to do that i was able to surpass my goals
4890371 we have got to that stage in the investigation it is now a strong possibility we are much closer than we were
4890372 it is now a strong possibility we are much closer than we were

4890399 to see korea this is the place to go to see their best players same with taiwan its a matter of seeing all the better players in the world in one venue
4890400 you never know when any talent is going to be available so you have to constantly keep in check
4890401 its a couple of things one you look to try to see if theres somebody you can sign now and two for the future
4890402 some clubs will have no players some will have eight or 10 and some will be available and some wont be available
4890403 if you went to japan it might take you a month to see all those guys
4890404 but were not skipping anybody you just never know sometimes guys at a young age throw 85 86 mph and three or four years later you see them again and theyre throwing in the lows 90s

4890410 have you ever seen anything like that before did you ever think youd see anything like that
4890411 freak of nature you guys come up with a better word and ill use it i promise
4890412 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4890413 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4890414 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4890415 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4890416 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4890417 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4890418 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4890419 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4890420 this is a planning took where all things are going
4890421 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4890422 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4890423 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4890424 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4890425 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4890426 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4890427 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4890428 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4890429 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4890430 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4890431 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4890432 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4890433 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4890434 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4890435 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4890436 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4890437 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4890438 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4890439 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4890440 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4890441 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4890442 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4890443 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4890444 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4890445 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4890446 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4890447 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4890448 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4890449 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4890450 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4890451 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4890452 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4890453 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4890454 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4890455 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4890456 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4890457 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4890458 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4890459 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4890460 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4890461 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4890462 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4890463 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4890464 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4890465 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4890466 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4890467 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4890468 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4890469 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4890470 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4890471 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4890472 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4890473 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4890474 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4890475 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4890476 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4890477 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4890478 bueno querida es muy simple te tom s la pastilla y nos olvidamos del asunto
4890479 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4890480 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4890481 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4890482 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4890483 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4890484 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4890485 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4890486 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4890487 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4890488 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4890489 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4890490 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4890491 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4890492 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4890493 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4890494 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4890495 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4890496 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4890497 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4890498 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4890499 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4890500 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4890501 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4890502 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4890503 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4890504 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4890505 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4890506 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4890507 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4890508 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4890509 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4890510 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4890511 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4890512 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4890513 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4890514 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4890515 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4890516 american charges of russian aggression ring hollow georgia started this fight russia finished it
4890517 im staying here even if georgians come and kill me
4890518 the triad appears to have prevailed because of old fashion capitalism that values its more centralized location its moving up in stature as a cargo center as the fedex hub nears completion logistics today magazine in its rating of the 50 top logistics friendly cities and metropolitan areas ranked greensboro high point tops in the state and 20th in the southeast last year up from 31st in 2005 it passed charlotte gastonia concord which slipped from 18th in the southeast in 2005 to 22nd raleigh cary came in 28th in the southeast in the latest ranking

4890521 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of training that i did wasnt enough
4890522 my legs have just gone i didnt do all that work for nothing but its just frustrating
4890523 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4890524 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4890525 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4890526 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4890527 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4890528 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4890529 y ha puesto eternidad en el coraz n de ellos

4890572 the georgian south ossetian conflict issue was considered during a meeting of the russian security council and the president informed those attending that he had just signed the plan based on the six principles
4890573 we are somewhat bewildered by the fact that the document signed by saakashvili differs from the document worked out by the presidents of russia and france so the issue is still to be specified via diplomatic channels

4890577 i want to inform you of a first hand news today the americans sanctioned us 28 years ago but that is not the whole story
4890578 they also imposed a number of sets of embargoes whose single purpose was the block the path of our progress but thanks to all those sanctions we are now a nuclear country and will by grace of god very soon launch our first iranian made satellite
4890579 this satellite the rocket that would launch it and the land station from which it would be launched are entirely made in iran by the talented iranian scientists and technicians
4890580 this membership is in the first place going to benefit the eu and in the second place it is to the benefit of the region since turkey is a great civilization building country whose membership would benefit them in strengthening their ties with the the region
4890581 turkey is an important and trustworthy connection bridge but notice how many preconditions they the europeans set for turkeys eu membership it is because they do not want our countries to became advanced
4890582 i wish to summarize my feelings regearing iran turkey relations in a couple of sentences we believe iran and turkey can complete the shortcomings of one another and their cooperation would lead to the emergence of a big power at the service of security of the region and the world peace
4890583 we need to strengthen our beliefs in the might of ourselves and to pave the long path towards the peaks of pride resolutely
4890584 our future world and navy will be a better place because of your sacrifices
4890585 it is inspiring to meet the leaders of your organization
4890586 he is definitely someone that has been in our shoes he cares about sailors
4890587 the navy really brings a lot of technical experience to bear in dealing with complex situations
4890588 you are all doing great things on behalf of your nation
4890589 weve invested a lot time and effort into our individual augmentees and global support augmentee sailors and none of you have let us down yet said campa

4890591 an urgent proposition to launch talks and draw up an agreement to regulate bilateral relations during military operations
4890592 the 34th peshmerga brigade will leave diyala to join the 15th mountain division within kurdistan
4890593 the president of russia has clearly stated that after all that had happened neither abkhazians nor south ossetians will accept georgians as peacekeepers on their territories
4890594 only russian peacekeepers will be allowed in south ossetia and abkhazia
4890595 there will be no georgian peacekeepers on south ossetian territory
4890596 we will be able to resupply the ships at sea with our increased capacity moving larger cargo in shorter time
4890597 this ship is designed not only for future strategic planning but also sea basing the ability to help sustain large expeditionary forces
4890598 were excited at having this new ship and learning all that its capable of doing
4890599 we understand the food situation in gori has now become desperate
4890600 from the day that the russian tank brigade raced through the tunnel into south ossetia russia has not made one wrong move
4890601 a brilliant and brutal display of russias national game chess
4890602 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future but these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4890603 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations there is no room for debate on this matter
4890604 in order to stabilize the situation in georgia we need international observers on the scene fast and eventually we need a more robust and impartial international peacekeeping force that would follow those monitors i count on russian cooperation in getting those monitors in
4890605 never georgia will succumb to their pressures never ever we will surrender never ever we will give up our freedom and independence never ever we will give any piece of our territory and freedom will go to every part of georgia to every ethnic group to every community in georgia and we will definitely get rid of this invaders for good i am totally convinced of that one
4890606 we came from the black sea to reach our airplane in armenia
4890607 i dont want to die here and stay i cant
4890608 the document that was signed yesterday by mikheil saakashvili differs from the document that was agreed by presidents medvedev and sarkozy in moscow
4890609 so this issue has to be clarified through diplomatic channels
4890610 i have already stated that this withdrawal will take place when extra security measures have been put into place on the ground along the positions of the peacekeeping contingent
4890611 we insist that georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected
4890612 and moscow must honor its pledge to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4890613 international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4890614 we are 24 people living in a small room we need food children have not eaten bread for five days
4890615 while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process i have been gratified that both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that is important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
4890616 so we will have in poland not one american garrison but two american garrisons
4890617 we will have one base used to protect the whole of nato against long range ballistic missiles and we will also have a battery of 96 patriot missiles located in a spot chosen by poland according to our defense needs
4890618 we would start with a battery under u s command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4890619 when one party agrees to host a foreign facility of course it assumes certain responsibilities and were talking about a military facility in this case so there is additional responsibility
4890620 certainly any facility is the target excuse me i mean the subject of the interests of another country so of course one has to be careful with that a bordering country always makes it its priority to strike such installations in case of conflict so it is not simply it cannot go unpunished from the point of view of its military use and so on
4890621 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond adequately
4890622 were facing a new international situation the situation does not change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4890623 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw you own conclusions
4890624 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond adequately
4890625 were facing a new international situation the situation does not change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4890626 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw you own conclusions
4890627 foreign countries interested in getting information about the situation in space
4890628 as for the black sea fleet we adhere to agreements that were signed by both sides those agreements clearly defined the status of our black sea fleet in sevastopol and were not called into question until the ukrainian side changed its mind
4890629 obviously we need negotiations in a bilateral format again in order to reach an agreement
4890630 when one party agrees to host a foreign facility of course it assumes certain responsibilities and were talking about a military facility in this case so there is additional responsibility
4890631 certainly any facility is the target excuse me i mean the subject of the interests of another country so of course one has to be careful with that
4890632 a bordering country always makes it its priority to strike such installations in case of conflict so it is not simply it cannot go unpunished from the point of view of its military use and so on
4890633 we have been given shelter at least one part of my family the children have proper food the place is clean but it was very crowded there were very few places there
4890634 people who had to flee their homes come to our office i have to say that our work is very difficult and its very difficult too for these people who have obviously been under stress
4890635 many of them come to us because theyve lost contact with their loved ones and thats something were now working on helping them restore family links what might be coming soon and its obvious theres a need for that is psycho social assistance to the displaced population
4890636 we went down to the basement after the fighting started we spent three days there in the dark without either water or bread among us was a 4 month old baby a pregnant woman elderly people children
4890637 we sat there in anguish while heavy artillery was being fired we didnt even see the light of day then someone came from another building and told us that a humanitarian corridor had opened and that we should run for our lives
4890638 we ran out and what we saw was terrible all the houses were destroyed schools and buildings were ablaze
4890639 now we are being sent here and there but well probably go back to our native city even if the houses are in ruins well build a shack and live in it and help our people
4890640 the first thing we did was to feed people at the monasterys gates this went on for the whole time the sisters got almost no sleep now we are working hard on redistributing all the aid that is brought to the monastery
4890641 at the beginning there were mostly women and children but now there are very old people whom i dont how to look in the eye after living their lives building their houses at age 70 or 80 they have to leave for unfamiliar places
4890642 several of the citys residential districts are severely damaged government buildings suffered extensive damaged we saw traces of strikes aimed at basements in which people were hiding and were then trapped for several days we saw houses whose basement walls had been breached by armored personnel carriers
4890643 we saw undeniable signs that the grad missile system a nonprecision weapon was used there is no doubt whatsoever that the rights of tskhinvalis civilian population were severely violated
4890644 we were told that 273 injured people were brought to this hospital from tskhinvali and its outskirts concerning the number of dead the number cited was 44 south ossetian residents
4890645 doctors are positive that all the south ossetians killed were brought to this hospital they are convinced that the number of dead is not much higher otherwise they would know about it
4890646 it was very tough they started threatening us and expelled our daughter from school they threatened to either kill us or blow up the school they smashed the windows of the school thats in the russian sector they started dragging us out of our flats our rooms
4890647 minute saakashvili signed that document russian forces would begin to withdraw
4890648 yeah i mostly stick to a shot and a beer but its new years when i was growin up we always had champagne on new years while we watched the ball drop i still make sure to have a bottle in time for the end of december
4890649 whos the genius who thought replacing dick clark with ryan seacrest was a good idea
4890650 i get that but why replace him with this guy i mean dick clark did american bandstand all this guys done is deny that hes gay
4890651 dude you are not equating being on that lame ass star search wannabe show with hosting american bandstand are you
4890652 eventually the long term plan is to remove dick clarks brain from his own body and place it inside seacrests head
4890653 were supposed to be celebrating and youve been a gloomy gus
4890654 well thanks for that gomer pyle but well i guess ive just been thinking
4890655 just gives me a happy is all i mean how often do you get to kill a god much less two
4890656 only reason the stake worked was cause nobodyd worshipped those two for centuries godsre only powerful when people believe in em you meet zeus in a dark alley he probably couldnt muster up a lightning bolt but a couple thousand years ago hed fry you soon as look atcha
4890657 good to have a quiet week surprised really i mean youd think thered be something attached to the new year that would get the spirits panties in a bunch
4890658 its a human construct spirits tend toward more natural things phases of the moon solstice equinox alignment of the stars that kind of thing
4890659 well ill certainly take the time off to drink champagne out of a whiskey glass and watch ryan seacrest be boring
4890660 time to move on to the hard stuff wouldnt you say
4890661 got a bottle of johnny walker black that ellen got me a good deal on
4890662 okay yeah sure well check it out itll be me and my brother this time yeah i got a brother sam youll love sammy trust me cool seeya
4890663 youre not actually takin that hippie burnout seriously are you
4890664 cah mon bobby i admit hes a little freaky deaky but the guy knows his stuff
4890665 yaphet the poet is someone dad and i met down in key west while you were at stanford
4890666 he sets up somewhere on duval street selling his poetry and he keeps an eye on the weird stuff
4890667 and yes he lived through the sixties so good he never left and hes not always big with the specifics but if theres something wacky going on in the keys he usually knows about it
4890668 youre both too young look i aint gonna stop you from following up on this but you might want to wait until a real case comes along
4890669 this might be real bobby yaphet says that spooks have been on overdrive for the last six months or so
4890670 mostly its been more hauntings key west has more ghost stories than anyplace this side of new orleans plus a weird death girl got her throat slit and there was sulfur on the wound according to yaphet
4890671 lets check on this weird death from here before you go on down to florida
4890672 cause the absolute last thing i want to do is leave the twenty degree temps here and drive to a place thats famous for sun warm weather live music and partying
4890673 waitasec if youre agreeing with me somethings gotta be wrong
4890674 very funny look if its a real job we should go if it isnt itll probably be fun
4890675 key west is always fun and this time were gonna appreciate it properly
4890676 fine do what you want but i assume you aint gonna go till morning anyhow right
4890677 say what sam if we leave now well make better time
4890678 a glass of champagne and a couple beers ive driven just fine with more booze in my system ill be fine
4890679 plus its new years eve so theres bound to be lots of crazy people driving lets get a good nights sleep and hit the road in the morning
4890680 yeah all right i guess the sun shines on a dogs ass every once in a while
4890681 no problem i just hope this isnt a wild goose chase
4890682 yeah well be careful theres a reason why the place has so many ghost stories lotta spiritual energy on that island if there is a demon that got out of the gate workin down there it could be real bad
4890683 i know but weve got the be all right hey weve already faced down two gods and the seven deadly sins we should be able to handle this
4890684 our duty is to act decisively and make sure we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
4890685 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4890686 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
4890687 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
4890688 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
4890689 russia wants international recognition and respect we must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt
4890690 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4890691 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
4890692 they say they have taken off all 13 and they are all safe and well
4890693 it s good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help
4890694 so the arrangements for his mission are still being discussed with georgian authorities as well as the russian federation from georgia he will go to moscow after that it is not clear
4890695 we anticipate that if the situation calms down that a lot of the internally displaced say from gori could go back we would assume they would go back fairly quickly what they find when they get back is a different question
4890696 they may need shelter assistance and help in rebuilding some of the damaged buildings there unhcr has flown in tents including winterized tents which could be used if necessary
4890697 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
4890698 but our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4890699 the verbal assurance that president medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped or were going to stop or were stopping or whatever the tense was clearly was not honored
4890700 and so this is going to be a signed agreement and i have to assume that the president of russia having given not just his word but his signature to the president of the eu will honor it
4890701 we are under a russian invasion and russian occupation right now and we want to end the russian invasion and occupation
4890702 this is a cease fire agreement between us and russia facilitated by france and the united states and we certainly should move from this temporary arrangement to a genuine international peacekeeping force on the ground
4890703 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4890704 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4890705 now for the first time in memory europe is becoming a continent that is whole free and at peace unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests the opposite is true free and prosperous societies on russias borders will advance russias interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity
4890706 this decision demonstrates clearly everything we have been saying recently the deployment of new missile defense forces in europe targets the russian federation and it has been done at the suitable moment
4890707 and so the fairy tales about a deterrent against other countries the fairy tales about these installations deterring some rogue countries do not work
4890708 our partners should understand absolutely clearly what happened and what the consequences of these events are they shouldnt look for only one side to blame and they certainly shouldnt blame everything on russia but they should do everything to minimize the consequences of this tragic event
4890709 on our part we are ready to work with everyone in an open and absolutely good hearted manner and we do not want to scale back our relations with anybody
4890710 no one is rejecting the principle of territorial integrity as one of the fundamental principles of international law
4890711 the question is about a concrete situation in a concrete country and here is where the main difficulties begin unfortunately after what happened the ossetians and the abkhaz will hardly want to live in the same state with georgians
4890712 the ossetians and the abkhaz themselves trust nobody else but russian peacekeepers
4890713 security council resolutions that recognize abkhazia and ossetia as within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
4890714 this isnt a matter of there is now some new political status for abkhazia and south ossetia that is absolutely not the case
4890715 the circumstances are those that are in the security council resolutions of the past
4890716 i have made it very clear that it is normal to protest when there are casualties in a conflict and unfortunately in this case there are many many victims
4890717 but even if you were to accept the russian version of what the georgians are alleged to have done in south ossetia i must say that i consider some of the reactions by russia to be disproportionate
4890718 russian forces are not letting georgian police in so far but we keep contact with them and try to convince them that that is the only way to restore order
4890719 it would take another week or so for them to completely pull out
4890720 every citizen has the opportunity to enter gori even with their own cars which was virtually impossible yesterday this has been agreed upon with the russian peacekeepers gori is beginning to function in a normal way local administration and the governors office have started to work shops will open today which is very important for people bakeries will also start working again civilians face no threat
4890721 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia
4890722 the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
4890723 i think the russians took the wrong lessons from bucharest
4890724 there was a lot of russian pressure and rhetoric against both georgia and ukraine getting membership action plans before bucharest ive heard that russians regard bucharest as a success and what you saw after bucharest was an increase in pressure
4890725 what russia really wants is essentially to be able to do as it pleases in world affairs and to answer to nobody
4890726 it wants a totally free hand particularly in and around the cis it also needs to conjure up the idea of an enemy to justify its regime the fact of the matter is that the most immediate threat here is to georgia because the russian government could pack forces into the north caucasus to threaten georgia
4890727 we heard statements that the russian railroad troops that had entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there on a humanitarian mission and now we know the truth about why those forces were there it was to rebuild the railroad to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
4890728 i am afraid that there is a very strong possibility that military activity will happen this year probably in the next month
4890729 this is a war that russia wanted and clearly had planned for
4890730 the evidence ive seen indicates that the russian army was sitting there waiting for this that this was essentially a provocation launched by the south ossetians who ratcheted up the level of violence in order to bring the georgians who are easily provokable obviously to attack
4890731 and the russians were waiting there ready with an operational plan and with forces in place land sea and air to do what they have subsequently done
4890732 it is difficult to imagine that russia prepared such a provocation while neither of the countrys two leaders was in moscow
4890733 it is also difficult to imagine that russia prepared to go to war and then when saakashvili fell into the trap waited 13 or 14 hours by my count before deploying forces
4890734 russias policies over the past several years caused this war and for this they bear responsibility
4890735 oh sorry i was just doing the math in my head
4890736 there are over 86 million blogs and each one has an rss feed all it takes is a few subscriptions to the sites that interest you and your feed reader is overwhelmed with a never ending stream of hundreds of headlines like an aide or a personal assistant aiderss helps to filter and rank these feeds based on a number of criteria to help you read what matters ensure that you find the good stuff and to help keep things organized and manageable
4890737 the general assembly is going to consider it this coming autumn i hope that the majority of member states of the u n will support serbias request
4890738 serbia has asked for the advisory opinion of the icj because serbia strongly believes international law was violated that the security council resolution 1244 was violated that the u n charter was violated that the helsinki final act was violated by kosovos unilateral declaration of independence
4890739 since we are the party that is seeking the icjs opinion we are saying we believe in the icj
4890740 we believe in international institutions we are going to respect the ruling of international institutions
4890741 it probably makes them as serious and as bad as theyve been since the cold war ended since the early mikhail gorbachev days
4890742 now that kind of engagement that kind of strategic dialogue becomes far more difficult because political sentiment in the united states and in europe has again seen russia as a fundamental problem even potentially a threat and an adversary and needs to be treated as such
4890743 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest
4890744 and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4890745 we need russia in a number of different areas in balkan policy in our relations with iran and trying to prevent the development of nuclear power in iran
4890746 so we dont want to jeopardize that relationship and yet by encouraging georgia particularly by promoting georgias entry into nato we have seriously antagonized the russians and now we dont have that many cards to play basically the ball is in russias court
4890747 i dont see why not you have my resume my ecq and the candidate assessment that essentially answers all of your questions
4890748 for profit or non profit government or non government accounting is accounting is accounting
4890749 if there are three suckas over here and two suckas over here and mr t smashes all the suckas whats gonna happen
4890750 i think it looks a little hokey if you ask me
4890751 the campaign by the union movement continues to run to ensure that we remind the electorate that we are still a long way from restoring fairness and balance to australias workplaces
4890752 i stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way you see the world looks very differently from up here dont believe me come see for yourselves
4890753 the average person has about 3 to 5 dreams per night but some may have up to 7 dreams in one night
4890754 there was nothing to point at him as far as not doing things right
4890755 it was either things werent there or a guy wasnt making plays for him i thought he played extremely well when you look at his composure his energy his excitement
4890756 thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl
4890757 played the best of all our receivers against tennessee and helped his chances to make the team kiffin said he had three receptions for 45 yards
4890758 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4890759 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4890760 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4890761 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4890762 the inventory of unsold homes on the market is so high 11 months supply for existing homes 10 for new homes that sellers will have to lower their expectations before the market can return to normal which analysts generally see as a five month supply
4890763 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
4890764 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4890765 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4890766 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4890767 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4890768 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4890769 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4890770 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4890771 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4890772 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4890773 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4890774 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4890775 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4890776 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4890777 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4890778 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4890779 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4890780 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4890781 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4890782 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4890783 its probably the biggest event on the sporting calendar in australia and one of the biggest events on the calendar overall so it is a tremendous honour
4890784 weve had so many offers to do these kinds of performances in the past but it has never timed well with our other commitments it seems that the right time is now and we are working on a few ideas to make it a really special performance

4890819 has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although we have been the best at it
4890820 not because i am pro abortion but ultimately because i dont think women make these decisions casually
4890821 in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept of gospel author matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4890822 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4890823 but now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4890824 i have to assume for now that the word of the president of russia to the presidency of the eu is going to be respected

4890861 youre gonna put cortez ward over trepagnier a guy i used to look up to when i watched usc play
4890862 they might overlook remix much like they did last week against b junkies but theyre playing against a team that has a chip on their shoulder
4890863 i remembered that game thats when relics started respecting mosley for what hes doing on the court
4890864 were playing differently this season and were off to a great start were 3 0 i guess you can say were back

4890874 nah you know hell get butt hurt if he knows we wanted to trade him
4890875 we didnt drive all the way to anaheim for nothing at least give us a team that will play
4890876 should the game come down to free throws primetime will be looking at a loss since free throws has been their achilles heel as of late
4890877 look for 562 renegades to play like they have something to prove as palella recently asked the commish who he thinks the best team in gold is
4890878 i couldnt respond to the comment he posted since everyone will think im playing favorites
4890879 the best team in gold is thrillers because they have the division leading scorer
4890880 where all the unemployeed and illegal immigrants go for free healthcare for any condition ranging from dead guy to hang nail

4890998 you know its okay to bat for the other team ron
4890999 for the love of ron has it escaped your notice that we are trying to make our house cleaner tell me exactly how does throwing your dirty laundry about the place do that
4891000 please just put it in the hamper next time please
4891001 i cannot believe my parents do this without magic i cant believe i used to do this without magic next year no spring cleaning im making a decree
4891002 no were both all sweaty and i need a shower im sure i must smell simply awful
4891003 mmm no you smell good like a woman should smell
4891004 oh hello there so nice to see you again its lavender isnt it
4891005 so how did your young man like his christmas present
4891006 he said he liked it but ive never seen him wear it
4891007 if you and he would like to exchange the necklace for something more to his liking ill do all i can to help it can be very difficult to know just what sort of thing a young man would like
4891008 i think i think there might be be somebody else
4891009 i sort of had a feeling it might happen hes always spending time with that hermi well its not important besides i guess she must have loads of gold that ring looked really expensive
4891010 i only wish i could have gotten an emerald for him too it looks so nice with his ginger hair
4891011 my friends all told me i was being stupid i guess they were right
4891012 unfortunately our hearts are never quite as clever as our friends are they
4891013 youre so kind mr sardonyx im sorry i bothered you with this
4891014 i assure you my dear im not at all bothered we can all use a sympathetic ear from time to time youd be amazed how many crying men ive consoled as they returned unaccepted engagement rings
4891015 that there may be more than a few young men around here who hold you in high regard i hope you wont let this experience blind you to other possibilities youre much too young to abandon all hope
4891016 give yourself a gift and let them fight over you a bit youve earned it
4891017 that was your first time and first times can be both terrifying and exhilarating but i promise that ill be a bit more forceful should your eyes light on anything less than perfect in my shop
4891018 well peridot can i tear you away from miss brown for a spot of lunch
4891019 i didnt mean to keep mr sardonyx from his lunch
4891020 i thoroughly enjoyed our chat and i hope to see you again soon just be sure to let any appropriate parties know that i pride myself on my custom made engagement rings and wedding bands
4891021 i havent seen her look so buoyant in a month
4891022 if youll forgive my saying so i still remember you stooping under a similar burden not all that long ago
4891023 i only wish that there had been someone there at the time i could have
4891024 it can be so difficult at that age not certain who will understand without judging so often i have to restrain myself from intruding into a students feelings knowing how badly he needs to speak of them but at the same time feeling as if he is alone as if nobody could truly understand then i remember that i am the headmaster and so it is unlikely that any student would feel free to confide in me
4891025 then again find me the teenager who thinks we old folk know anything about love
4891026 would you mind dining with me in my study instead of with the rest of the school
4891027 peridot this is dobby a free elf in the employ of hogwarts
4891028 dobby this is mr peridot sardonyx my guest for the day
4891029 dobby mr sardonyx and i will be lunching in my study today
4891030 would you please arrange to have food brought up to us
4891031 dobby will see to it at once would master dumbledore like oak matured mead with lunch
4891032 knowing the three broomsticks was your tavern of choice it didnt require a great deal of thought to know who to ask about your preferences as i understand it she keeps a stock of this particular mead in reserve just for you
4891033 in gratitude for your kindness i shall ask her to allow you the occasional bottle as well do try not to deplete the stock though eh
4891034 well i do enjoy a good mead from time to time but not so much that i would leave you high and dry
4891035 despite how elegantly dobby has arranged the room i dont stand on ceremony
4891036 i see youve noticed my little handicap i am sorry and i hope it wont put you off your food
4891037 lets just say i should have chosen my jeweler more carefully
4891038 i assure you our house elves are as talented as you no doubt remember in fact i often feel we are quite spoiled here at hogwarts
4891039 dobby wasnt sure what the masters would like so i brought a selection
4891040 there is a reason ive asked you to dine privately with me peridot
4891041 this whole meal might pass more pleasantly if you were to call me albus or dumbledore if that would be easier
4891042 you have to know how difficult either would be albus
4891043 it seemed easy enough at the three broomsticks but here at hogwarts i was your student for seven years its difficult for me to think of you as anything but my superior
4891044 after having watched you with miss brown today i suspect you are my superior in many ways
4891045 ive never been much for reading newspapers but in the last few weeks ive started taking the daily prophet
4891046 i am but a resource for the one who must ultimately and finally defeat him
4891047 harry potter what young harry must still learn cannot be taught by me or any other teacher at this school this in fact is why i wished to speak with you he needs your help
4891048 i dont understand what i could possibly do for him
4891049 the problem is that most people are very confused about what true power is mr potter among them no after what i saw this afternoon i am convinced that you are in a unique position to help you are in fact the only person i know of who could perform this particular service
4891050 i know about you and that order of the phoenix business im just a jeweler im rubbish at charms ive never learned to duel and if you recall youre the reason i never took a n e w t in transfiguration i doubt theres much i could do against you know who
4891051 i would not presume to ask you to join the order of the phoenix nor to take a public stand against voldemort
4891052 not directly at any rate i promise that if you can assist me there will be no repercussions there will be no way for voldemort or his followers to know you had done anything at all
4891053 its not that i dont want to help its just that i think there have to be people better qualified than me
4891054 you dont even know what im going to ask you yet
4891055 once you do i think youll understand why you are particularly well qualified
4891056 i confess i didnt realize how true that was until i witnessed your interaction with miss brown
4891057 it hurts you to see others hurting hopefully that is true of most people but it runs deeper for you i saw your face when miss brown was speaking to you you werent simply being sympathetic you were truly empathetic you felt her pain
4891058 no one could see that much hurt and not want to help
4891059 but i think we both know how wrong you are
4891060 there was a time in your own life when you sorely could have used someone like yourself only to find yourself alone
4891061 you were always kind to me after everyone found out that i about me you were the only teacher in the whole school who never acted like you were judging me or were disappointed or disgusted
4891062 yes sadly the best thing you can find to say about me is that i did nothing
4891063 i knew you were in pain knew you needed someone to talk to and instead all i did was smile and say good morning each day choosing to ignore the pain written across your face
4891064 and no matter what you think i was grateful i still am and dont think that ive forgotten who it was who recommended me to madam tourmaline
4891065 that was little more than a pathetic attempt to salve my own conscience
4891066 it was in the end the very least i could do since i had missed the opportunity to do more
4891067 oh please dont misunderstand i admit to having been uniquely situated to drop the right word to the right person at the right time and i promise you that paraiba tourmaline has more than once thanked me for recommending you to her even if you have managed to arrogate a fair share of her business in recent years
4891068 but i say again i regret not having been of more help to you while you were still a student of this school
4891069 i could have told you that there is nothing wrong with love true honest sincere love
4891070 i could have told you not to allow others to make you believe your love was wrong or disordered not even the one you loved
4891071 but as i said before when i was seventeen would i really have listened to someone who was
4891072 perhaps not still i believe i had the wherewithal to make you believe i could at least understand your pain i wont claim that i could have relieved it but i could have helped you bear it i know you were not without friends but hearing a young lady lament unrequited affections for a young man is hardly the same thing is it
4891073 not on some vague intellectual level but from the standpoint of experience
4891074 i was not always the asexual being that you and your schoolmates presumed i must be
4891075 i have no intention of polluting your mind with images you might spend years trying to purge my intention is simply to explain that while i was qualified i was also unable or rather unwilling to help you for fear of exposing myself
4891076 i can offer no other explanation but to say that times were different then less tolerant and so while i never added my voice to those who derided you i did very little to defend you in short i was handed a responsibility and i failed miserably and not a day has passed that i have not regretted it
4891077 i was a human being watching another human being bear his agony alone
4891078 albus dumbledore i understand and i forgive you who knows things might have been different if you had been more forthcoming back then but its a waste of time to dwell on what might have been we all have regrets weve all made what we know or consider to be mistakes but there comes a time when we have to put them behind us and simply get on with our lives
4891079 and for what its worth it meant the world to me that you treated me no differently once you knew i might have been rubbish at transfiguration but your class was always a respite for me a place where i knew i would only be judged on my skills such as they were and not on my sexuality
4891080 and once again my friend if i may call you my friend
4891081 you prove yourself my superior even now though ive done nothing to deserve it you cannot stand to see me hurting without doing everything in your power to help alleviate my pain and dont argue just because it comes so naturally to you doesnt mean it isnt a rare and precious quality
4891082 you still havent told me why it is that you invited me here today
4891083 i felt that my request required a context if you were to fully understand its immense importance
4891084 in doing so however i fear i have disrupted a fine meal if you like i can ask dobby to bring us more hot food or perhaps a dessert
4891085 i do have a way of doing that im afraid very well since weve wasted the meat on our plates lets get to the meat of the matter
4891086 did you by chance hear the password i used for admittance to my study
4891087 normally i would choose the name of whatever particular confection i happened to fancy at the moment since i have a notoriously voracious sweet tooth my choice of passwords seemed limited only by the selection at honeydukes sweetshop however i instituted the current password the day after we were so well met at the three broomsticks i cant tell you how happy i was to see you that evening though if i had not i would likely have come by your shop during that week i was curious you see as to the origin and circumstances of the rings i had seen on harry potters and ronald weasleys hands
4891088 as i told you before that is neither your concern nor your responsibility i assure you that matter is being addressed after our conversation that evening however a number of questions had been answered not the least of which was whether the boys had purchased the rings together or separately
4891089 that ronald weasley would walk into a jewelry shop alone and buy a mans ring for someone else
4891090 yes i believe thats highly significant youd have no way of knowing of course but ronald has shown great courage during his years at hogwarts he has faced dangers that would have bested many adult wizards seen three members of his family attacked by voldemort and his minions stood face to face with his greatest fear and risked serious injury and even his own life more than once and yet in buying a simple gold band adorned with a lapis lazuli stone i believe ronald weasley showed more courage than he ever had before
4891091 i think i see what you mean i still dont understand what that has to do with me helping harry potter
4891092 any more than youd be aware of how much youve already helped honestly what im asking of you is nothing more than youve already been doing i simply want to ensure your willingness to continue
4891093 i think ive proven that i have no idea of what youre talking about it would certainly help if you could just come right out and say what youve been hinting at all through lunch
4891094 its just that ive grown so accustomed to secrecy that i forget that among those i trust it is not necessary and is often counterproductive
4891095 ronald weasley is i think we can agree in love with harry potter
4891096 we can safely assume based on appearances that that love is requited
4891097 while there are very few of us who actually know the particulars there are those who have begun to suspect the truth of it
4891098 while it may be true that many are more tolerant than they were in your days as a student it would be foolish in the extreme to presume universal acceptance of such love
4891099 young harry and ronald might find themselves objects of gossip and even ridicule
4891100 as you so correctly pointed out not only am i their headmaster i am old no no im not overstating the fact
4891101 i am indeed quite old while failing to die for so many years has no doubt brought with it a certain degree of wisdom it has also caused me to forget much of what its like to be young my age and my position make it difficult for me to lend the sort of understanding ear both or either of these young men might someday need
4891102 is this because im because theyre gay is that what you want from me to tell them that its all right to be homosexual no matter what anyone else says
4891103 my own experience doesnt exactly place me in good stead to offer such assurances and wouldnt you as the headmaster be in a better position to help them wouldnt you be able to make more people understand that even if they cant accept someone being gay they have no right to judge couldnt you
4891104 it has nothing to do with genders or prejudices if harry potter had set his sights on some pretty young witch i would still make the same request of you
4891105 please understand that what is at stake is larger than the petty bigotry of small minds or the arbitrary boundaries that they so blithely impose on love it is love itself that i am asking you encourage
4891106 that i am pleased it is ronald weasley who holds such a singular place in harrys heart the family in which he was raised is quite possibly the single most loving in all of britain magical or muggle because of that love comes as naturally to ronald as breathing does to the rest of us
4891107 harry on the other hand was raised in an atmosphere of resentment of his very presence that most often manifested itself in neglect i seriously doubt that the word love was one he heard often growing up and im reasonably certain it was never spoken directly to him despite that he has emerged from that upbringing with an incredible ability to love others and to appreciate even the barest affection shown him in return still while he might be grateful for signs of fondness i fear he may yet have much to learn about what it is to feel loved not because hes the boy who lived but simply because he is harry potter with no grandiose qualifiers this is what i hope he can learn from ronald weasley
4891108 it is not the sort of thing that one would find in the pages of the daily prophet in fact ive worked hard to keep it that way im too familiar with the work of rita skeeter to allow her to turn harry into an object of pity over a past which he has managed to surmount so admirably much to his credit
4891109 i see by your face that you understand me now and that you doubt you can help
4891110 i however know better dont forget i watched you counsel poor miss brown and ive no doubt that you could do the same for the young men in question in fact unless i am very much mistaken youve already done so
4891111 did you forget our discussion at the three broomsticks do you believe for even a second that harry and ronald could visit hogsmeade and not be under careful scrutiny i would be a poor headmaster indeed if i allowed that to happen
4891112 ive told you its not your responsibility and i will tell you now that i am pleased that they sought you out again presuming you were your normal understanding self im sure theyll eventually realize that you are someone they can turn to should the need arise perhaps one day they will even see you as a trusted friend something to which i could never truly aspire
4891113 besides that im afraid that the time is coming soon when they will not be able to ask my help even if they should be so inclined
4891114 suffice to say where i am going they cannot follow must not follow not yet at any rate therefore i am asking you clearly and definitively to simply be available to two young men who are no doubt struggling to sort out thoughts and feelings that are at once as terrifying as they are exhilarating
4891115 i understand what youre asking and i can assure you that i will do my best to help ron and harry in any way i can
4891116 that youd have done so even if i hadnt asked i have no doubt
4891117 i suppose all i wanted to do was stress the importance of the matter if harry potter doesnt come to understand the power of love then i fear for him and for all of us i truly believe that he has much to learn from ronald in that respect anything that anyone can do to encourage harry to fully explore his emotions will be of inestimable value and you neednt fear voldemort i suspect that even he would encourage your involvement in this matter
4891118 vol he who must not be named encourage me helping harry potter
4891119 he would in fact he does consider such love a weakness rather than a strength this i believe is why ultimately he cannot prevail he places all his hopes in dark magic and power having no idea what true power is the day harry potter understands it is the day when he will already have defeated the greatest evil of the age
4891120 i will help him as much as i can for as long as i can after that it will be up to his friends and you to help him find within himself whatever proof he needs that love is his greatest strength
4891121 might be a lot to ask of a simple jeweler
4891122 were you merely a simple jeweler i assure you we would not be having this conversation as it is you are in so many ways a remarkable man whose talents are only partially expressed in gold and gemstones though they are remarkable as well
4891123 you didnt see the horrible necklace lavender brown bought for ron weasley
4891124 thats true i did not whos to say however that even that didnt play a role maybe it helped ronald to realize his heart belonged to another
4891125 and that she will soon enough be the center of another young mans universe
4891126 as you so wisely pointed out the last time we met youth and love are a formidable combination they will undoubtedly cause some young man to overcome his trepidation and ronald weasley will be tallied as a learning experience albeit an important one
4891127 not only have they found one another but theyve found you as well
4891128 we were hoping you could fix them up for us
4891129 loads of people have said how much they like them
4891130 i told everybody where to go for this kind of stuff even before they saw the rings
4891131 that must be why i saw so many hogwarts students this year had i known you were so good at publicity i might have given you a discount
4891132 but i am still at something of a loss the rings require some sort of repair
4891133 we wanted to know if you can yknow scratch names inside and that sort of thing
4891134 perhaps it is time we were formally introduced peridot sardonyx at your service sirs
4891135 have you decided on what you would like engraved in your rings
4891136 i guess we need to know how much you can put in
4891137 they are fairly large rings and so we would have some options still its always best to keep it brief
4891138 a ring is no place for some long declaration of your undying lo
4891139 anything said here is kept in the strictest confidence trust me you are not the first couple nor will you be the last to have this sort of conversation in this shop
4891140 see ron mr sardonyx understands now lets decide this we have quidditch practice in less than an hour
4891141 oh dont be embarrassed you are clearly built like a seeker i imagine youre quite fast on a broom
4891142 harrys the best seeker hogwarts ever had everyone says it you should come up and watch us play sometime mr sardonyx
4891143 and please call me peridot and what position do you play ron
4891144 our keeper i mean and hes bloody good at it too
4891145 they would both have several layers of meaning for you i would think seeking and keeping are two rather evocative images
4891146 i mean i like my seeker but i want it to say something about both of us
4891147 ah gentlemen im happy to say that your items are ready for your inspection
4891148 i just thought that you might want to give them to one another again i would be so honored if i could hear you read the inscriptions aloud
4891149 they really are thanks so much peridot oh i forgot we need to pay you for this
4891150 it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing
4891151 i wish you guys would get your act together just yesterday you take away my license and then today you expect me to show it to you

4891180 barack obama now says hes open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind
4891181 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh

4891187 and you do you think that youre a good example wasting your scrawny paycheck with your drinking buddies who even come drunk into the house do you think thats a good example for a little girl 10 years old
4891188 and her sister that no good with her hairy and dope crazed boyfriend always with their hands all over each other and screwing in every room in the house you think thats a good example too
4891189 we wanted to put our guys in a game like environment
4891190 we wanted to let our guys know what it is like to play at 7 00 pm and give them a walk through and a game atmosphere
4891191 we have some great playmakers on this team and our offensive line is gelling well and i think if we stay humble and take it one practice at a time were going to be ready to go on opening night against utep
4891192 expand drilling in the alaska oil reserve already designated for drilling
4891193 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards
4891194 our plan will reduce the price at the pump within 10 days by releasing oil from the 700 million barrel federal stockpile
4891195 a drill only plan that would lower oil prices by only 2 cents a gallon over 10 years

4891254 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4891255 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4891256 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4891257 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4891258 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4891259 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4891260 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4891261 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4891262 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4891263 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4891264 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4891265 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4891266 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4891267 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4891268 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4891269 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4891270 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4891271 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4891272 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4891273 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4891274 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4891275 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4891276 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4891277 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

4891279 it means you have a chance to win a lot of games
4891280 that was close but thats the way it goes sometimes an inch here or there garko said
4891281 hes a good pitcher but ive got to do a better job with first base open and a 3 2 pitch i have to figure hes not going to challenge me he threw a changeup or split i went after it i shouldnt have
4891282 i was only upset about the second homer lackey said
4891283 he always does something out there the normal person cant do oliver said about aybars acrobatic catch
4891284 that was some kind of play he made but youve got to get at least one run across there wedge said
4891285 as bad as we played we still had opportunities and didnt take advantage
4891286 i dont think you can play worse than we did early on
4891287 there are days guys catch the ball and help you it didnt affect my concentration i could not let that happen
4891288 in fact until you mentioned it i didnt think about it its good to have them both back
4891289 its real nice to see him back said cornerback richard marshall who replaced lucas when he was out
4891290 even when we were in spartanburg he was still there and i was telling him to watch my technique and let me know when my footwork is bad and when im doing something wrong
4891291 hes been helping out the corners letting us know if youre playing a little too far off or youre playing this way thats why i did this route marshall said of smith
4891292 watching film the end man on the line always blocked down on me
4891293 so once he let me come free it put up some flags something wasnt right i didnt know he was going to pitch it i actually thought it was going to be a run fake

4891297 its nothing anybody has said its off what happened this year coming off the dl its been a slow process he had only one rehab start but it just seems it doesnt feel right to him
4891298 spend as much time as you can with him because he will grow up and be out of the house before you know it
4891299 i think that he can be called michael the best olympian of all time more so not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4891300 as soon as i took the last half stroke to be honest i thought i had lost the race
4891301 and that was the difference cause if i would have glided then i would have come up short ive been lucky enough over the last four years to have two pretty good finishes in olympic finals i guess im blessed

4891338 i think that the president of the united states has an incredible responsibility in nominating people to the united states of supreme court these are lifetime positions there will be two or maybe three vacancies this nomination should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench and by the way justices alito and roberts have been some of my most recent favorites and im proud of president bush for nominates them

4891402 hes been a bit nought out of three lately so weve been doing a bit of work with him on his finishing and hopefully that will be good for his confidence
4891403 we kicked 13 so there wasnt a whole lot of scoring going on and that was an important contribution

4891405 but the murphy matchup was always going to be a difficult one for us
4891406 i thought our defensive group was pretty solid and joel in particular he was sent out to play on murphy the rest of the defenders defended who was there and it was good that he actually ran forward too and had a shot at goal

4891462 tuvimos muchas llegadas y renmates pero las ocasiones claras de gol llegaron a trav s de centros no hicimos uno contra uno ni paredes y lo ech de menos intentamos buscar soluciones arriba que no llegaron aunque a los jugadores no se les puede reprochar nada porque dieron la cara en todo momento

4891494 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this behind the scenes
4891495 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager

4891572 el oro nunca vencer al amor porque jam s har latir un coraz n
4891573 dicen que amar es dif cil amar es f cil y explicar por qu se ama es imposible
4891574 no prometas amarme por toda la eternidad no importan amores largos importa su intensidad
4891575 el que ama es aquel que irradia la sencillez y la alegr a de la entrega
4891576 y si el amor es el amor perdido c mo encontrar el amor

4891591 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4891592 peace advocates will likely have the best funded antiwar message in history
4891593 tens of millions of dollars will be raised for voter education and registration and get out the vote campaigns through the 527 committees which disseminate

4891595 connor black a 16 year old joinery student suffered a one inch stab wound to his upper left shoulder in moston lane harpurhey in the early hours
4891596 connor was a member of a loving family though he was known to the police but not for anything serious
4891597 how many offenses does it take to get noticed and known by local police at least 3 id say

4891611 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4891612 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4891613 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4891614 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention

4891625 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4891626 but now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4891627 i have to assume for now that the word of the president of russia to the presidency of the eu is going to be respected
4891628 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity

4891638 dearest darling this is a little gift to show you that i have not forgotten your birthday i chose these because i noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out if it had not been for your younger sister i would have chosen the long ones with buttons but she wears the short ones that are easy to remove these are a delicate shade but the lady i bought them from showed me a pair that she had been wearing for three weeks and they were hardly soiled i had the sales girl try them on and she really looked smart i wish i could put them on you for the first time no doubt other mens hands will touch them before i have a chance to see you again when you take them off blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing be sure to keep them on when you clean them or they might shrink i hope you will like them and will wear them for me on friday night all my love
4891639 it would be hard to find somebody to do what theyve done over 36 years
4891640 its just like getting a drink of water every year they come the front and help american legion baseball
4891641 we would hope that everything remains pretty well the same only time will tell but theyve been so good to the youth of this community
4891642 they are really at a tremendous loss when this happened to bill because everyone in the community knew him from the standpoint of what hed done
4891643 its not just that hes purchased things and provided things but hes been a gentleman hes been a person thats been concerned about other things in the community

4891679 poor lizzie has been through the mill but she has stuck at it
4891680 i think if she had been able to do the exercise we would be a lot further on than we are
4891681 but at least it has not put her back to the stage where she puts weight on and that kind of thing i am pleased and watch it are pleased it will be about another month before she can exercise again

4891685 as the economic slump begins to affect everything from food prices to mortgage repayments this research shows that financial worries are a source of stress for many
4891686 but people are making changes to the way they live like growing their own fruit and vegetables and walking and cycling more
4891687 not only is this evidence that people are adapting well to change but some of their altered habits are actually good for mental health

4891702 by the time we found out where he was it was too late he had been adopted by another family
4891703 they cant give me the name of the family that adopted chevy of course but they did contact them on friday and told them what had happened they gave the family my contact information and now i am just waiting hoping they will call me
4891704 i know that legally he belongs to this new family but i think its important that they know he wasnt abandoned or abused he is loved and we searched for him hes a great dog so im not surprised that some other family adopted him so fast but hes our dog and we miss him very much
4891705 i dont know if he just got out or if someone took him out i know he was found at a campground in peachland and thats how he came to be at the kelowna pound before being transferred to the spca
4891706 ill go on record saying it is a failure on the companys part my understanding is when chevys family moved from vancouver they were unable to remember what their password was which they needed to update the contact information on chevys chip the company wouldnt help them
4891707 they wouldnt give me any information about the old owners
4891708 while we had expected that the bigots and white supremacists would focus their anger on barack obama as the african american candidate what has happened is that both candidates are equally unacceptable to white supremacists who see them as being controlled and manipulated by the jews
4891709 in the warped conspiratorial worldview of the haters mccain and obama are equally tainted by the controlling hand of jews who they allege control the government and pull the levers of power in washington
4891710 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4891711 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4891712 i have listened to this straight through four times a day for the past month
4891713 why would you lie about how many condoms you have why would you lie about something dumb like that
4891714 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4891715 torres is a key player and he can change games
4891716 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4891717 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4891718 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4891719 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4891720 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4891721 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4891722 with love anything can happen i just wish i had more of it
4891723 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients
4891724 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
4891725 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
4891726 you know this looks good as is im too lazy to put in doors
4891727 modern man lacks the humility to accept the fact that the whole drama of history is enacted in a frame of meaning too large for human comprehension or management
4891728 a sense of modesty about the virtue wisdom and power available to us for the resolution of historys perplexities
4891729 lance and all the folks involved are looking into it and will for sure get it under control
4891730 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4891731 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
4891732 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4891733 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4891734 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4891735 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4891736 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4891737 the second world war was brought about in order to create the un
4891738 the second ammendment should be abolished we dont have it in europe and we survive and probably have a lot fewer crimes due to using fire arms and accidents like kids playing with them and those school killings too we never have understood that longing for cowboy times that everyone has in the us and that is the biggest reason i would never visit the us
4891739 instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world

4891741 let us rededicate ourselves to the military tradition of sacrifice
4891742 the constitutional role of the army is what it is a nonpolitical one
4891743 and the position of the army in all this has emerged with perfect clarity
4891744 they havent come this far in order to turn back
4891745 that would cast a cloud over the entire institution the army itself would be seen as being in the dock
4891746 soldiers are taught to look up to the army chief as an example
4891747 how can safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4891748 arrests have been made under the charges of waging war against the state and also for murder both unbailable offenses
4891749 this trip has reinforced my po sition on the need for a renewed focus on the nations arctic do main and the coast guards capa bility and capacity to meet our sovereign and statutory responsi bilities for the safety and security of that domain
4891750 we are moving for ward responsibly and deliberately to ensure that the coast guard is prepared to effectively execute and efficiently support our critical missions in this increasingly im portant region in the future
4891751 this collaboration will assist both countries in defining the con tinental shelf in the arctic ocean it will also save millions of dollars for both countries provide data of great interest to both countries and increase scientific and diplo matic cooperation
4891752 operating ca pabilities of small boats heli copters fixed wing aircraft and their requisite command and con trol are limited by the unpre dictable rapidly changing and often harsh weather including drifting ice and frequently re duced visibility of the arctic envi ronment we also have a greater awareness and sensitivity to the logistical challenges in terms of limited infrastructure and the fi nite availability of lodging and food services
4891753 hamas is trying through this so called legal proceeding to legitimize its human rights violations and assaults on the freedom of expression

4891772 a large number of e mails were received from readers objecting that obama was not the messiah but rather the biblical antichrist prefigured in saint johns apocalypse
4891773 i had to read it about six times before i began to figure it out
4891774 why obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography

4891791 usd jpys rebound from 102 58 extends further in us session and break of 104 10 resistance firstly indicates that fall from 150 70 has completed after drawing support from the short term rising channel

4891795 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
4891796 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
4891797 a consultation period will begin with interested parties and the plan is to start up again within six to eight months
4891798 during that period we will search high and wide for either a homegrown executive or someone with international exposure to get the right individual to become director not chief executive of the relaunched connect
4891799 we will also devise a powerful portfolio of services for the technology sector
4891800 the market has changed and therefore connect scotland must change too go group knows that we must develop this asset in order to provide lasting support
4891801 potent synergy that will flourish both in scotland and beyond
4891802 i know that together through the connect uk network we can offer a strong and varied programme of support for high growth businesses seeking investment
4891803 we intend to fight for it in the senate the liberal party appears to be siding with big oil who dont want consumers to know where they can get the cheapest petrol in any price cycle
4891804 well we do so were going to get up there and fight for this measure
4891805 we are delighted to bring grey gardens from east hampton to broadway to independent lens

4891811 so why are you guys interested in talking to me im no peter drucker im just a cartoonist
4891812 because we like your very atypical point of view we think it could perhaps be useful to us
4891813 well im finding it pretty darn interesting so far but at the end of the day if michael dell doesnt grok it theres not much i can do from what my gut tells me it seems like its very much his company even more so than bill gates and microsoft i could be wrong but still of course if he does end up grokking it then itll get pretty intense pretty quickly in a good way
4891814 happy hearts and happy faces happy play in grassy places that was how in ancient ages children grew to kings and sages
4891815 i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
4891816 i am waiting for you vizzini you told me to go back to the beginning so i have this is where i am and this is where ill stay i will not be moved
4891817 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
4891818 follow your heart but be quiet for a while first ask questions then feel the answer learn to trust your heart
4891819 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
4891820 ive gone through a lot of things and i have the support of my teammates it feels good to be back out on the field around the guys
4891821 he feels better looks better in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of sense of relief when youre talking to him well just take it day by day and see how he does
4891822 ive been running very hard and have used some of my emotions and aggressions in my workouts
4891823 im feeling pretty strong i just want to keep reassuring myself that i have the means and the mind set to keep the weight off
4891824 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong and hes worked out just about every day since hes been back here
4891825 a few weeks ago was the first time i ever opened up to anybody about anything
4891826 its been tough im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
4891827 i wanted to let them know that i hope they still respect me and if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain their respect back
4891828 thats the good thing about the organization they do a great job of getting good character guys here and i feel back at home

4891836 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4891837 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4891838 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4891839 when pixar started there was no cg industry so we were in manufacturing
4891840 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
4891841 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
4891842 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
4891843 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
4891844 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
4891845 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
4891846 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
4891847 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
4891848 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
4891849 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
4891850 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
4891851 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
4891852 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
4891853 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
4891854 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
4891855 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
4891856 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
4891857 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
4891858 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
4891859 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
4891860 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
4891861 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
4891862 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
4891863 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
4891864 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
4891865 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
4891866 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
4891867 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
4891868 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
4891869 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
4891870 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
4891871 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
4891872 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
4891873 no man who worships education has got the best out of education without a gentle contempt for education no mans education is complete
4891874 i thought we had a good day all things considered
4891875 it was a tough road environment and everybody played so we saw a lot of different things
4891876 would really appreciate if you would send me an email sometime
4891877 a healthy body is the guest chamber of the soul a sick its prison
4891878 adornment is never anything except a reflection of the heart
4891879 necklace i knew that i must purchase it immediately but instead they let me know that it was out of stock and would be back in stock a few weeks from then
4891880 surely you must understand that a man with two such ideas cant go on living
4891881 can it be that no one after making an end of god and believing in his own will will dare to express his self will on the most vital point
4891882 how shall we comfort ourselves the murderers of all murderers what was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us what water is there for us to clean ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it there has never been a greater deed and whoever is born after us for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto
4891883 what after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of god

4891887 oh uh there wont be any money but when you die on your deathbed you will receive total consciousness
4891888 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
4891889 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals
4891890 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
4891891 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
4891892 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him
4891893 im not sure if they are going to go through
4891894 if the iraqi government decides it wants international oil companies to partner with them in developing their resources exxon mobil would be interested in participating
4891895 a very nasty period is soon to be upon us be prepared
4891896 i do not think i can be much blunter if you have to be in credit focus on quality short durations non cyclical defensive names
4891897 cash is the key safe haven this is about not losing your money and not losing your job
4891898 globalisation was always going to risk putting g7 bankers into a dangerous corner at some point we have got to that point
4891899 the ugly spoiler is that we may need to see much lower global growth in order to get lower inflation
4891900 the fed is in panic mode the massive credibility chasms down which the fed and maybe even the ecb will plummet when they fail to hike rates in the face of higher inflation will combine to give us a big sell off in risky assets
4891901 economic weakness is spreading and the latest data on consumer demand and confidence are dire the ecb is hell bent on raising rates
4891902 the political fall out could be substantial as finance ministers from the weaker economies rail at the ecb wider spreads between the german bunds and peripheral markets seem assured
4891903 obamas extensive connections with islam and radical politics from his fathers and stepfathers islamic background to his communist and socialist mentors in hawaii and chicago to his long term close associations with former weather underground heroes william ayers and bernadine dohrn associations much closer than heretofore revealed by the press
4891904 barack and michelles twenty year long religious affiliation with the black liberation theology of former trinity united church of christ reverend jeremiah wright whose sermons have always been steeped in a rage first expressed by frantz fanon stokely carmichael and malcolm x a rage that corsi shows has deep meaning for obama
4891905 obamas continuing connections with kenya the homeland of his father through his support for the candidacy of raila odinga the radical socialist presidential contenhder who came to power amid islamist violence and and church burnings
4891906 obamas involvement in the slum lord empire of the chicago political fixer tony rezko who helped bankroll obamas initial campaigns and to purchase barack and michelles dream home property
4891907 obamas far left domestic policy his controversial votes ion his history of opposition to the second amendment gun ownership rights his determination to raise capital gains taxes his impractical plan to achieve universal health care and his radical plan to tax americans to fund a global poverty reducation program
4891908 obamas naive antiwar antinuclear foreign policy predicated on the reduction of the military eradication of nuclear weapons and an overconfidence in the power of his personality as if belief in change alone could somehow transform international politics achieve nuclear weapons disarmament and withdrawal from iraq without adverse consequences for us for the iraqis and for israel
4891909 quem nunca teve n o sabe o que perd lo
4891910 were locked in this shopping mall with all the goodies to ourselves lets go bananas
4891911 hopefully i can become the series second two race winner tomorrow
4891912 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4891913 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
4891914 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
4891915 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
4891916 russia wants international recognition and respect we must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt
4891917 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4891918 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
4891919 were going to heavily invest on the defensive side of the ball
4891920 im not saying offense isnt important because it is ive just always felt that to be a really really good football team you better be outstanding on defense i think our best teams at the academy thats been the case
4891921 i think weve also had some pretty good offenses around here but when weve won championships around here weve had really good defenses
4891922 the 85 group the 98 group those were some defenses that were top 20 defenses
4891923 in 1998 it was the same way there were a lot of low scoring games
4891924 in 97 we won 10 games same way i just think thats where weve got to get
4891925 i think there are only six schools out of the 120 in the football bowl subdivision that have five full time assistants dedicated to the defensive side of the ball
4891926 i just think theres more true instruction and teaching that goes on
4891927 we just cant run an offense thats so out there that our defense never develops
4891928 there are so many of us girls on the streets these days
4891929 with time well start feeling the impact of this conflict on hiv and aids
4891930 there is already great fear that the gains made to reduce the prevalence of hiv in kenya would be lost
4891931 i know its a risky business at times i have gone to the hospital with injuries and venereal diseases but i have no other options
4891932 i have been shopping for them so they no longer ask me where i get the money from
4891933 i was reluctant but nyambura convinced me that the men would pay us
4891934 i had never even had alcohol before but i was desperate for money so i followed my friend
4891935 now that im on the streets on good days i get up to 2 000 kenya shilling 40 after sleeping with five or six men
4891936 sleeping with these men is terrible and sometimes they are rough and hurt me but with time i have gotten used to it
4891937 people have no income children have been displaced and they want to help supplement their parents income if there is no food to eat and theyre responsible for their siblings they go out and make money for food
4891938 this prostitution will definitely lead to an increase in the spread of aids and many parents will lose their children
4891939 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4891940 faith in god is not some random blind leap of faith it is belief in something we cannot see yet which can be trusted on the basis of reasonable reasoned through thought out evidence
4891941 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4891942 what did you do today to find a job what are you doing tomorrow to find a job how many places have you applied to
4891943 we ran our two minute offense the entire game in stephenville
4891944 ive gotten so accustomed to calling the no huddle hurry up spread offense it would seem slow and mundane to call any other style
4891945 on the flip side it might have been the best thing for my career
4891946 i remember running play after play after play in the first practice after i got home i went to bed and slept half the day
4891947 in our offense last year we might have five seconds left on the clock when wed run a play
4891948 this year we probably wont even use five seconds before we run the next play
4891949 anything less than another state title would be a disappointment
4891950 queremos que todos conozcan nuestra tristeza nuestra incertidumbre nuestra inestabilidad generada por el desorden administrativo que se vive en la instituci n
4891951 hab amos quedado en que con la plata del cl sico nos iban a pagar pero sale el se or rodrigo delgado a decir que no alcanz la plata porque hubo que pagar impuestos y todas esas cosas
4891952 merezco el respeto de parte de los jugadores en este caso del se or jersson gonz les voy a hablar personalmente con l y sto lo voy a llevar al comit ejecutivo al comit disciplinario porque esto no puede pasar por alto menos en la situaci n en la que est la corporaci n el otro punto es que estamos cansados del tema del se or juan miguel rodr guez mientras ellos estaban diciendo eso yo estuve gestionando el pago de la quincena logr conseguir unos recursos y esas son las cosas que los jugadores no ven la taquilla est clara el informe est claro lamentablemente estamos detectando algunas cosas que nosotros tenemos que manejar es el tema de la boleter a especialmente la boleter a de invitaci n vamos a tener un control absoluto y total de la boleter a para el pr ximo partido vamos a cambiar hasta el sitio en donde estabamos haciendo la boleter a vamos a mirar a ver si detectamos fallas en la log stica
4891953 por ejemplo entraron 12534 personas con boleta pero de las cuales 3714 fueron boletas de invitaci n lo que quiere decir que al final fueron realmente 8820 personas que dejaron un recaudo de 105000

4891956 a heavy metal journey into an urban hell where everything was done wrong
4891957 my brothers used to beat me and no one liked me
4891958 we went through the trouble of evacuating and nothing happened here
4891959 i know it was for our safety but its frustrating
4891960 we didnt think of evacuating when we heard about this last storm
4891961 after what happened with rita we just stayed and got prepared for the storm
4891962 i dont think were going to evacuate again unless its at least a category 3
4891963 its a real serious concern for me that people are saying this because its such a dangerous situation to be in
4891964 experts say for every six evacuations youll probably only have one true disaster i understand their concerns about practicing and practicing evacuations but at what price do you risk the safety of your family
4891965 there were so many cars out there the traffic was just really bad
4891966 it was a three hour drive to get there and on the way back it took almost 16 hours to get home
4891967 cars were broken down people who had houses along the highway were offering drinks to people it was just a really long drive
4891968 a lot of people wasted a lot of money and gas on that
4891969 i hated that i spent all that money to go up there but they all thought we were in danger
4891970 i was happy when i got back and saw nothing happened though i had just bought new furniture and a new tv so i was going to be mad if all that was gone
4891971 until were told we have to leave its nice to stay and watch your property
4891972 we had a plan that wouldnt work and we realized that after the fact
4891973 instead of being jammed in traffic now you can go whichever way you want
4891974 we recommend you choose a couple of routes because you never know when the one you first chose will be congested
4891975 people would be sitting around while a storm was coming not knowing if theyre zone a zone b and so on but everyone knows their zip code
4891976 we start with the surfside and quintana zip codes and go inland
4891977 kemungkinan kecelakaan kita fokuskan pada kelalaian manusia karena sarana yang lain dalam keadaaan baik
4891978 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4891979 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4891980 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4891981 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4891982 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4891983 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4891984 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4891985 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4891986 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company
4891987 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4891988 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4891989 es w re haarklauberei nach verbesserungsm glichkeiten zu suchen dieser sieg gibt uns r ckenwind und selbstvertrauen ich bin vor allem mit der spielweise meiner mannschaft zufrieden
4891990 die jungs waren so motiviert und hei auf die bundesliga da war es f r uns ein leichtes gegen die nervosit t anzugehen
4891991 wir sind wahrscheinlich erster weil hoffenheim mit h beginnt und schalke mit s ich schaue erst nach zehn spieltagen auf die tabelle
4891992 dass ich das erste bundesliga tor f r hoffenheim gemacht habe ist eine sch ne geschichte aber das wichtigste ist dass die mannschaft gewonnen hat
4891993 das passiert im fu ball immer wieder mal dass bei einem zweikampf die arme zu hoch sind ich unterstelle ihm da keine absicht
4891994 wir haben schwach gespielt ohne kampf ohne aggressivit t und ohne bewegung
4891995 wir sind berhaupt nicht in die zweik mpfe gekommen und hoffenheim hat seine chance eiskalt genutzt
4891996 wir sind zu berheblich und arrogant ins spiel gegangen unser auftritt muss uns jetzt nachdenklich machen denn uns erwartet schon am freitag wieder ein schweres spiel
4891997 dieses spiel gibt viel selbstvertrauen aber wir m ssen dieses niveau jetzt jede woche abrufen
4891998 he was an amazing pioneer in so many ways he cut out a huge piece of territory he definitely managed to alienate people while he was alive because of his commercialism and his interest in celebrity hed paint the shah of iran hed paint anyone for money the feeling was that there was a corruption there but he raises questions we are still dealing with now not least how the mass media have changed the rules of the world

4892005 we intend to fight for it in the senate the liberal party appears to be siding with big oil who dont want consumers to know where they can get the cheapest petrol in any price cycle
4892006 well we do so were going to get up there and fight for this measure
4892007 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4892008 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4892009 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4892010 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4892011 the sample had greater trust in private compared with public hospitals but greater trust in public medicare than private health insurers systems
4892012 this may reflect australians historical support for a public health care system combined with an awareness of the long waiting lists and strained resources currently experienced by australias public hospitals
4892013 this national survey confirmed that public trust in australian health care is quite robust
4892014 the art work titled complex shit is the size of a house
4892015 since the 1990s a large reptilian creature has been sighted occasionally on umbungi island in west new britain papua new guinea the creature was described as having a long tail and a long neck and was 10 15 metres in length with an appearance like a very large wallaby and having a head like a turtles head
4892016 this album is so depressing that it is actually about to make me break down and start crying this is not a band to turn to when you feel bad im not sure exactly how they do it but the tones they choose and the slow methodical way they present them somehow set up a mood of unending gloom and pain life is never going to get any better i am going to feel like this until the day i die i dont want to but i cant stop i try everything they tell me to do and nothing works i dont deserve to be alive i am wasting a perfect life im blowing it i know i will lose it all soon i cant keep it together anymore its too much if you dont feel it i cant explain it i see no possible end to the psychological emotional mental torture that my brain puts me through every second of every day i would be better off dead and everybody who knows me especially those closest to me would be better off if i was dead i hate myself so much it astonishes me that anybody bothers to like me i am a worthless piece of shit i cant even tell the difference between fatigue and depression anymore am i depressed because im tired or tired because im depressed and why am i anxious 24 hours a day as you may be able to tell this is the absolute finest example of the swans ability to take a shaky mood and completely smash it into pieces there is no light on this recording and it is a long double album recording goes back and forth between studio and live pieces recorded between 81 and 85 with each track more punishing and cruel than the last this is the sound of ultimate despair nobody ive heard has recreated it this convincingly not even neurosis this is the one for gods sake dont buy this album it is perfect swans

4892026 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4892027 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
4892028 you could have put ideas out there faced so much headwind and resistance and had people sort of give up
4892029 high school students used to say that they didnt have to worry too much about their academic preparation because theyd say i can always get into the u
4892030 i think that shows when he goes out and talks to constituents the legislature the faculty
4892031 you cant deny his commitment and his vision for the university
4892032 you could have put ideas out there faced so much headwind and resistance and had people sort of give up
4892033 hell be like a dog on a bone hell just keep working it and working it
4892034 i put out a lot of feelers and tried to find out who was the most effective dean on campus someone who can make hard decisions and retain the confidence of the faculty and alumni
4892035 not only knew where the bodies were buried he helped bury a few
4892036 i tackled some issues but there were some sacred cows i didnt want to go after
4892037 i was more stubborn and argumentative than im normally inclined to be
4892038 when i used that word publicly that so resonated with people
4892039 to criticize your university is a pretty harsh thing to do
4892040 some of us were a little concerned with the amount of money the university spent fighting the central corridor route thats the type of thing that if youre a legislator and youre concerned about high tuition it obviously catches your attention
4892041 i would put financing the future of the university as one of the two or three biggest challenges we face
4892042 wed be extremely fortunate to be one of the best schools in the big ten
4892043 continuing on with this orwellian third best public research university in the world business in light of reality is an embarrassment and only serves to make us look naive and foolish
4892044 we know how hard it is to compete against the other top universities
4892045 we know its a very challenging economic time for the state and the university its hard to do everything we need to do to be top three i think thats where the frustration ends up coming out
4892046 if i do serve that full three or even two of that three ill be the second longest serving president in the last 35 40 years at the university of minnesota
4892047 we want to implement the biomedical science program to continue the private fundraising for the stadium
4892048 could a rapid drop in per capita meat demand in developed countries also help reduce malnutriton
4892049 reduced demand for meat in developed countries would affect food consumption in developing countries primarily through prices reduced demand for meat will directly reduce the world price for meat making meat more affordable for customers in developed countries this reduced meat demand and drop in meat prices will also cause a direct reduction in meat production in both developed and developing countries which will reduce the demand for cereals for animal feed reduced demand for feedgrains will in turn cause a drop in prices of cereals including an increase in food demand for cereals
4892050 1 even though 3 6 million lives out of a projected 129 million undernourished children is only 2 8 percent of the total it is in itself a good enough reason to justify the reduction 2 why restrict the calculation only to children roughly 1 2 billion people live in absolute poverty so the same 2 8 percent would relieve 33 6 million people in total 3 decreases in meat eating in excess of 50 would save even more lives
4892051 you need to eat something you look fucking annorexic im not trying to be mean but im concerned for your health

4892063 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4892064 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4892065 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4892066 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee

4892076 our cancer rates are going up because the population is getting older but as more australians put on more weight it is going up even quicker
4892077 we need to recognise this now and act on it with tough measures to try to turn this around
4892078 we really dont know what works for obesity so we can borrow from tobacco because that was hugely successful
4892079 there is pretty much no limit to the type of food which is being advertised
4892080 accustom yourself to unreasonableness and injustice abide in peace in the presence of god who sees all these evils more clearly than you do and who permits them be content with doing with calmness the little which depends upon yourself and let all else be to you as if it were not

4892131 we were all ready to go donald wilson murray international holdings chief executive had negotiated it for months with complete confidentiality
4892132 everything was pretty much agreed and then i said look gentlemen before we do this can you tell me how youre going to run this club
4892133 im sitting there with all the legal documents in front of me and they outline their plans well carve this up well sell that off and after a while i said enough were not doing the deal we got up and walked out we took our papers and went out of the door it wasnt for rangers in my opinion they did not want to take the club forward in a football way
4892134 thats the closest ive come to selling a few hours last year in a nice london hotel

4892146 should be avoided at all costs because they imply the inviolability of the hypervisor at any level from the virtual networking to the kernel something that nor vmware neither any other virtualization vendor can grant
4892147 nbsp in a way i think i understand exactly where alessandro is coming from even if i dont completely agree with him or at least i partially do
4892148 yeah but these are basically the same views someone might get looking at a firewall ids or ips tool today
4892149 you might argue nbsp thats right except we already know that server and virtualization administrators as well as most network folk dont have access to those tools
4892150 i know this conversation is supposed to be about rainbows and unicorns but the internet is horribly horribly broken
4892151 inevitable that network security will eventually be subsumed into the network fabric

4892196 ssee in preseason way to serious it means nothing for the season if it did then the colts should forget about the season because they are 0 2 right now and the patriots lost already too so they must suck the preseason doesnt mean much other than whos on the 52 man roster and who gets put on the practice squad
4892197 alright i see where this is going all season long its going to be one side making every excuse for rodgers and management and one side flaming on everything that doesnt go right insisting that everybody get cut or fired thats why i dont read or post on packer bulletin boards much hardly anyone has a balanced realistic view i miss cliff cristl telling people when they were being idiots
4892198 there were some feelings i have not felt in a while but i was excited
4892199 we had keller and franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 and franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple

4892205 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4892206 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4892207 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4892208 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4892209 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4892210 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4892211 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4892216 it started out as a bit of a project for myself because i am interested in old systems but i soon thought he deserved more attention than this
4892217 on april 24 1995 a 55 ton boulder suddenly rolled 400 feet down a cliff along the mississippi river and plowed into the 2 bedroom house of maxine and dwight anderson when the dust settled the andersons found a huge coin shaped rock where their master bedroom used to be the rock is still there today john burt a local real estate investor bought the house with the rock still firmly wedged inside it and turned it into a tourist attraction the rock in the house
4892218 honey lets stop and see the rock in the house

4892225 we have these new tracks we have better nutrition we have better coaching techniques
4892226 when i ran for instance or when other jamaicans ran we didnt know so much about biomechanics and these kinds of things
4892227 im happy with the fact being part of this charity program we get to learn new things every day
4892228 i will never regret this opportunity being here is great ive learnt a lot about how people suffer the common diseases that affect the people of fiji and also the measures we should take to prevent ourselves from being infected
4892229 i really like being here and ive been challenged the sick needs our support and the only way we can show them that we care is to visit them
4892230 six steps to financial freedom 3 10 its unity time again now in chicago im talking about emotional intelligence the ability to be self aware self managing socially aware and adept at managing relationships 6 q amp a with butch ward poynter institute this sounds simple but bosses got pro
4892231 the first opportunity the country had to make the multi party government work in 1999 fiji labour party leader mahendra chaudhry turned it down
4892232 in 2001 prime minister laisenia qarase returned the favour and equally refused to make the multi party government work
4892233 in 2006 however qarase offered very many portfolios to the flp which they needed to accept but chaudhry stayed out
4892234 and why because a few months later he totally destroyed peaceful racial co operation in the country by supporting the 2006 military coup
4892235 you hop on a plane and you get here in 12 hours
4892236 every game every run every pitch theres so much lying on it
4892237 to see the cubans where else are you going to go
4892238 to see korea this is the place to go to see their best players same with taiwan its a matter of seeing all the better players in the world in one venue
4892239 you never know when any talent is going to be available so you have to constantly keep in check
4892240 its a couple of things one you look to try to see if theres somebody you can sign now and two for the future
4892241 some clubs will have no players some will have eight or 10 and some will be available and some wont be available
4892242 if you went to japan it might take you a month to see all those guys
4892243 but were not skipping anybody you just never know sometimes guys at a young age throw 85 86 mph and three or four years later you see them again and theyre throwing in the lows 90s
4892244 bottom line you have to be really good in the dominican and venezuela
4892245 but its also always good to have other resources to cover other ground
4892246 we were shocked we applied at places like mcdonalds burger king and jack in the box we went to shoe stores pizza parlors and convenience stores the workers were overwhelmingly spanish speaking pretty much they always ask us do you speak spanish they said we prefer bilingual
4892247 its hard when you cant even get an interview because you dont speak spanish
4892248 its like three strikes black young and non spanish speaking im mad but there is nothing i can do about it its not fair
4892249 dame dos hamburgesas con queso un big mac dos papitas fritas y tres sodas
4892250 give me two cheeseburgers one big mac two fries three cokes
4892251 thats what were up against its a form of discrimination
4892252 mcdonalds is committed to recognizing the talents and job performance of all employees and values the contributions that come from people with different backgrounds and perspectives we believe in developing and maintaining a diverse workforce that will strengthen the mcdonalds system
4892253 i dont think its discrimination its more about catering to the customers who come through the door
4892254 of course you dont have to learn to speak spanish to get a job in a fast food restaurant but in certain parts of the country like san bernardino where youve got the impact of immigration it certainly limits your chances of getting the job you want
4892255 you better believe black teens looking for summer jobs are feeling the impact of immigration
4892256 its a very stressful and difficult dilemma sometimes you feel like youre straddling two nations on one hand you strive for diversity on the other you are forced to hire people who are best equipped to serve your core customer base sometimes that boils down to bilingual preferred
4892257 the job chill is not limited to the fast food industry
4892258 in most cases i was asked do you speak spanish we are being pushed out of minimum wage jobs on every front employers are under intense pressure to capture every dollar that comes in the door customers want cheap fast hassle free everything what happens to black inner city kids whether they get summer jobs or not is not on their radar
4892259 when we look in the want ads for jobs we qualify for they say bilingual bilingual bilingual preferred

4892264 when americans import medicines illegally or buy medicines online from unreliable sources they are faced with a dangerous buyer beware situation
4892265 the fda understands why people who are having a hard time paying for prescription drugs might do this we have been expanding our generic drug program to help make more affordable prescription drugs available this is one solution that does not put consumers at risk
4892266 the fda also encourages consumers to learn about potential savings through medicares outpatient prescription drug coverage
4892267 this new program comes at a time when five out of six people aged 65 and older are taking at least one medication and almost half of all elderly people take three or more
4892268 the mma also gives medicare the ability to provide additional comprehensive help to those in greatest need beneficiaries with very high prescription drug costs and people with low incomes
4892269 many see generics as the only way they can afford prescription drugs
4892270 still there are some people who doubt generics because they think that anything that costs more must be better but the reason generic manufacturers can sell the drugs less expensively is not because the quality is lower its because there is competition among these generic manufacturers who dont have to repeat the expensive safety and effectiveness testing that brand companies have already conducted
4892271 patients should ask if there is a generic in the class of drugs they are taking
4892272 tiered co payment structures through insurance plans encourage the use of generics
4892273 for example there might be a copay of seven dollars for generics and 14 dollars for brand drugs
4892274 choosing generics saves your employer money and that makes it more likely the employer will continue offering coverage and if you dont have health insurance and youre paying out of pocket generics will bring you big savings
4892275 i think most physicians would want to help if they knew a patient wont be able to follow the treatment
4892276 but many patients find it a hard subject to bring up
4892277 are you going to have any trouble getting this medication
4892278 we dont advocate splitting pills to save money and this isnt something patients should do on their own
4892279 we leave it up to the doctors if the prescriber thinks a patient could benefit from a lower dose of medication than is available or if its the only way a patient can afford the treatment then the doctor can direct that a patient split the tablet pharmacies sell inexpensive devices that help consumers easily split tablets of all shapes
4892280 the intended use of a free sample is to allow a patient to evaluate side effects and effectiveness for a couple of weeks before actually buying the drug
4892281 so patients can ask for free samples but know that they are a temporary fix
4892282 there was no generic alternative so the doctor gave her some free samples
4892283 but patients have to consider how long the physician can provide the free samples and what to do when they run out
4892284 if you do take free samples you should still let your pharmacist know so that we can stay on top of drug interactions
4892285 they arent intended for maintenance giving them out puts doctors in the position of having to act like a pharmacist because youre supposed to keep up with lot numbers and expiration dates in case there are recalls youre also getting patients started on a more expensive drug
4892286 its important to know that a lot of people will never reach the 2 250 amount
4892287 none of this applies to the medicare beneficiaries who qualify for extra help because they will have no premiums no deductibles and no gaps in coverage
4892288 beneficiaries should be hearing from their former employer or union this fall about their coverage options
4892289 if they havent chosen a plan before january these dual eligibles will be automatically enrolled in a prescription drug plan so that no gap in coverage occurs
4892290 but they will also have the ability to change plans once a month if they find a plan that better suits their needs
4892291 we have about 50 000 people in oregon who fall into this category
4892292 the automatic enrollment is good because we dont want people to fall through the cracks at the same time we will be letting people know they need to review the plan theyve been assigned to see if it meets their needs and we will be giving them assistance to help them make needed changes
4892293 we have brought in approximately 90 million dollars in free and low cost medications in the three years we have been in operation
4892294 about 80 percent of our current clients will be eligible for the low income subsidy with medicare part d
4892295 we have been working over the last several months to ensure that our clients who are eligible for medicare savings programs are enrolled we are also conducting many education opportunities about the changes in medicare and providing one on one counseling for our clients and their families and physicians
4892296 the card is not valid once you sign up for a plan
4892297 this will show people what plans are available on a local level
4892298 we do sometimes make exceptions for patients whose incomes exceed these amounts in special circumstances like if they are taking a number of medicines
4892299 patients are directed to programs that could be most helpful
4892300 we know that medicines when taken as prescribed improve lives and decrease overall health care spending
4892301 but for people who cant pay for them any price is too high thats why gsk and the pharmaceutical industry support programs that make our programs accessible
4892302 we have found that hospital and emergency admissions have decreased for most patients in the program
4892303 thats because the patients are taking the medications they need and they arent as stressed about how they will pay for them
4892304 i start by finding out which company makes the particular medication then i get the forms and work with patients to fill them out
4892305 it takes about four to eight weeks to hear back about whether the patient is accepted
4892306 at first many of the patients who come to see me say they dont want the medication because they cant afford it so i help them realize what their options are
4892307 a prescription doesnt do the patients any good if they cant get the medicine
4892308 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4892309 it was a great scrimmage and we accomplished what we wanted to
4892310 we won the game we found three or four things we need to do better and we got a lot of people minutes that we needed to see
4892311 for us it was mission accomplished a lot of things we wanted to see tonight we did
4892312 melinda was very solid in the back and played the whole game
4892313 kyndall scored a great goal and almost had two shes just full of energy shes a great player and i thought she was fantastic
4892314 and we also had several other freshmen who got in and were solid who we feel like can contribute this year were happy with the group
4892315 were monitoring the storm the airline is aware of the situation and worst case scenario well evacuate
4892316 well wait for word from major league baseball and the local authorities we can get a plane in an hours notice
4892317 it sounds like were not going to be working on our suntans down there
4892318 we came up on cone and met his second asking price and he still turned us down when youre dealing with 18 year old kids sometimes that happens
4892319 usually there comes a time where you get some guys some playing time sean got a lot of playing time at second base earlier this year theres no doubt about the way he handles himself on the field and that will translate to shortstop too
4892320 a young player sure there are probably some things hes going to have to do to show that hes ready but were not there right now were at a point where we want to win games erick has been playing well and thats what were going with
4892321 the volunteers when theyre on their own they do pay for taking the little friend out but when we do a fun function as a group the program pays for it and so its a good way for different matches to see different people and see them in different settings
4892322 the campaign by the union movement continues to run to ensure that we remind the electorate that we are still a long way from restoring fairness and balance to australias workplaces
4892323 many people out there think it amp squo s gone it amp squo s not
4892324 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4892325 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4892326 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4892327 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4892328 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4892329 come to think of it it is indeed the most wonderful and unique bridge in the world

4892340 in every income group blacks are less likely than whites to surpass their parents family income and more likely to fall down the economic ladder
4892341 only 31 percent of black children born to middle income parents make more than their parents family income compared to 68 of white children
4892342 almost half 45 of black children whose parents were solidly middle income end up falling to the bottom of the income distribution compared to only 16 of white children
4892343 forty seven percent of daughters born to parents on the bottom rung stay on the bottom rung compared to 35 of sons

4892347 as far as the players go there has been some concern there is no doubt about that there has been concern for quite a while now
4892348 we as a cricket team are no different to any other australian i am sure everyday australians that you would bump into in the street would have some concerns as well but the good thing is we are a lot more informed now than we were before the day started
4892349 it was a disgrace it showed a complete lack of understanding and respect for the concerns we have
4892350 we are pleased the task force came and saw us but they have done nothing to allay fears that pakistan is a dangerous place to tour
4892351 we are in the same position we the nzcpa cannot recommend touring pakistan even if cricketers were not the targets pakistan is a country in turmoil we have seen the taliban increase their activity recently with a number of bombings in different cities theres a real possibility our players could be caught in a terrorist bombing and become collateral damage

4892354 in the labs we have seen evidence of attacks that are typical of so called cyber warfare attacks
4892355 certainly ddos attacks and defacements are not new and have been used by those with malicious intent during events such as public riots or events of a political nature
4892356 websites of the government in estonia were targeted by a reported ddos attack and in 2008 a website belonging to the tibetan government was injected with malicious source code

4892362 its important when something like this happens that people of all faiths good people come together and say we wont tolerate this
4892363 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4892364 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4892365 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4892366 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee
4892367 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way

4892390 after that i dont remember anything for about four days
4892391 we thought about going back there but to redo our house it wouldnt have made sense
4892392 it was a fine starter house for someone to walk around but for someone in a wheelchair it was just not designed for it
4892393 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word

4892402 our staff was highly motivated to find someone to give that scholarship to which is hard to do in april and may we worked hard to convince maurice that vermont is the best place for him so we were overjoyed when he decided to join us
4892403 we struggled a lot for the ground we fought against all odds and forces to acquire the maidan we hoisted a flag on the ground for the first time this republic day and thought we should continue with the practice
4892404 the pride and freedom that we feel when the flag flutters high on that ground is simply great henceforth we will always hoist a flag on this ground it has its own sweetness
4892405 in 1994 we wrote a routine letter to the bmc asking for permission to hold our annual sports day on the gandhi nagar ground we were denied permission we were told that the ground did not belong to the public any longer as it had been taken over by mig club
4892406 our children use the ground every day and the matches on sundays have stopped as well we feel that our ground has come back to us
4892407 yeah but i thought wed go back to that one beach we stopped at on the way to

4892451 to me bernie was more than a tv uncle he was a mentor and someone i truly looked up to he was the embodiment of kindness professionalism and generosity
4892452 he went from 103rd street and martin luther king drive to beverly hills from the wheel of a wonder bread truck to a world of wonder he had plans to do one more tour but somebody must have told god that he was good
4892453 one of the hardest things for a black man is to be an individual bernie mac was a man he stood alone
4892454 bernie said he always walked alone weve heard it a thousand times but i dont think he walked alone he walked with jesus
4892455 the term is generally applied to behavior within civil governments but politics has been observed in all human group interactions including corporate academic and religious institutions
4892456 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4892457 this system is just too clumsy and insecure for your protection a centralized database has been established to make your private information more secure
4892458 the legislation that created the department of homeland security was very specific on the question of a national id card they said there will be no national id card
4892459 the goal of the real id act is straightforward it seeks to prevent another 9 11 type attack by disrupting terrorist travel
4892460 all the 9 11 terrorists had photo ids some of the ids were real some were fake some were real ids in fake names bought from a crooked dmv employee in for 1 000 each
4892461 harder to forge ids only help marginally because the problem is not making sure the id is valid
4892462 honest person who wont try to hijack or blow up anything
4892463 the message is this congress has no money the national debt is over 9 trillion the only way congress could pay for real id would be if they borrowed the money to do so another 11 billion plus would need to be borrowed borrowing is done using the treasury department issuing 30 year t bills and other certificates of debt that are paid off down the road by more borrowing therefore for congress to pay for real id they would need to literally send the bill to our grandchildren to enslave this generation
4892464 shall verify with the issuing agency the issuance validity and completeness of each document required to be presented
4892465 such a database would be a kludge of existing databases databases that are incompatible full of erroneous data and unreliable as computer scientists we do not know how to keep a database of this magnitude secure whether from outside hackers or the thousands of insiders authorized to access it
4892466 that will predictably cause problems for persons who may fear for their personal safety including judges police officers or domestic violence victims or persons who simply may not have a permanent home such as the homeless who may be urgently in need or medicare or other benefits there needs to be a procedure to ensure these persons safety and welfare currently the real id act has none

4892487 the longer the rallies went the worse i felt i felt like i didnt have any coordination whatever they gave me really helped
4892488 hes been a bit nought out of three lately so weve been doing a bit of work with him on his finishing and hopefully that will be good for his confidence
4892489 we kicked 13 so there wasnt a whole lot of scoring going on and that was an important contribution
4892490 to keep buddy franklin to seven scoring shots is a bit of a heroic effort to be honest usually its about 12
4892491 but the murphy matchup was always going to be a difficult one for us
4892492 i thought our defensive group was pretty solid and joel in particular he was sent out to play on murphy the rest of the defenders defended who was there and it was good that he actually ran forward too and had a shot at goal
4892493 theres a few things we need to address internally and theres a few players we need to get back into form
4892494 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4892495 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4892496 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4892497 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee
4892498 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way

4892508 hay un acuerdo entre calder n hinojosa y romero deschamps para mantener la corrupci n en el organismo sindical a cambio de que apoye la reforma calderonista
4892509 no permitiremos que entreguen la industria petrolera porque el petr leo es garant a para sacar adelante a m xico

4892513 los que se alan a sat n lo revelan los que luchan contra sat n le dan poder los que insultan a sat n le dan influencia los que hablan mucho de sat n lo crean pero aquellos que veneran a sat n lo dominan aquellos que pasivamente lo resisten ganan su respeto aquellos que lo aceptan reducen su influencia y aquellos que lo analizan aprenden de su sabidur a
4892514 pero hermanos este morderse las u as acerca de la causa de la maldad es lo que me da verdadera risa no les preocupa saber cu l es la causa de la bondad y entonces por qu quieren averiguar el otro asunto
4892515 el mal no es un principio moral sino de desequilibrio y v rtigo un principio de complejidad y extra eza de seducci n de irreductibilidad no es un principio de muerte al contrario es un principio de vital desenlace
4892516 pensar no es salir de la caverna ni sustituir la incertidumbre de las sombras por los perfiles bien definidos de las cosas mismas el resplandor vacilante de una llama por la luz del verdadero sol pensar es entrar en el laberinto
4892517 theres no avoiding what theres no avoiding this adage came to mind when i read the pronouncement by irans islamic revolutionary guards corps commander mohammad ali jafari who said my country is easily capable of closing the straits of hormuz the main passageway for oil freighters if the country is attacked due to its nuclear program
4892518 in my estimation confronting this country which is trying to gain the time necessary to acquire nuclear weapons is unavoidable
4892519 history has taught us that ideological countries only pay heed to victory over their ideology they never accept any halfway situation even when they find themselves on the brink of disaster
4892520 confrontation is the solution and there is no solution but confrontation the game of the carrot and the stick played by the u s and e u will be to no avail
4892521 at present we are suffering from two things irans attempts to gain regional hegemony and its attempts to impose its influence via its sectarian allies the fifth column of arab shiite fundamentalists
4892522 perhaps it is a strange coincidence that this time around our strategic interests coincide with those of israel the regime of the mullahs in iran is our enemy and at the same time it is an enemy not just of israel but of world peace and security
4892523 i know that the arab demagogues stand together indiscriminately with anyone who is against israel and america
4892524 in politics nothing prevents you from allying with the devil for the sake of your interests this is what confronting the iranian danger which is close demands of us this issue in my estimation cannot suffer delay or hesitation every passing day benefits iran
4892525 oh my god a free mango during a food crisis i must pick it up and run with it
4892526 they both did some good things and yet there were some ball handling parts where i think we just have to be a little more exact in the way that we carry the ball
4892527 it just happens where certain quarterbacks play better on certain days
4892528 when we see that happen well know who the starter is
4892529 id take a bunch more days like this because i think it makes you be better fundamentally
4892530 were going to have a game this year where its snowing sideways
4892531 we always want to be under 1 20 seconds and we had a bunch that were 1 16 1 19 and thats coordination between a snapper and a holder and a kicker
4892532 these will include patients who are on dialysis they can stay in the hotel have their dialysis and use singapore as a base and travel to the surrounding nations
4892533 there is a huge demand for medical space there are so many doctors who cannot get a medical suite to practice if you look at the situation now all the medical suites at rival group parkway there are three or four doctors sharing one suite so theres definitely a need for a new hospital new suites just to make us catch up with neighbouring countries
4892534 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
4892535 hey let me know if there are 10 left over
4892536 ich wollte mich selber stolz machen der jubel war nicht so geplant das war einfach nur freude

4892540 wie ich geh rt habe wird der verband einen cheftrainer einstellen damit es endlich eine einheitliche trainings und wettkampf planung gibt
4892541 ich bin kein ausgebildeter trainer aber ich bin bereit den vorstand des deutschen ruderverbandes mit meinem wissen um diesen sport zu beraten in welcher funktion auch immer

4892546 lo primero nos permite estar recibiendo colaboraciones de todo tipo con el fin de estar en constante evoluci n mientras que ser los ganadores ni con los pa ses que faltan por decidir nos pueden alcanzar nos permite manejar mejores econom as de escala de cara al costo que implica adoptar la nueva tecnolog a
4892547 la principal ventaja de nuestro sistema es que con los mismos transmisores podemos enviar se al a los televisores y a los dispositivos m viles
4892548 los beneficios en salud no pueden ser ilimitados deben tener un punto de partida
4892549 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4892550 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4892551 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4892552 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4892553 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4892554 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything

4892562 you probably wont be able to find this anywhere else at all so just be glad its here and put up with the poor quality
4892563 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4892564 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4892565 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4892566 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4892567 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4892568 im really proud of the guys for building that car that way and doing all the homework they did to make it that good
4892569 weve had more than our share of good fortune here
4892570 its a race track that suits our cars and our driving style theres just an expectation when we come to michigan
4892571 ive had a lot of years here coming to this race track first as a fan and secondarily as a team owner and im honored as ive been many times to be in fast company
4892572 carl is motivated hes able hes skilled hes experienced hes cautious and hes aggressive
4892573 hes all those things but its for nothing if the crew chief doesnt have the presence doesnt have the confidence in himself to make the change for the last run that will win the race
4892574 there were a couple cars that were real fast tony stewart and brian vickers were extremely fast but my pit crew was just great at the end
4892575 it reminded me of what i can imagine daytona was like without restrictor plates and with the slingshot and everything you could get two or three guys there and it really got racy and fun
4892576 i dont think ive ever been a part of anything that was that much fun at michigan
4892577 their moves of expressive and large with touches of understandable arrogance whatever your expectations may be this band will exceed them
4892578 enjoyable to listen to with hugely impressive melodies always present and astronomically catchy choruses attached to all five of these excellent pop songs
4892579 the getaway team is one of the new bright young bands on todays music scene who successfully manage to mix numerous genres together into a unique sound
4892580 throughout this self assured debut there are catchy tunes harmonies which are well harmonious and well written songs
4892581 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4892582 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4892583 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4892584 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4892585 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4892586 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4892587 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4892588 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
4892589 is finishing 12th and winning the league cup a successful season for us i dont think so
4892590 you see the real quality of a team after 38 games in the league cup or the fa cup if you win five games you can be in the final
4892591 if you dont win the league of course you are frustrated but the levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and two or three points is not a big gap we finished with 83 points last season and everywhere else in europe that would have made us champions
4892592 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4892593 i am confident in us we lost only three games last season and we have a stability in our club which means we can keep improving
4892594 i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4892595 i dont want us to be known as little old albion and we are going to strengthen the squad over the remainder of the transfer window
4892596 i hope we can add at least four bodies over the next few weeks because we want more quality out on the pitch
4892597 our attitude was very good but we have earned the right to be here because the championship is a hard hard league now we have to work hard to stay here and we will be competitive in every match we play
4892598 this scroll of the torah shall not depart from you mouth and you shall meditate in it day and night
4892599 if a person plows at the time of plowing sows at the time of sowing winnows when it blows what will become of torah however when jews do the will of hashem their work is done by others when they do not do the will of hashem they not only do not accomplish their own work but do the work of others
4892600 many have followed the words of r shimon bar yochai and did not succeed
4892601 do not come to the academy at harvest and gathering time lest you become impoverished and will have to engage in making a living the rest of the year brochos 35b
4892602 a person like me who has learned the entire torah can i go and study the wisdom of the greeks
4892603 go and find time which is neither day nor night and study greek wisdom then
4892604 this scroll of the torah shall not depart from you mouth and you shall meditate upon it day and night
4892605 even if one reads the shema morning and evening he has fulfilled this verse ibid

4892633 i recommend to all nigerians in the diaspora the time to come back home is now the asians are going back home no one else can fix this country for us we had a choice also we could have left but we stayed back
4892634 it is no excuse to ask us what you would do when you come back home because there was no promise when you left the country
4892635 i recommend to all nigerians in the diaspora the time to come back home is now the asians are going back home no one else can fix this country for us
4892636 to the statement that asians are returning home i must say that i do not have the studies research or facts to counter this

4892663 this year well have to evaluate our competition to see where we are at there were a lot of girls that graduated last year but there are still a lot of good players out there
4892664 i did not play as many tournaments this past summer but i was on the court four times a week
4892665 i did not play in any tournaments this past summer
4892666 but i did get out and hit with my friends this summer
4892667 out of our 15 players on the team six are seniors
4892668 this group works really hard and they are really dedicated
4892669 i think they are watching these two swick and chamberlain and are seeing what it takes to get to the next level
4892670 but i hope he gets back soon hes going to be good for these girls
4892671 because of the experience ive had in the past its hard to close when youre 4 up sometimes
4892672 you start thinking about closing it and then little mistakes happen you let them back in give them some confidence and you start losing holes kind of quickly
4892673 its who makes the putts and who plays well either one of us could win
4892674 those were unbelievable putts i was trying to get feel today i wasnt putting very well
4892675 i didnt want to give up the crown from last year quietly
4892676 at that point youre just trying to get yourself to make a swing it was getting tight
4892677 i just was rattled starting out i pulled both of my drives
4892678 ive learned in match play you wait for the momentum swings
4892679 i think she speaks for a lot of women in the world she isnt fake shes just a real down to earth woman

4892683 then let me show you something that will make you feel young as when the world was new
4892684 it is a far better thing that i do than i have ever done a far better rest i go to than i have ever known
4892685 something spock was trying to tell me on my birthday
4892686 get rid of all bitterness rage and anger brawling and slander along with every form of malice be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in christ god forgave you
4892687 humility is not denying the power or gifting you have but admitting that the gifting is from god and the power comes through you and not from you
4892688 i was not the lion but it fell to me to give the lions roar
4892689 youre having a lot of trouble on this one whats wrong with the standard model
4892690 have you ever seen the regulations it has to be completely independent must be sponsored to get on base have the qualities of both mother and father during deployments be a perfect hostess to four or 40 handle emergencies without military orders cope with the flu and move around the world have a kiss that cures anything from a childs torn valentine to a soldiers weary day have the patience of a saint when waiting for the unit to return stateside and have six pairs of soft hands
4892691 dont worry well make other military spouses to help besides its not the hands that are causing the problem its the heart it must swell with pride sustain the ache of separation beat soundly when its too tired to do so be large enough to say i understand when it doesnt and say i love you regardless
4892692 im too close to creating something unique already i have one who can heal itself when sick feed unexpected guests who are stuck in the area due to bad weather and wave goodbye to its spouse from a pier or runway and understand its important to the country that the spouse leave
4892693 you cannot imagine what this being can do or endure
4892694 can it think it can convert 1400 to 2 p m
4892695 i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model
4892696 firing rate dynamics in the hippocampus induced by trajectory learning
4892697 the hippocampus assigns distinct representations to input patterns to avoid interference across memories whereas neocortex uses overlapping representations that encode shared structure across many different experiences furthermore neocortex uses a small learning rate to gradually integrate new information with existing knowledge whereas hippocampus uses a large learning rate to encode episodic memories of specific events as they unfold
4892698 furthermore removing dependence of rate on behavioral parameters produced a similar dynamics of different past r for all the 3 segments and of same past r for segment 1 and 3 the same past r in segment 2 showed a nonsignificant change after this correction
4892699 in our experiment the activity patterns on the new trajectories were initially more correlated with the trajectories that shared the same current information fig 7 in segment 1 the initial rate correlation was high between same past trajectories because of similar head direction and immediate future locations but low between different past trajectories because of the head direction difference in segment 3 the initial rate correlation was high between different past trajectories because of the similarity in head direction lateral position and immediate future locations but low between same past trajectories because of the difference in these parameters in segment 2 the initial rate correlations were relatively high both between different past and between same past trajectories because of similar head direction lateral position and immediate future locations across all trajectories with more experience on new trajectories activity patterns became more similar with the trajectories that shared the same immediate previous experience and more different from those with different immediate previous experience regardless of the different initial conditions as mentioned above activity in all three segments on new trajectories became more separated from their different past trajectories and more correlated with their same past trajectories fig 7 indicating an increase in the influence of immediate past input on place cell activity
4892700 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4892701 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company
4892702 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4892703 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4892704 and so part of the cost is cushioning against that
4892705 you can make these up to one week in advance
4892706 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4892735 i was working for my mom until she decided to move
4892736 the company made me a scapegoat just like my three previous employers
4892737 while i am open to the initial nature of an assignment i am decidedly disposed that it be so oriented as to at least partially incorporate the experience enjoyed heretofore and that it be configured so as to ultimately lead to the application of more rarefied facets of financial management as the major sphere of responsibility
4892738 please call me after 5 30 because i am self employed and my employer does not know i am looking for another job

4892752 hallo mevrouw u heeft wellicht gemerkt dat de energie prijzen maar blijven stijgen wij bieden u een mogelijkheid om zich hiertegen te beschermen wij kunnen u huidige energie prijs vastklikken en dan blijft u ook bij prijsstijgingen u huidige tarief betalen en u kan gewoon bij u huidige leverancier blijven goed he wat vindt u van deze geweldige aanbieding
4892753 nou dat klinkt heel goed maar dan wil ik wel weten hoe dat precies werkt als ik mijn prijzen vastklik en de prijzen stijgen wie betaalt dat verschil dan aan mijn leverancier u
4892754 ja mevrouw ik heb het even nagevraagd maar niemand betaalt dat verschil want de prijs is vastgeklikt goed he
4892755 volgens mij is dat onmogelijk iets wordt duurder maar niemand die dat betaalt wat gebeurt er trouwens als de prijs daalt
4892756 nee de prijzen gaan niet dalen alleen nog maar stijgen want de olieprijs die stijgt alleen nog maar heeft u dat niet gehoord mevrouw
4892757 ik vind uw verhaal erg vreemd u wilt mijn energie tarief vastklikken terwijl die alleen nog maar zullen stijgen volgens u en doordat u mij vastklikt hoeft niemand het verschil te betalen dat is toch onmogelijk
4892758 ik denk niet dat u het snapt mevrouw dus laat maar

4892765 harris basic message is that the time has come to speak openly and honestly about religion he feels that the survival of civilization is in danger because of a taboo against questioning religious beliefs while highlighting what he regards as a particular problem posed by islam at this moment with respect to international terrorism harris makes a direct criticism of religion of all styles and persuasions he sees religion as an impediment to progress toward more enlightened approaches to spirituality and ethics
4892766 we dont have a word for not believing in zeus which is to say we are all atheists in respect to zeus and we dont have a word for not being an astrologer

4892796 why are we paying 1 3 million more than we have to
4892797 was the minority contracting preference intent to give huge firms a 5 percent discount so to speak
4892798 no doubt in my mind shaw lundquist or some other group would have probably justly criticized me for not following the division policy
4892799 if you take a look at the firms that were competing against especially the firms we might have been bid against on that particular project im pretty sure we were the smallest one
4892800 this particular example points out the need to at least take a look and make a conscious decision of how this program is working
4892801 at what point do you say ok were all on an equal playing field lets compete
4892802 these kinds of programs must be able to stand scrutiny
4892803 having upper limits on personal net worth or the gross revenues of the business has proven to give legal strength to the program because theres some defined limits
4892804 i had a difficult youth my father wasnt in the house
4892805 there were times where i experimented with drugs i drank you know in my teenage years
4892806 what i traced this to is a certain selfish necessary on my part i was so obsessed with me its not about me
4892807 when i find myself taking the wrong step i think a lot of the times its because im trying to protect myself instead of trying to do gods work
4892808 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4892809 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applied to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
4892810 liquor is allowed by their religion so we allow them
4892811 we have to understand the political reality that we are part of an alliance and we do not have absolute power so under such a government we focus on universal islamic values like fighting corruption
4892812 for starters states under the opposition alliance can reduce the number of gambling premises as gambling is strictly prohibited by all religions

4892827 our ticket sales early on were slightly ahead of where we were last year and that was a good indication because with a lot of the events ive noticed that theres been a drop off in attendance
4892828 last week we got tremendous growth in our ticket sales then just walk up traffic a lot of people weve got more walk up traffic than weve had at any previous event here

4892850 nos falt hacer el gol en el segundo tiempo tuvimos opciones para haberlo hecho pero no las concretamos y el primer tiempo lo regalamos porque entramos muy dormidos
4892851 el primer tiempo dejamos de ser intensos no tuvimos la pelota por lo tanto al corretear al rival y no tener el bal n no tienes llegada
4892852 me preocupa por los resultados porque hemos hecho algunos partidos muy buenos sobre todo en los primeros tiempos no hemos sacado el resultado adecuado en algunos partidos nos hab a faltado culminar bien el segundo tiempo donde nos hab a faltado culminar algunas cosas ahora fue el primer tiempo y no podemos ni un segundo subestimar eso ya lo hab amos platicado pero tambi n existe un rival que lo hizo bastante bien sobre todo en el primer tiempo donde marcaron la diferencia

4892875 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4892876 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4892877 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4892878 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4892879 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4892880 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4892881 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4892882 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4892883 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4892884 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4892885 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4892886 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4892887 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4892888 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it
4892889 i have been on both sides of it everybody would like to just go out there and just outrun the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them

4892909 there are great opportunities for a possible investment in this sector indonesia is a big country and is gifted with a huge farmland but unfortunately in some areas these farmlands are under developed because of lack of investment

4892912 vitale makes a powerful and likely irrefutable case that new york city mayors could have made major inroads in reducing homelessness had they adopted more progressive land use policies this part of the book alone is a major contribution to the ongoing debate about homelessness readers across the nation will benefit from what is now clearly one of the best books ever written about urban homelessness
4892913 in city of disorder alex vitale provides a wise and balanced analysis of the preoccupation with social order in new york city that flowered under giulianis watch on the one side neoliberal housing and employment markets were increasing the numbers of people who were displaced and homeless the failure of government on all levels to regulate the market forces driving this development or to intervene to provide alternatives for the people affected meant that people coped as they always have by camping on the streets and panhandling and by turning to drugs and drink these behaviors in turn created popular political support for the coercive social controls that came to characterize city policy in the nineties but neither the homeless nor the public were responsible for the limited alternatives which drove this mean result
4892914 vitale presents an important critical analysis of quality of life and zero tolerance policing that have serious civil rights and civil liberties implications and are too often accepted without careful scrutiny as the solution to urban problems

4893001 this is not about a logo on a piece of paper it is an opportunity for us all to embrace a new vibrant and forward looking identity and ethos which says that belfast has come of age we all know how unique the city and its people are and now we have a golden opportunity to take the message that this is belfasts time its moment and we want to share it with everyone be inspired
4893002 you have to get the people who live there to be the best advocates for the city or else you dont really have much

4893005 large parks will always exceed singular narratives they are larger than the designers will for authorship they exceed over regulation and contrivance and they always evolve into more multifarious and unpredictable formations than anyone could have envisaged at the outset they are complex dynamic systems as such the designer of large parks can only ever set out a highly specified physical base from which more open ended processes can formations take root if this staged groundwork is too constrained or too complicated or too mannered it will eventually calcify under the weight of its own construction if it is too loose or too open or too weak it will eventually lose any form of legibility and order the trick is to design a large park framework that is sufficiently robust to lend structure and identity while also having sufficient pliancy and give to adapt to changing demands and ecologies over time

4893011 a normal bus in a normal street conducts x passengers a day
4893012 with a dedicated lane it can transport 2x a day if you have an articulated bus in a dedicated lane 2 7x passengers if you add a boarding tube you can achieve 3 4x passengers and if you add double articulated buses you can have four times as many passengers as a normal bus in a normal street

4893059 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
4893060 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4893061 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
4893062 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
4893063 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
4893064 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4893065 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation
4893066 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4893067 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4893068 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
4893069 just a dream on the gac top 20 and cmt top 20 countdowns

4893077 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4893078 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4893079 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4893080 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4893081 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4893082 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4893083 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4893084 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4893085 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
4893086 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change

4893089 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4893090 the page was removed by china com cn however there was a baidu cached page no mention of crooked teeth and chubby fat face
4893091 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4893092 that papers are biased useless as far as most things are concerned but not sourav
4893093 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
4893094 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4893095 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4893096 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4893097 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4893098 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4893099 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4893100 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4893101 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4893102 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4893103 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4893104 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4893105 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4893106 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4893107 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4893108 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4893109 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4893110 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4893111 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4893112 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4893113 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4893114 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4893115 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4893116 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4893117 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4893118 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4893119 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4893120 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating
4893121 width of the nose and the length of the face
4893122 it is a tradition in china that at events costumes of the different ethnic groups are worn to symbolize that they live together peacefully and in happiness

4893132 even when we were in spartanburg he was still there and i was telling him to watch my technique and let me know when my footwork is bad and when im doing something wrong
4893133 hes been helping out the corners letting us know if youre playing a little too far off or youre playing this way thats why i did this route
4893134 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4893135 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4893136 im sure that america will see that like me barack obama is a man of truth and family values

4893142 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
4893143 more small donations and more concentrated gathering of large ones by a small number of wealthy and increasingly powerful bundlers
4893144 theres an emotional involvement that ive never seen in any campaign ive been involved with
4893145 the list of contributors includes people who have never contributed before or never contributed at so high a level
4893146 ive come across names people ive solicited who have contributed significant dollars who i dont even know who i havent ever met
4893147 if you organize one of these events it doesnt take very long to get up to a large number because they raise a lot of money
4893148 were very enthused about our fundraising success in minnesota and are proud that john mccains kept his promise to the american people about public financing
4893149 barack obama did not keep that promise and after obamas last high dollar fundraiser in the twin cities minnesotans know his talk about a parallel public financing system is just that talk
4893150 if you look at his total fundraising tens of thousands of people who are giving small amounts make up most of the money obama has raised in minnesota
4893151 i am not sure how we would operate without them
4893152 gaston county has never told and will never tell any athlete where they have to go for treatment after an injury we leave that up to the parents and athletes to decide
4893153 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
4893154 it is more a subject of joy than of regret that we have so few of the desperate characters which compose modern regular armies but it proves more forcibly the necessity of obliging every citizen to be a soldier this was the case with the greeks and romans and must be that of every free state where there is no oppression there can be no pauper hirelings
4893155 the governor is constitutionally the commander of the militia of the state that is to say of
4893156 with regards to the second amendment there is no misinterpretation as to what our forefathers were thinking when they added this amendment
4893157 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4893158 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4893159 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4893160 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4893161 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4893162 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4893163 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4893164 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4893165 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4893166 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4893167 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4893168 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4893169 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4893170 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it
4893171 i have been on both sides of it everybody would like to just go out there and just outrun the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
4893172 hey lynn maybe you could help me 1st off i enjoy your blog thank you 2nd i am not a scrapbooker i have a workshop coming up that the hostess wants scrapbooking i thought i would do 2 cards and one 6x6 page i love how mary did her pages but i am not a scrapbooker and i am panicing do you have any ideas pictures on what would be easy for me to use as a 6x6 and progress to 12x12 scrapbook page do you know any great ways to take a card and progress it into a 12x12 scrapbook page thank you so much for your help
4893173 clearly we need a senior and a very independent mind to be the environment minister when they have such weighty and important decisions to be made in the first few months of their tenure
4893174 it is a violation of federal law to intimidate oppress injure or threaten people because of their race and because those people are exercising and enjoying rights guaranteed and protected by the laws and constitution of the united states
4893175 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
4893176 wh wh wh and and ive been uh consistent on this from the start flip flop flip flop if you dont agree or ask me to clarify further its because you hate black people
4893177 if someone could just show me how to do the exercises i am sure i would be fine on my own

4893187 thats easy for you to say you dont have these ugly things on your chest
4893188 just look at how ugly they are ill bet youve never seen any worse
4893189 the only way you can prove to me that my boobs are not ugly is if you would suck them for me inhein chooso

4893194 when we started our gold fund in 1993 which proved to be six or seven years too soon i mistakenly thought that my downside was protected by the fact that jewelry demand was fairly vibrant but i was wrong i think gold moves up and down based on investment demand mostly

4893314 we made dogs and dogs made us some of the genetic research is fairly controversial but there is some evidence that wolves and humans have been together for 150 000 years and other evidence that suggests it could have happened before we were even fully human

4893401 establishing a presence on facebook was something boomj was keenly aware of reaching out both to facebooks older demographic and the 18 25 year olds to introduce their parents to

4893418 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4893419 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4893420 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4893421 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4893422 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4893423 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4893424 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4893425 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4893426 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4893429 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4893430 its the equivalent of an interest free loan from the government
4893431 because you still have to pay taxes on the withdrawal its not a particularly attractive way to fund a down payment on a home

4893433 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
4893434 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4893435 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4893436 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4893437 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
4893438 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
4893439 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its probably going to set in
4893440 im healthy my leg is a little sore just from the rounds
4893441 silver is silver i once heard an athlete say that his silver tasted like gold
4893442 to me silver is silver bronze is bronze and gold is gold
4893443 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
4893444 this album may be the next thing i work on in 2009 or it may not happen for another few years what i can say is that its getting closer than its ever been tiger army is not breaking up a solo album would include members of the band but while roots music has always been an element of tiger armys sound a whole album in the style of outlaw heart or in the orchard would be a different thing so im just going to call it nick 13
4893445 when i wrote outlaw heart for the first tiger army album i figured people would hate it as a lot of our audience came from the world of punk rock i released it anyway because it was a song i loved and it meant alot to me people were more open minded than i thought and it became not only one of my favorites but one of the favorites of our fans
4893446 ive been asked about doing a recording or project that was entirely country based since the first album was released it was an intriguing idea to me that i kept coming back to over the years but i was always too busy with tiger army one of these days its gonna be time to make time
4893447 so we are looking for booking labels we are looking for people who can get gigs and help with promotion get us a gig get a share of the income if thats what thrives you

4893463 what do you think an individual person can do to try to make the world a better place
4893464 with the signature of the georgian president on this ceasefire accord all russian troops and any irregular or paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4893465 this is the understanding i had with president sarkozy yesterday that when president saakashvili signed this ceasefire accord there would be an immediate withdrawal of russian forces from georgian territory
4893466 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4893467 its an unprovoked brutal invasion and attack to kill georgian democracy and end the independence of georgia and we together will deter it
4893468 russia has lots of tanks but russia no tank is enough to crush the will of the free people freedoms light will never die here
4893469 to act in such a way as will enable any order the court may take to have its appropriate effects
4893470 the united states does carry some weight in this part of the world because georgia wants very much to become a member of nato and according to diplomats we spoke to here that seems to be the crux of the problem
4893471 georgia has its nato aspirations and these are aspirations russia is going to do its best to try to quell
4893472 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4893473 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4893474 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias
4893475 i am deeply concerned by the notion that russia has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4893476 i am deeply concerned by the notion that the united states has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4893477 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4893478 what people should really be worrying about is natos inclusion of poland and the recent decision to put missile bases on their soil now thats something bush has been pushing for sometime now against russias wishes
4893479 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4893480 the saakashvili government has not invaded or attacked five of its neighbours it has not started two major wars or caused the death of millions of people it has not hosted or sponsored nearly every major international terrorist group it has not defied 17 resolutions of the security council each one backed by the threat of force it has not corrupted a united nations sanctions regime nor blocked its arms inspectors nor bribed high officials in member states it has not developed or tried to chemical biological and nuclear weapons nor has it used them on its own or other countries citizens it is not a bestial dictatorship whose people would be only too happy to see it gone it is in fact a popularly elected pro western democratic government imperfect as democracies go but a paragon by the standards of the region certainly when compared to the medvedev putin thugocracy that runs russia
4893481 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4893482 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4893483 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4893484 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4893485 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4893486 all i see when i look into putins eyes is k g b
4893487 this isnt the way to deal with problems in the 21st century
4893488 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4893489 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4893490 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4893491 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4893492 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4893493 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4893494 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4893515 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4893516 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4893517 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
4893518 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4893519 instead of giving these two dedicated law enforcement officers the heroes treatment
4893520 you may disagree with me but i believe the legal action taken against these border patrol veterans was the bush administrations way of sending a message to all us border patrol agents dont do your jobs if you do youll be punished
4893521 this reminds me of the incidents when cops who did their jobs protecting and serving the people of new york would be singled out for punishment harassment and loss of their jobs
4893522 the message in the compean ramos case seems to be do your jobs and youll be punished ignore illegal aliens violating us laws and youll be rewarded with pay increases promotions and other goodies by cynical political leaders who favor an unbridled invasion of the us by millions of illegal aliens
4893523 how is it that our political leaders tell americans they are do everything possible to secure our borders and protect our sovereignty yet they hide and disregard reports of incursions by mexican military and police personnel suspected of providing protection for drug and human traffickers
4893524 in the compean ramos case the federal government actually punished law enforcement officers for attempting to stop an incursion by a drug trafficker the american people are being lied to by government officials while at the same time being placed in harms way since many of these incursions are perpetrated by armed mexicans
4893525 most of you numb nuts are from the south where did youre balls go no wonder why you lost the civil war you were a bunch of pussies then and you are now
4893526 and to that idiot who said that there was in fact too much water snow icecaps so god could flood the world and wipe out humanity well thats not a loving all caring god that i choose to worship
4893527 as for creationism thats not science its stand up comedy
4893528 astrophysics has precious little overlap with evolutionary biology this is why they are different disciplines the clue is in them having different names and being in different departments in the science building of your local campus im sure that if you went to a school that taught science you would also have noticed that the physics teacher and the biology teacher were two separate people one may have been a woman the other may have had a moustache
4893529 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

4893531 no empire building no foreign wars cut taxes and spending etc
4893532 there is no shame in taking advantage of a fool
4893533 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4893534 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4893535 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4893536 equally citizens are entitled to expect reasonable behaviour from our police so lets wait and see before we jump to any conclusions
4893537 the campaign by the union movement continues to run to ensure that we remind the electorate that we are still a long way from restoring fairness and balance to australias workplaces
4893538 many people out there think it amp squo s gone it amp squo s not
4893539 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4893540 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4893541 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4893542 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee
4893543 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4893544 the way we change the democratic party is to change the way we win

4893546 can you please quiet him down im trying to sleep
4893547 this is the first time i have really been away from louisiana for this long
4893548 its just been maturing man just maturing and getting better and knowing what the priorities are
4893549 my priority is to play basketball and help my team get better thats what i am doing right now you have to establish a work habit youve got to establish some type of discipline and figure out a way to create your way in this game thats what i have been doing
4893550 it was the experience of being around guys who are more disciplined
4893551 seeing how hard work pays off thats been really the key seeing these veterans and what they do and why they are so good thats helped me tremendously tremendously that has helped establish me as a player and wanting to be great in this league
4893552 but you look past that because youve got a job to do and you have a life to live you have to make some money
4893553 the organization thought it was a great thing i did staying around and bettering myself to help our team next year defend a championship it was a good idea not only because i am working but because i am getting better as a person also
4893554 its not only great seeing the kids around boston but its great seeing them experience seeing a professional athlete live and in color
4893555 some people dont get that chance they dont get to see kevin garnett all the time they dont get to see paul pierce i just thought it would have a great impact on the kids if they got to see me more just to interact with me and get to hear me its great to have an impact on a kids life
4893556 this is me i am still a big kid anyway
4893557 i for one am a believer a believer that theres more to this life than just what one sees on the surface crying one morning a year after my mothers death because i could not recall her holding our newborn http www typepad com t trackback 3094292 32448586

4893560 these trends are slow moving but theyre diminishing the significance of private clubs relative to the total industry
4893561 generally the trend has been negative across all three categories
4893562 the total supply of golf courses is up mostly municipal courses they grew while country clubs were contracting theres a lot of competition because the newer courses offer better facilities than the old time country clubs might have
4893563 where theyve certainly run into more competition is for the avid golfer and thats where golf in general has had some problems
4893564 most of that is because people have less free time available another factor is the economic downturn since 2005
4893565 business is being done in different forms with much more emphasis globally
4893566 a lot of people in developing corporations are going overseas a local connection on a golf course may not be as significant as it was in the past also changes in tax laws in the 1980s made it less advantageous to the companies for those who can afford it a country club still sounds like a nice luxury
4893567 were seeing more and more that clubs have recognized in recent years that they have to keep up or enhance their facilities but that capital investment can be difficult depending on the local economy

4893573 de tranen liepen van de week over haar wangen toen onze achten de finale haalden wat was ze trots ik moet er niet aan denken wat er gebeurt als wij een medaille winnen maar dat geldt ook voor mijzelf ik denk dat ik mij opnieuw geen raad weet met mijn emoties
4893574 de ontwikkeling in het zwemmen gaat momenteel te snel het is hetzelfde als wanneer bij het voetbal van de ene op de andere dag de doelpalen verder uit elkaar worden gezet en de lat hoger komt te liggen zodat er meer wordt gescoord zulke kunstgrepen heeft de zwemsport niet nodig
4893575 maar dat neemt niet weg dat ik hier ontwikkelingen heb gezien die me zorgen baren innovatie is goed maar we moeten de sport beschermen tegen excessen gezien de frequentie waarmee hier in peking wereldrecords worden gezwommen en de marges waarmee dat gebeurt kan niet verondersteld worden dat zoiets louter het gevolg is van goede training van de atleten

4893590 it means i have an opportunity to stand on the floor of history and watch something amazing happen
4893591 i thought i was in pretty good shape but then at 5 oclock this past thursday i got an email saying sorry lots of people wanted tickets youre on a waitlist i was angry
4893592 people have to understand there was a tremendous outpouring of requests for credentials we wish we could accommodate everyone but it truly was a first come first serve process
4893593 you were the wet girl in the blue skirt and short sleeves doing the wiggly walk you really moved
4893594 mikes recent return to tv one has been immensely well received by viewers and we are excited to have him hosting this series
4893595 im thrilled to face a new challenge beyond current affairs broadcasting
4893596 to balance my broadcasting career with a different genre of television and show people new facets of myself as a presenter is an exciting opportunity
4893597 this led to the conclusion that animals which were able to clearly associate the electric stimulus with their action i e touching the prey and consequently were able to predict and control the stressor did not show considerable or persistent stress indicators
4893598 the scanner which is fixed to the roof of the car constantly moves laser beams back and forth through a mirror on a vertical axis it moves the laser beam from top to bottom and back again
4893599 if anything gets in the way such as a pedestrian the laser beam is reflected and sent back to the scanner the software analyzes the information while the car is in motion and steers the vehicle in the right direction the system comprises two back to back laser scanners that rotate in the same way as the flashing lights on police cars and are thus able to see all of the cars surroundings
4893600 at a speed of 36 kilometers per hour the car moves 10 meters per second consequently the measured data must constantly be adjusted to the cars current position
4893601 at a price of 17 800 euros the scanner is much too expensive for use in private vehicles even though it is significantly cheaper than conventional models the main purpose of taking part in this competition was to show what computers are capable of doing when they have the right sensors such as laser scanners and cameras
4893602 among other things our laser scanners are applied to assess the visibility of advertising billboards
4893603 this makes it possible to determine quality criteria for the placement of a billboard which could be reflected in the price a billboard that can be seen in its entirety from any angle can be rented at a higher price than a board that passers by can only see from one angle
4893604 what does it mean to you to trust in christ
4893605 and what does it mean on a daily basis i mean what does that really look like
4893606 as a starting point it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends and it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
4893607 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
4893608 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4893609 keep in mind the way that stem cell legislation that was vetoed by the president was structured what it said was you could only use embryos that were about to be discarded that had been created as a consequence of attempts at in vitro fertilization
4893610 its not like people who are in favor of stem cell research are going around thinking to themselves boy lets go destroy some embryos thats not the perspective that i think people come to that issue on
4893611 would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of constitution
4893612 although i dont think theres any doubt about his intellectual brilliance
4893613 was a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person
4893614 we do have to be careful to make sure that we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money
4893615 and i wanted to hire some people to do relief if i took federal money to help in that relief i wouldnt be able to say i only want people to believe like we do
4893616 we do want to make sure of is that as a general principal were not using federal funding to discriminate
4893617 but that is only when it comes to the narrow program that is being funded by the federal government that does not affect any of the other ministries that are taking place
4893618 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman now for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix
4893619 gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for the state to say you know what thats all right i dont think that in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage is i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
4893620 you know if youve got book sales of 25 million
4893621 im not suggesting that everybody that is making over 250 000 is living on easy street
4893622 but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is if we believe in good schools if we believe in good roads if we want to make sure that kids can go to college if we dont want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation then weve got to pay for these things they dont come for free and it is irresponsible i believe it is irresponsible intergenerationally for us to invest or for us to spend 10 billion a month on a war and not having a way to pay for it that i think is unacceptable

4893626 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4893627 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4893628 loyalty to the us and receive material benefits for the americans it is an opportunity to expand its military presence across the world including closer to russia for nato this is an additional risk many nato countries are unhappy with this including the germans and the french
4893629 a program could be implemented to create orbital ballistic missiles capable of reaching us territory via the south pole skirting us air defense bases
4893630 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4893631 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4893632 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4893633 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4893634 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4893635 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4893636 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4893637 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4893638 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4893639 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4893640 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4893641 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4893642 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4893643 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it
4893644 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
4893645 with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4893646 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
4893647 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
4893648 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4893649 chairman prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4893650 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4893651 liquor is allowed by their religion so we allow them
4893652 we have to understand the political reality that we are part of an alliance and we do not have absolute power so under such a government we focus on universal islamic values like fighting corruption
4893653 for starters states under the opposition alliance can reduce the number of gambling premises as gambling is strictly prohibited by all religions
4893654 permits or licences to sell alcohol should either be limited or only allowed for areas inhabited by non muslims
4893655 if we were asked for more training teams that would be really hard for us to do were just about capped out at what were providing now
4893656 we have these pity parties in kabul about how much the afghan soldiers need no they need good leadership
4893657 were doing a little bit of nation building but thats ok because its going to help us with counter insurgency
4893658 hes asking his military people to provide those kinds of services and knowledge base for things they his troops may not be very expert in
4893659 we are providing the security for this road then the contractors will come and they can start their work
4893660 such ambitious plans as long as they are complemented by sustained resources and a realistic assessment of timelines are not a bad thing
4893661 the real problem comes if ambitious rhetoric is unmatched by funding or long term commitment since that raises local expectations and leaves them frustrated
4893662 david is going to be in the surprise finale they always have a segment to do the handover to showcase the next city to host the olympics
4893663 it was good to come out here and get a win
4893664 we had some early jitters there were some positives and some negatives but coming out here and getting the win will give us confidence moving forward
4893665 it was good to see her come in and have an impact right away
4893666 she was solid in goal we need that to be successful i was impressed with gaby garton coming in and making some good saves in her first action
4893667 it was a good game since we only had two days of preseason so we approached this game just like a training session
4893668 we selected 20 players and rotated them evenly playing two mixed teams because we are still looking at a lot of different pieces
4893669 a clear greenish non muscat wine with a floral flavour and a dry taste is far more interesting than describing a wine as nice
4893670 a producer who has made a few fairly modest wines that i think are really nice
4893671 an ambitious wine that failed to get four stars because its not very good
4893672 the human palate can only differentiate between sweet salty bitter and acidic wines cannot be salty
4893673 referring to a set of english words which are considered profane including popular or slang terms for excretory functions sexual activity
4893674 losing matthew didnt help to win by 39 points is a good result
4893675 in the last quarter i think we probably put our cues in the rack a little bit and didnt really play the best footy but it really didnt matter
4893676 they are the benchmark no question theres no question they are a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin
4893677 i think if they play their best theres no one who will beat them
4893678 wow this has happened to me so many times but i was always shy to admit it
4893679 crash of united 93 in pennsylvania left an awfully small hole on the ground and no visible wreckage or bodies
4893680 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
4893681 its not very popular to talk about toilets and excrement and where to go when you are menstruating this is something that makes people feel uncomfortable
4893682 five thousand children die every day of diarrhoea because of a lack of hygiene and sanitation and nobody really cares
4893683 we have to understand that what we eat and the products we buy have an immediate implication for the availability of the worlds water resources
4893684 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
4893685 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been
4893686 now its all about its there and we have to live with it and the question is okay what to do how to adapt

4893703 it was our first game and i think we did a good job
4893704 it was important to win the game we were a bit nervous especially as they played well with the long ball and it was not easy for us
4893705 we wanted to win our first game and start well i think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us because it is just the beginning of the season
4893706 the spirit of the football club was there for everybody to see
4893707 the fitness levels in the second half were incredible as was the passion and the drive the character was tremendous
4893708 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4893709 the whole performance was fantastic to come from behind twice and win was outstanding i would have settled for a point at one stage

4893713 roughly 50 percent of americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society
4893714 we can no longer stand by and allow people of inability to be ridiculed and passed over with this legislation employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers simply because they have some idea of what they are doing

4893717 this new law should be real good for people like me
4893718 as a senator with no abilities i believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every american with no abilities it is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every american citizen regardless of his or her inadequacy with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so

4893739 she was standing very excited on the edge of the pool and wanted to go into the water she didnt have a costume with her so i gave her one but it was far too big and we had to tie it back with strings britta didnt care she just wanted to learn how to swim she was very independent i taught her to swim within four weeks
4893740 she was small and always considered herself to be at a disadvantage but her gliding in water was superb she had a lot of stamina and thats why i recommended her for a place at the sports school in potsdam
4893741 wanted me to stay in the training and not to take a break
4893742 when i swam badly before i used to think somehow i was a bad person now i know how to differentiate between my swimming life and my personal life
4893743 when she had her head free she was able to motivate herself incredibly the years break psychological training and her boyfriend have done her a lot of good
4893744 it was a sensational swim she is an absolute super talent and this is just the start of her career
4893745 we germany have a bad history of doping the only solution is to declare why our swimmers are as fast as they are thats just the way it is we have to check blood we have to make ourselves available and will do at the start and end of each altitude camp
4893746 i want to create my own anti doping file in which i publish my tests
4893747 the implications in questions put to her in budapest hurt me
4893748 shes very down to earth and modest success will not go to her head
4893749 no id just like to continue my life as it is now i dont worry about money ive agreed with my body that ill train intensively for another two years and then well see im satisfied with my whole life right now ive found an inner quiet

4893755 we have plenty of help here and we are matching the 5 percent tax discount with our own
4893756 so far a lot of people have been buying dining room furniture
4893757 traditionally we are busy on the tax free holiday people are buying some really big stuff
4893758 last year sales were light during the week of the tax free weekend and then we made up for it during the weekend
4893759 people always think we make more money during the tax holiday
4893760 but does 5 percent off really convince you to buy a new guitar if you did not need one
4893761 between the economy and preparing for costs to heat their homes this winter
4893762 we could have gone a little longer without buying one but the tax free holiday just put it over the edge
4893763 now we are headed to sears and the home depot for a new comforter
4893764 we have all hands on deck to help us out this weekend
4893765 weve worked with the manufacturers to offer some extra discounts to people there has been a steady flow of customers since we opened this morning
4893766 it is such a quality couch perfect for a cold winter and it had a great price
4893767 it definitely had a day after thanksgiving type of feel to it
4893768 sometimes inclement weather is good for business but we had rain for so long that it was hurting us i am glad a few rays of sunshine could bring people out
4893769 byrd threw strikes and got us deep into the game
4893770 hes going to give up some hits because he throws strikes in a lot of games what he did would have been good enough to win but not tonight halladay was outstanding he had a great cutter and kept the ball down
4893771 im never happy to lose but i saw some things that made me think that im going to be a good fit for this team
4893772 you have to tip your cap to the way halladay pitched
4893773 it was a change up that was supposed to be away but i threw it down and in
4893774 we had to bring in the infield in that situation but wells found a hole
4893775 you dont know who to tell and whether to laugh or be ashamed
4893776 i just went for a walk and i got 30
4893777 ive promoted 1 152 cross country events in the past 23 years
4893778 the official bike of the mike mahon cross country organization
4893779 im here for a reason im here for the kids
4893780 were looking for new visions new challenges new ideas for the cross country community
4893781 im looking for a major big break breaking down barriers
4893782 i had a man overdose in my presence that might have started the ball of fear rolling
4893783 i made a commitment to myself i was going to enhance my life
4893784 i was a ward of the state and came here to framingham in my mid teens if youre a foster kid and you find a town this is my town thisll be my town
4893785 people are throwing out the money and others of us are going around getting it and getting categorized because of it
4893786 i dont have a problem pushing a cart around the block for 35
4893787 i guess if i saw someone rummaging through trash people just assume and attack
4893788 people who need the cans have to have money for various reasons
4893789 the mother said the kids love picking up the cans
4893790 its so simple and so obvious theres no reason not to
4893791 but people see you going through the barrels and they think something else is going on
4893792 the way they look the way they talk the way they go through barrels

4893796 shalat malam mengenangkan saat saat perjumpaan manusia dengan sang kekasih itulah miraj ruhani orang mukmin
4893797 buku ini menyajikan teladan indah rasulullah saw dan orang orang saleh dalam menegakkan shalat malam sangat bermanfaat
4893798 kami baru takut terhadap umat islam jika mereka telah melaksanakan shalat subuh seperti melaksanakan shalat jumat
4893799 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4893800 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4893801 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4893802 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4893803 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4893804 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4893805 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4893806 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4893807 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4893808 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4893809 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4893810 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4893811 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4893812 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4893813 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4893814 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4893815 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4893816 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4893817 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4893818 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4893819 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4893820 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4893821 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4893822 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4893823 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4893824 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4893825 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4893826 i am going to dedicate this song for sarah sister she is going through something tough as me or maybe even something tougher so i am going to dedicate this song to her so as to encourage her i am not good at words but this song will help me convey the message i want for her dd sarah sister you have me ilu you told me with you i wont have to walk alone amp so i am returning you this too as long as we walk together we are not alone dd
4893827 the spirit of the lord is upon me he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted and recovery of sight to the blind
4893828 for one reason i cant wait to have council everytime spending time with the third is equivalent to all the funny lame and time of exhilaration this is what excites me and abang to go for council lor in fact he was so random as to tell me that he love council and yeah i will always agree with what he says cause its the fact what i wonder what will happen when we all step down and a life without council sure very boring non enticing and the sensation of something amiss tuhin rocks because he will always give us social benefits that will efficiently allocate resources to the society willy is a very nice and good buddy altogether this equation makes up our third students council who came out with all the interesting gags and trivia for orientation o2 will be fun as the ogls gave us positive feedback about the games i hope my part will entice people too never forget that the council is small yet we can survive thru all storms and weather all rains or shines
4893829 when it comes down to the crunch she is a good kid
4893830 it wouldve been a rough one to lose because we had so many opportunities
4893831 weve been scuffling weve struggled to score runs maybe this is the one that gets us to that point where we can run off a few weve been through it a bunch of times we cant scuffle anymore thats the bottom line
4893832 ive never seen our team struggle so much as a group
4893833 we left numerous opportunities out there it probably weighs on us a little bit but the important thing is we won and hopefully today we can break out
4893834 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4893835 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4893836 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4893837 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4893838 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4893839 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4893840 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4893841 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4893842 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4893843 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4893844 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4893845 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4893846 who are open to doing something on the production side
4893847 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4893848 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4893849 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4893850 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4893851 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4893852 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4893853 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4893854 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4893855 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4893856 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4893857 this project provides an excellent example of how new technologies can help reduce energy use while still providing affordable and sustainable housing
4893858 we are thrilled to have our nansulate pt thermal insulation and corrosion resistance coating included as an integral part of this alternative housing project we look forward to the new opportunities for growth in this market as more governments back these types of projects which tie together earth friendly and energy saving needs with new technology solutions in an affordable package for the greatest overall impact
4893859 weve got to give this industry a chance we just cant throw it on the scrapheap
4893860 we do believe in liberalising trade we have one of the best records in the world when it comes to the fundamental structural adjustment
4893861 nothing quite settled right with me i was interested in doing more techie work and didnt want to do conservation corps or volunteer coordination
4893862 my loans were deferred for the year i got a free transportation pass from the program it was hard for me to complain when most of my clients had two kids and were living off 500 a month
4893863 that allows members to share experiences best practices and challenges
4893864 make sure to welcome the person and provide them with opportunities
4893865 we say it is bully boy tactics putting people under a terrible amount of pressure and you know we have to react
4893866 our members wil react to this the decision will be made this week about what type of reaction they have but we think this is going to lead to a big industrial dispute
4893867 last year there were 60 qbs that started in the regular season
4893868 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4893869 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4893870 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4893871 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4893872 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4893873 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4893874 hey i did this last night before sleep it must be almost time for sleep
4893875 that if the scripture verses that begin each chapter were removed the textbook would likely be approved
4893876 its very discriminating they dont rule against muslim or hindu or jewish themes or so forth only those with a definite christian theme
4893877 the number of accidents over the past 10 years has halved thats well known the ideal would be to have none
4893878 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4893879 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4893880 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4893881 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4893882 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4893883 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4893884 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4893885 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4893886 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4893887 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4893888 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4893889 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4893890 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4893891 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4893892 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4893893 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4893894 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4893895 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4893896 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4893897 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4893898 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4893899 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4893900 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4893901 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4893902 the potential legal implications of texting while driving go far beyond the possibility of a mere traffic violation
4893903 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
4893904 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
4893905 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
4893906 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
4893907 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4893908 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4893909 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4893910 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4893911 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4893912 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4893913 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4893914 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4893915 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4893916 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4893917 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
4893918 its not very popular to talk about toilets and excrement and where to go when you are menstruating this is something that makes people feel uncomfortable
4893919 five thousand children die every day of diarrhoea because of a lack of hygiene and sanitation and nobody really cares
4893920 we have to understand that what we eat and the products we buy have an immediate implication for the availability of the worlds
4893921 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
4893922 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been or where or who has been contributing to it
4893923 now its all about its there and we have to live with it and the question is okay what to do how to adapt
4893924 i was encouraged today by a lot of the opportunities to teach and coach
4893925 im proud to say i think we are further along at this point than we were the previous two years but it will be critical to take what we saw here today and learn from it when we hit the field again monday
4893926 clearly we need a senior and a very independent mind to be the environment minister when they have such weighty and important decisions to be made in the first few months of their tenure
4893927 i ordered some business cards from vista print in the uk and i am very happy with the results the business cards were nicely printed on both sides of the card and arrived within 7 days of placing the order
4893928 ive used vistaprint many times and theyve always exceeded my expectations for example i ordered 250 business cards and the price including priority shipping from vistaprint was still about 20 cheaper than kinkos the quality is great only heavyweight quality card stock value is incredible and shipping was very fast vistaprint is a great solution for my business and eliminates alot of stress
4893929 i have had phenomenal experiences with all the things ive ordered from vistaprint in the past 19 months this includes birth announcements envelopes photo magnets address labels custom envelopes holiday cards etc with multiple orders in each case i was able to customize my order completely online preview and after placing my orders i always received the items in less time
4893930 i use vistaprint occasionally to print stuff for my business you cant beat 68 for 5000 business cards i use them for referral cards and mass mailings
4893931 were striving to post a seven figure surplus and im pretty happy about that
4893932 a lot depends on the next seven weeks with the finals if we do post a million dollar profit itll be almost as good as beating collingwood
4893933 more time with the kids no more waking up at 5 driving for two hours then coming home really late because of traffic
4893934 the club put a contract to me last week so were just working through the finer details and hopefully that will be signed off in the next week or so
4893935 i look to play five or six games next year and if ill get through that well sit down and look at 2010
4893936 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4893937 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4893938 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4893939 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4893940 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4893941 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4893942 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4893943 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4893944 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4893945 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4893946 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4893947 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4893948 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4893949 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4893950 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4893951 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
4893952 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
4893953 i went to the alehouse a knave is a knave
4893954 one of the very special efforts to me was flying three full size sport kites simultaneously standing in the back of a red convertible down the main street of long beach wash with a police escort with hundreds and hundreds of spectators that lined the sidewalks including the mayor chief of police and the fire chief
4893955 it pleases me that i have been given the opportunity to share my love of kite flying to the people of niagara along with so many other kite fliers that have come from every part of this planet
4893956 con necting the past present and future with a kite string
4893957 i just enjoy seeing all the color in the air all the shapes
4893958 its amazing to me to be able to fly all the kites in the same area
4893959 these kite fliers are so into what theyre doing that it doesnt seem to bother them in the least

4893968 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
4893969 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
4893970 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

4893974 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4893975 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4893976 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4893977 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4893978 well if you want to have the rabies shots you can go to the hospital to get them

4893990 no it wasnt awkward until you said well this is awkward
4893991 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4893992 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4893993 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4893994 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4893995 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4893996 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4893997 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4893998 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4893999 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4894000 bref un truc de communication quil vaut mieux pas expliquer trop longtemps parce que a devient fumeux
4894001 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4894002 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4894003 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4894004 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4894005 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4894006 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4894007 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4894008 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4894009 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4894010 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4894011 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4894012 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4894013 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4894014 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4894015 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4894016 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4894017 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4894018 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4894019 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4894020 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4894021 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4894029 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation said mbeki the mediator for the zimbabwe talks
4894030 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit said the minister who declined to be named
4894031 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned fat prophets analyst gavin wendt said

4894034 gas prices have more than doubled since my opponent took office less than four years ago melissa bean has voted repeatedly against increasing american production and creating american jobs she just cast the deciding vote to let congress take an undeserved five week vacation one which many americans cannot afford due to washingtons inaction the american people need proactive leadership in washington that will stand up for them

4894039 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4894040 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4894041 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4894042 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4894043 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4894044 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4894045 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4894046 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4894047 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4894048 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4894049 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4894050 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4894051 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4894052 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4894053 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4894054 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4894055 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4894056 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4894057 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4894058 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4894059 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4894060 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4894061 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4894062 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4894063 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4894064 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4894065 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4894066 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4894067 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said
4894068 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond he added
4894069 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4894070 the correction isnt over the td bank analysts said adding that prices have further to fall particularly in
4894071 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices said ethan harris chief us economist at lehman brothers who sees prices falling between 25 and 30 percnt in the correction phase of a cycle he sees ending in late 2009

4894111 no se pueden ver como cultura son una forma b rbara de entretenimiento y debe detenerse y esperamos que el resultado sea una prohibici n de las peleas a nivel federal
4894112 no hay duda que est prohibido en todos los estados de estados unidos pero tampoco hay duda de que siguen jugando gallos en todos los estados ilegalmente

4894125 whatever the propaganda war beijing is perceived to be playing etims capability to strike china should not be under estimated
4894126 etim was established to create an independent islamic state in xinjiang but the avowed goal of etim has changed in the last five years under the influence of al qaeda etim began to believe in the global jihad agenda
4894127 china sees the ultimate resolution of the minority problem as assimilation it thinks the problem will go away once xinjiang becomes indistinguishable from the rest of china
4894128 the economy is controlled by hans the uighurs are working for the hans
4894129 we did not want to see this but the problem in xinjiang is increasingly becoming an armed conflict
4894130 in china if you criticize government policy youre not going to end up in jail in xinjiang if you criticize the government youre identified as a separatist sympathizer
4894131 there is an atmosphere of fear in xinjiang people know they can get arrested and disappear and that has happened to people they know
4894132 the yardstick should be what is a crime and what isnt it shouldnt be what people advocate
4894133 what were likely to see in next few years is a very renewed repressive campaign against terrorism and it will be very indiscriminate it will not only extend to groups that use violence it will expand to mainstream uighur society this is what weve seen in the past
4894134 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
4894135 wexler was cutting records as if they were short stories
4894136 he brought a depth of literature to a music that was basically treated as if it was primitive
4894137 a lot of conventions are primarily geared toward costumes and games it rules out the whole base of this stuff which is writing
4894138 ten years from now people will say holy cow he was the guest of honor
4894139 nothing is said nowadays that has not been said before terence 81
4894140 i cant hug a stranger when i win in singles
4894141 being able to share this with somebody somebody you like very much
4894142 we were expecting them to come out and hit everything being able to execute their strategies and keep us off balance so we wanted to take it to them and be physical with them
4894143 a little weird because we were playing for high stakes going against each other it was a little different than playing in practice
4894144 i was disappointed not surprised that we didnt do a better job than we did tonight
4894145 absolutely it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champion this was a big game for us
4894146 we were able to read the floor very well and get our hands on balls and steal and be aggressive
4894147 weve got to continue to do what we do best which is run execute our zone offense which is something we did very very well tonight and something that were going to need to improve on in the quarterfinals and the later rounds so thats what well stay focused on and offensive rebounding is obviously a big key as well
4894148 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
4894149 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
4894150 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
4894151 once i feel my kite flying nicely i rig up my camera on the line about 100 feet below the kite
4894152 sometimes the kite comes down but as the sail of the kite is big it parachutes or glides down slowly i have lost one camera dropping it in the yamuna river behind the taj mahal
4894153 i have shot thousands of pictures above india i love india its sounds smells colours people shooting india is so rewarding to my senses
4894154 i am shocked i dont know what happened i am always cautious with what i take in
4894155 bolt of lightning leaves the rest of mankind far behind
4894156 the greatest 100m performance in the history of the event
4894157 imagine what he might achieve if he broke into a trot
4894158 a human flying machine who is still a long way from reaching the extremity of his personal speed limit let alone mankinds
4894159 for 9 69 seconds this 6ft 5in 1 96m jamaican phenomenon had taken off and touched speeds no human had ever before reached without technological assistance he had done so while shutting down the engines some 20 metres from the line glancing to his right presumably in the ill founded notion that someone might be within his air space
4894160 he needs only 41 strides to reach the other end of the 100m track thats four or five less than the other world class sprinters
4894161 what was billed as a showdown thus ended in a walkover
4894162 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4894163 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4894164 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4894165 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
4894166 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
4894167 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
4894168 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4894169 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4894170 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4894171 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4894172 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4894173 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4894174 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4894175 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4894176 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4894177 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4894179 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4894180 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4894181 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4894182 taur figueiredo mostrar alguns conceitos importantes sobre desenvolvimento com o expression studio
4894183 com demonstra es pr ticas baseadas em necessidades do dia a dia do desenvolvedor
4894184 a gathering a few weeks ago for an aged southern sage
4894185 we havent been running that well the last few weeks we had a good run in the 250 at oxford plains speedway last month and this is the biggest race there is now hopefully we can have a good run in this 250 too
4894186 we just got run out wide by ripley and then when i tried to get back down i got spun
4894187 i just know that i went into turn 3 and 4 and before i knew it i was in the third groove it happened so quick i dont really know what happened
4894188 i just lost my first win im pretty sure we had it and i think the 70 car knew it and thats why he drove the way he did
4894189 orr accidentally run into the side of me under yellow and i cut a right front tire down
4894190 i think the guys dont want to run on the outside on these restarts
4894191 they want to back out of it and get in line behind me it makes me look like im jumping restarts which im not they just know we have a fast car and they dont want to run out there with us
4894192 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4894193 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4894194 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4894195 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4894196 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4894197 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4894198 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4894199 ive seen the success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars
4894200 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint ive seen him get the job done
4894201 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was he asked all the right questions
4894202 about how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships
4894203 i think that you have two very hard nosed territorial drivers that are smart and can earn points i think those two together will do exactly what that team needs
4894204 ryan is great at qualifying they are obviously going to need that they are both great at points racing i think it was a wise move on tonys behalf very stable environment over there very stable group of driver
4894205 i think it will be a good combination theyve both proved on the race track and in the garage area that theyre competitive guys and competitive drivers ryan is a heck of a qualifier and racer and so is tony
4894206 theyll both bring a lot of information to the table and theyll both bring a lot of good people i think theyll run really well
4894207 he got ryan to be his teammate thats good i think tony needs to have guys he knows that have own races before that helps the team
4894208 when youve won you have certain ideas for what you need at certain racetracks thats a good thing with ryan and tony they both have those feelings to be able to help each other
4894209 those two being teammates is no different than jimmie johnson and jeff gordon as teammates
4894210 i wish them both the best of luck but i think its going to take some time to build that organization to where tony wants to see it in a few years
4894211 id rather not see them struggle but realistically they got to build up their relationships with their crew chiefs whoever those guys are going to be
4894212 i just dont foresee putting a driver in that car and making it perform way better they are a little bit behind
4894213 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4894214 i had a difficult youth i experimented with drugs and drank i trace this to a certain selfishness on my point i couldnt focus on other people
4894215 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
4894216 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me
4894217 means im saved and forgiven our faith encompasses not just america but the world
4894218 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
4894219 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of the constitution
4894220 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4894221 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor
4894222 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
4894223 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
4894224 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
4894225 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
4894226 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
4894227 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4894228 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4894229 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4894230 i felt a pop in my foot i couldnt stand on it
4894231 i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon on a bus
4894232 i thought it was just tendons they get hyper sensitive leading up to marathon
4894233 i was icing it this week it didnt affect how i was training
4894234 we prepare forever for the marathon and i had a sound race plan
4894235 i was excited to get out i made my country proud and tried to win another medal as athletes we have ups and downs unfortunately you cant pick the days they come on
4894236 if it was a trap and theres good reason to think it was he walked right into it
4894237 a small number of people who were not part of the main group seemed intent on causing problems
4894238 i think our actions today have shown that we will not tolerate disorder of any kind in derbyshire
4894239 we will be continuing our inquiries to identify and trace those people who committed offences but were not arrested today
4894240 we regard them protesters as entitled to have their demonstration
4894241 its unfortunate that some of them want to try and cause trouble for us hence then the police had to inconvenience local people
4894242 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4894243 when i ran the earlier round i felt the world record because its a new track and its fast but i came out here just to win im so happy for myself and my country
4894244 me and my coach we decided that i can take both the 100m and 200m so i came here prepared and im going to try and do it
4894245 he could have run faster if he had wanted to
4894246 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4894247 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4894248 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4894249 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4894250 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4894251 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4894252 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4894253 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4894254 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4894255 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4894256 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4894257 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4894258 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4894259 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4894260 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4894261 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4894262 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4894263 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4894264 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4894265 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4894266 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4894267 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4894268 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4894269 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4894270 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4894271 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4894272 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4894273 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4894274 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4894275 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4894276 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4894295 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4894296 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4894297 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4894298 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4894299 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4894300 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4894301 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4894302 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4894303 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4894304 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4894305 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4894306 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4894307 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4894308 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4894309 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4894310 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education

4894314 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4894315 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4894316 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4894317 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4894318 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4894319 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4894320 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4894347 i put myself on the line but physically it wasnt there but at least i tried
4894348 usain bolt looks nailed on for me looks like he could break the world record carrying a drinks tray in a waiters race

4894355 if asafa powell is to have any chance of winning he will have to take a metre or so out of usain bolt at the start

4894367 that was very very tough its very difficult to put how i feel into words its been such a tough five months
4894368 i was too soft in the middle and ive got four years to work on that i knew we had an extra gear but i didnt believe we could do it like that ive never been in so much pain in all my life
4894369 im pleased for olaf tufte winning the gold in the mens single sculls but id like sir steve to be stripped of his knighthood for the traitorous act of inviting tuft round for tea and giving him training tips
4894370 we knew it was going to be a good race were very disappointed not to get the gold but you can never pass up an olympic medal

4894381 why am i thinking this im watching the sailing and all i can think of is the guy who comes out of the sea in jason and the argonauts has the lack of sleep this week made me delirious
4894382 if he wins seven golds and ties what i did then it would be like i was the first man on the moon and he became the second if he wins more than seven then he becomes the first man on mars

4894386 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4894387 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4894388 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4894389 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee
4894390 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4894391 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4894392 this is a planning took where all things are going
4894393 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4894394 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4894395 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4894396 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4894397 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

4894405 meh instead of a technical network like that where everyones living in fear of being shut down id rather a more logical social network where people can get this create free music under cc similar licenses and let other people actually listen to it
4894406 what if im the owner of an internet radio station that plays only music that has become public domain through the consent of the owner or the expiration of copyrights or perhaps i only like to play songs by artists who sell their cds for less than the industry standard say 5 a cd will my fees be lessened

4894417 connecting the past present and future with a kite string
4894418 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4894419 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4894420 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4894421 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4894422 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4894423 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4894424 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4894425 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4894426 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4894427 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4894428 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4894429 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4894430 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4894431 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4894432 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4894433 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4894434 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4894435 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4894436 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4894437 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4894438 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4894439 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4894440 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4894441 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4894442 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4894443 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4894444 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4894445 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4894446 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4894447 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4894448 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4894449 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4894450 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4894451 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4894452 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4894453 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4894454 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4894455 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4894456 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4894457 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4894458 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4894459 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4894460 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4894461 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4894462 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4894463 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4894464 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4894465 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4894466 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4894467 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4894468 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4894469 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4894470 i picked a couple of new ideas lets hope i can now surf ha ha
4894471 content is very useful and great to have a local product
4894472 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4894473 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4894474 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4894475 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4894476 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4894477 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4894478 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4894479 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4894480 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4894481 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4894482 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4894483 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4894484 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4894485 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4894486 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4894487 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4894488 but after a few months i relented we moved in together still even then every day he would present me with a gift the daily gifts became like a joke
4894489 how could you be angry to receive a gift every day
4894490 when i was in college i wanted to be a professional actress i spent more time going to auditions than i did going to class at one point i got an actual callback for a major movie role it was the kind of role i would have quit school altogether for i was ecstatic
4894491 i had been dating john for a few weeks we spent the night before my audition together i made it clear that i was nervous and superstitious and needed a real nights sleep
4894492 he told me he had a gift for good luck i said ok he told me to close my eyes and then he started kissing my neck
4894493 then he started nibbling and sucking i should have figured out what was going on but it had never happened to me before by the time i pulled away he had already given me a big purple hickey it was right above my collarbone on the left side
4894494 i was so mad i had been planning to wear a sky blue shirt with a deep v neck
4894495 i looked great in it but i had to switch plans and wear a turtleneck instead the turtleneck made me look pretentious and prudish i still think it sabotaged my audition
4894496 who knows i refused to see him the next day but he left a gift in my mailbox it was a silk scarf the next day he left me a necktie the day after that a cashmere turtleneck you get the idea
4894497 i stayed mad for a while but i actually wore the gifts he sent if nothing else they helped cover up the bruise
4894498 about a week later i saw him on campus and we made up we actually lived together for two years
4894499 i could wear a different thing around my neck every day for a year

4894502 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4894503 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4894504 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4894505 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension

4894509 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4894510 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4894511 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple

4894522 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4894523 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha

4894921 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4894922 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget

4894939 the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles

4894941 it had not been turned into an official ideology and is thus the object karl
4894942 the nature of individuals depends on the material conditions determining their production
4894943 there are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented by marxists and anti marxists alike
4894944 between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat
4894945 that anyone who uses jews as the yardstick of evil is being antisemitic
4894946 those critics who see this as a foretaste of mein kampf overlook one essential point in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping the essay was actually written as a defence of the jews it was a retort to bruno bauer who had argued that jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as christians

4894950 if that is marxism then i am not a marxist
4894951 marx never attempts to provide an answer indeed he cannot since if he attributes the state of technology or technological change to the actions of man of individual men his whole system falls apart for human consciousness and individual consciousness at that would then be determining the mode of production rather than the other way round

4894958 doling money out like he was printing it in the basement
4894959 at one time you couldnt walk through the pits and not see a torco sticker on a race car
4894960 he had two top fuel teams and a funny car team in the nhra national hot rod association
4894961 those are 2 to 3 million apiece plus a funny car team in the ihra international hot rod association
4894962 its a sad thing because at heart evan knoll was a drag racing fan he just wanted to be one of the guys
4894963 i think its important that this guy doesnt come off as some kind of venal crook he just wanted to be with the popular kids
4894964 i didnt know how much was he was spending on racing id heard figures of 12 million to 21 million a year
4894965 yeah it was a lot but i dont know how much
4894966 he went from a zero to a hero and a rock star
4894967 bought race teams like youd buy clocks at a garage sale
4894968 i could never figure out where all the money was coming from
4894969 such a friendly low key amicable person you almost couldnt resist him
4894970 in racing its a tough business and when somebodys willing to spend money in this industry people lean on that
4894971 but at one point when teams werent getting their money racers were literally staying in motels and in motor homes in decatur waiting for their checks
4894972 torco was sponsoring so many teams that at some events the first four pairs of cars that raced were torco cars racing against each other

4894976 pisces doesnt mind not being a millionaire but wouldnt mind living like one
4894977 we are all under 18 we all have been here for more than a year
4894978 we have juveniles from 14 to 18 theyre ied makers they are dangerous people
4894979 i swear to god some were just walking in the streets or sleeping and they brought us here i swear to god we are all innocent
4894980 and he is the most dangerous we know about him
4894981 five months they wanted to take my father i told them take me instead
4894982 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4894983 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
4894984 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4894985 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4894986 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4894987 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4894988 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4894989 this kind of officially ends fall camp with the scrimmage today and we certainly have room for improvement
4894990 that is certainly what we focus on the good news is we made some big plays on offense today john parker wilson was pretty precise with the ball he did not have any interceptions and we did not turn it over we probably did not have the consistency that we need play in and play out to be a good offensive team
4894991 julio jones had five catches for about 125 yards he made a big play had four catches so we spread the ball around a little bit more today we were a little more effective throwing it
4894992 all in all were not disappointed with where we are
4894993 we certainly need to continue to make improvement as a football team especially with a lot of young players and the depth we have on our football team
4894994 there was a huge difference in some of the young players this week and last week donta hightower played really well in this scrimmage and made a big improvement jerell harris has improved the young receivers have improved has done a good job he didnt make any big runs today but is still pretty effective out there we have a couple of young offensive linemen we continue to work with is a new and that has made an impact in the middle we need to continue to work on his conditioning so he can sustain things has done some good things
4894995 it can be done but perhaps there is a better way
4894996 you bet im the one to get this done just like you described
4894997 ok now what if the persons language reads right to left
4894998 clark kent reached the highest height with the help of perry white
4894999 and thats when i came to the sudden realization that

4895006 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4895007 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4895008 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4895009 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee
4895010 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4895011 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4895012 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4895013 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4895014 equally citizens are entitled to expect reasonable behaviour from our police so lets wait and see before we jump to any conclusions
4895015 outdid all of its predecessors in numbers colour noise and expense
4895016 no country ever has or surely will match the chinese in effort human power synchronicity ingenuity and it has to be said money they were willing to put into what was once a little show
4895017 we de emphasize the foundation data in our own business model as a reinforcement of this message that we want to get out there foundation giving is very important and it has a place in every nonprofits fundraising plan but the scope of the investment into foundation giving needs to be proportionate to where the money comes from nationally
4895018 million dollar donations are the result of years and years of cultivation and strengthening relationships
4895019 when i read that internet search engines generated close to 6 billion in advertising
4895020 i thought to myself what if even a fraction of that money could go toward good causes
4895021 its really an effortless way for people to support their favorite charity or school
4895022 one that does not require a lot of extra effort to gain a positive benefit
4895023 next year fsma will fund over 5 million in research
4895024 and supporters know each time they search on the internet they are doing something to help faan
4895025 in a world where funding for nonprofits is becoming more difficult to secure
4895026 programs like goodsearch are helping make a difference across a broad range of organizations who are trying to help others
4895027 google grants recipients use their award of free adwords advertising on google to achieve various goals whether its to raise awareness about an issue increase web traffic or reach new donors or potential volunteers
4895028 we provide grantees with a model for a successful campaign upon their start in the program
4895029 and provide grantees with the tools to monitor and evaluate their campaign performance so they can make ongoing adjustments and updates
4895030 since our primary users are children with the greatest needs this grant has proven to be invaluable in that it has helped many more parents and teachers find us
4895031 google seems to measure results more than anything else so a small grassroots organization can compete with larger better funded efforts
4895032 their team actually must have played with our lessons before suggesting words for our ad campaign
4895033 because the keywords they suggested learn to read and so on were spot on
4895034 darling honestly if you didnt know me what age would you say i am
4895035 judging from your skin twenty your hair eighteen and your figure twenty five
4895036 our new integrated database system will make it possible for us to gather and manage data about our clients more quickly
4895037 our new database system will make it possible for us to better gather and analyze information about our clients this will result in us being able to better serve them
4895038 understanding our clients means we can better serve them with the care and medications they need when they need them most to augment our personal contact and knowledge of our clients a new database will make it possible for us to better analyze data about them and trends in our service delivery approaches this means better service to individual clients and improvements in our overall patient care system
4895039 in our strategic goals for 2003 we will develop and support advisory boards of our constituents
4895040 because our constituents are spread out over a large geographic are an extranet will allow us to effectively and efficiently communicate with our advisors and board in addition the extranet is part of an overall communications strategy to improve our record keeping and decision making process
4895041 we rely upon our advisors to help us stay in contact with and better understand the community we serve we have always strived and struggled to gather their input to guide our programming in our strategic goals for 2003 we clarify that this is an area where there needs to be a lot of improvement we will respond to this reality by formally developing and supporting two new advisory boards of our constituents in the past this communication was ad hoc and anecdotal with community advisors we want to develop a systematic approach that will let us track how the communitys needs change over time this will help us document our growth and better anticipate future needs because our constituents are spread out over a large geographic are a better communications system extranet will allow us to effectively and efficiently reach out to and hear from our advisors and board in addition the extranet is part of an overall communications strategy to improve our record keeping and decision making process
4895042 as consumer watchdogs staying in more regular and timely contact with our partners means we can respond together with a unified and strong voice to proposals announced by the mayors office
4895043 we understand and expect to see described that technology is an integral part not just of programs but that the cost in staff hours or the cost of not having that tool can make a huge difference in the organizations overall financial health
4895044 an environmental nonprofit in florida made the case that arming its senior staff with cell phones made sense because they were spending so much time stuck in south florida traffic this was costing the organization a fortune in down time and hurt their ability to respond to constituent and press calls from wherever they were and they ended up getting their cell phone system funding
4895045 weve learned from working with other organizations on joint projects that a database project of this scope is expensive and challenging therefore we are breaking the project into six specific manageable stages we will further reduce risk by using feedback mechanisms built into each stage a detailed description of our implementation plan with timelines and benchmarks is attached
4895046 i understand what you do for us everyday i am an admirer of your organization some of you are like full time employees
4895047 it probably started as something not so good but it has evolved into something that is very good
4895048 a sheriffs gift of an honorary badge to a private citizen violates california law if 1 the badge falsely purports to be authorized or would deceive an ordinary reasonable person into believing that it is authorized for use by a peace officer
4895049 as a law enforcement agency we shouldnt be looking for loopholes
4895050 i follow the law and i apply the law fairly
4895051 its not the badge its your identification with the department that gives you the respect of the public
4895052 a charity badge allows individual people to be the fundraisers for the organization
4895053 to me its really exciting because you can raise more
4895054 as long as you have the basic strategy in place start with a low risk experiment with a smaller goal
4895055 outreach via the internet is already a fundamental course of action that saving shelter pets uses for its fundraising
4895056 so this effort is a natural extension of what we do anyway
4895057 we specifically asked our supporters to help saving shelter pets by promoting the badge with their family and friends
4895058 and we gave them the html code to make it easy for them to do so
4895059 in our experience we have found that the network opportunity on myspace is fabulous
4895060 we have heard from a number of myspace friends that they have posted the saving shelter pets badge and contest info on their web sites and their myspace pages
4895061 we would never dream of making a grant to an organization that has no mailing address or telephone number having a space and a phone is just a part of the cost of doing business likewise we have to think about technology in the same vein and support is a regular cost of doing business
4895062 if were going to fund technology for an organization not only do we need to know that they know what they need and can make good use of it we also need to see plans for how the continuous upgrade and continuous training pieces are integrated into the operating budget of the organization most funders that fund the start up programs want to see the long term plan for this program being integrated into the organizations core because we cant fund core operations or programs in perpetuity this is not an easy thing to do and i dont mean to suggest that it is something that can be automatic but i think that this is an additional piece of thinking that nonprofits have to do and a case they have to make with their own boards around resource allocation if funders see nonprofits undertaking those tough decisions then i think we have greater insurance that our investment is well spent
4895063 frankly for my board any indication that there are multiple supporters for an investment makes it more compelling
4895064 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple

4895074 extending asjha to a long term contract makes good business sense
4895075 trading for her in 2004 was based in part on her potential as an athlete and which has no doubt paid great dividends keeping asjha here was a top priority for us and we are very pleased with this new contract

4895080 mac always said that was the junker blues junker being the old term for junkie

4895083 i was married to an actress willi burke at the time and she was embarrassed by it all cause all her friends were theater people
4895084 ya never knew what the hell they were talkin about the people were crossover guys like muddy waters who i eventually liked
4895085 most of the black guys that sing with a rasp have a voice thats been misused form early life from drinking and smoking since they were nine my contention is that it comes from misusing the voice not knowing anything about proper vocal techniques so you get a white guy who has no reason for this his speaking voice is clear and he suddenly affects a rasp
4895086 they must practice all day in college there are black guys with very nice speaking voices like b b king who dont sing with a rasp joe turners singing the blues for 50 years he dont have a raspy voice he could have been an opera singer

4895091 we think the pleasant state that can be induced by music leads to special physiological changes which eventually lead to stress reduction or direct immune enhancement
4895092 stress reduction probably plays an important role but the stress reducing effect seems to be different for various types of music
4895093 wed expect that different kinds of music might show different physiological and immunological effects
4895094 listening to music in hospitals might show benefits for patients and may for example lead to shorter recovery times but we are still to test this ourselves
4895095 used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
4895096 the footage aired by the british tv channel was preceded with a picture of a road sign displaying the name of the town gori written in georgian and english languages the report also said that a sky news correspondent was reporting from the georgian town
4895097 what became the picture that mike jeremy of itn pegged one of the key images of the war in the former yugoslavia qtd in deichmann p 170 was in fact presented as to the western world as something it was not a concentration camp the focus was on fikret alic whos protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of nazi death camps this death camp was a crude sick lie and fikret alic who survived the war was disturbed about the use of his image

4895100 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorizes its experiences
4895101 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4895102 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviors that we see in whole organisms
4895103 this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviors but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons

4895106 in this one and only church of god from its very beginnings there arose certain rifts which the apostle strongly censures as damnable but in subsequent centuries much more serious dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from full communion with the catholic church for which often enough men of both sides were to blame
4895107 however one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into these communities that resulted from such separation and in them are brought up in the faith of christ and the catholic church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers all who have been justified by faith in baptism are incorporated into christ they therefore have a right to be called christians and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the lord by the children of the catholic church
4895108 the written word of god the life of grace faith hope and charity with the other interior gifts of the holy spirit as well as visible elements
4895109 christ bestowed unity on his church from the beginning this unity we believe subsists in the catholic church as something she can never lose and we hope that it will continue to increase until the end of time
4895110 that they may all be one as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be one in us so that the world may know that you have sent me
4895111 that this holy objective the reconciliation of all christians in the unity of the one and only church of christ transcends human powers and gifts
4895112 in the prayer of christ for the church in the love of the father for us and in the power of the holy spirit
4895113 this is an official source of the doctrines of the catholic church so if what you as a protestant may have been taught seems different than this it was taught to you in error if what you have read even from popular catholic authors seems different from this then either that author was wrong or you misunderstood them if this seems different from what you have read in the catechism of the council of trent or some other official source of the catholic church from the past then i am willing to bet you misunderstood them because this is not a change in the position of the catholic church
4895114 would you people shut up im trying to watch the movie

4895127 none they will all fly away with the first gunshot
4895128 the correct answer is three but i like your thinking
4895129 three women are sitting on a bench one is licking her ice cream the second is feeding pigeons and the third is working on her laptop which one is married
4895130 the correct answer is the one with the wedding ring on her finger but i like your thinking

4895133 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4895134 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4895135 any serious approach to community building must devise ways to reroot business to insert locality into the equations by which businesses make decisions
4895136 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4895137 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states

4895142 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4895143 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4895144 i was talking to some of the national guys who make the rounds and they were talking about what happens when you go to a zone blocking scheme and generally those offensive lines dont really start getting better until the second half of the year if not the second season because it takes a while to learn the system
4895145 any public prosecutor who sees his or her duty as being to secure convictions misses the point as ministers of justice public prosecutors must place before the court all evidence whether it supports his or her case or whether it weakens it and supports the case for the accused
4895146 the courts must now vigorously enforce and enforce against the state the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual guaranteed by the constitution those rights cannot and must not be allowed to be diluted by allowing the state to claim reciprocal privileges the state is the usual and obvious violator against whom protection is provided in the constitution and it ought not to be allowed to claim the same privileges

4895157 during the meeting with me the president spoke his mind that he is not considering the option to resign
4895158 the president has been told that being constitutional bodies both the supreme court as well as the parliament cannot interfere in each others affairs and the apex court cannot impede the latter from impeaching him
4895159 we have already finalised the place where the members of parliament would hold the session if the president took an extreme step of using his powers to dissolve the assembly under article 58 2 b
4895160 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan and met senior government officials

4895178 no mention was made about what happened on august 8 when western leaders fell silent while tskhinvali was shelled and bombed

4895190 we made it abundantly clear that we did not buy the propaganda being sold in the pre consultation and consultation booklets
4895191 we expressed grave concern for a public that did not have our first hand knowledge of what the true environmental and socio economic impacts were the hydro teams typical response was to simply move on to the next agenda item or to the next question
4895192 the main reasons for not building this dam are the same as they were in the 1980s
4895193 1 an acceptable forecast demonstrates that construction must begin immediately in order to avoid supply deficiencies and 2 a comparison of alternate feasible plans demonstrates that site c is the best project to meet the anticipated supply deficiency
4895194 this pretense of its necessary for self sufficiency is based on some pretty creative analysis and accounting
4895195 what the site c folks and even the anti site c folks havent really framed is that with the columbia basin treaty weve got this massive amount of energy that we have contractually agreed should be brought to the border and instead of actually bringing that energy into british columbia the government consistently chooses to sell that into the california market and book the revenue
4895196 as a decision on whether to proceed to build site c is still a few years away any project cost estimates right now are only interim
4895197 i think its fair to say that as with previous estimates that have been published we havent done all the engineering work youd need to do one of the things we need to do in the next while is get a much clearer view of what the costs would be
4895198 when you look at large hydro projects they typically have what looks to be a large up front investment but then they have low operating costs and they have very long term benefits
4895199 if you went back in time to when the previous large hydro projects were built youd see what at the time were very large capital sums and youd agree i think now that those turned out to be very wise investments
4895200 there obviously are environmental impacts from large hydro projects but there are also environmental impacts from every other alternative
4895201 when you look at the b c governments energy plan look at the requirement for 90 per cent generation from clean sources this clearly we believe falls within that and seems very consistent
4895202 id say were starting to get closer to the real truth about the actual cost of site c the probability of it increasing is much greater than of decreasing
4895203 now that a more accurate figure is out there perhaps the real debate over the desirability of site c can begin
4895204 the in service day of site c is still a long way away but you have to have a fairly accurate cost number before you invest the hundreds of millions of dollars required just to move the project forward
4895205 if it does proceed i can tell you it will be part of bc hydros heritage assets and kept in public hands
4895206 hey i never go out and i havent seen this friend in a while and she is always asking me to hang out
4895207 i hate to do this in a text message but i dont think this is working out
4895208 nah i think im gonna play play dough a lil bit
4895209 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4895210 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4895211 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4895212 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4895213 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4895214 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4895215 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4895216 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4895217 there were some feelings i have not felt in a while but i was excited
4895218 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the five franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4895219 ich habe sie gegen real madrid beobachtet frankfurt hat ein sehr gutes team
4895220 this is my first title defense and i am preparing as good as ever i have ownership of this title and cherry will know it and feel it when he steps into the ring with me
4895221 im aware that cherry is a dangerous opponent that likes to come forward but i know how to deal with it his fighting style and how i handle my business in the ring will make it a very exciting fight
4895222 there is one thing for certain no matter what my belts not going anywhere its staying with me
4895223 the treadmill is cool but jogging is better than using the machine

4895228 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
4895229 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4895230 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan
4895231 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4895232 tradition is the living faith of the dead traditionalism is the dead faith of the living
4895233 what more did you want i sent you 2 boats
4895234 this trip has reinforced my po sition on the need for a renewed focus on the nations arctic do main and the coast guards capa bility and capacity to meet our sovereign and statutory responsi bilities for the safety and security of that domain
4895235 we are moving for ward responsibly and deliberately to ensure that the coast guard is prepared to effectively execute and efficiently support our critical missions in this increasingly im portant region in the future
4895236 this collaboration will assist both countries in defining the con tinental shelf in the arctic ocean it will also save millions of dollars for both countries provide data of great interest to both countries and increase scientific and diplo matic cooperation
4895237 operating ca pabilities of small boats heli copters fixed wing aircraft and their requisite command and con trol are limited by the unpre dictable rapidly changing and often harsh weather including drifting ice and frequently re duced visibility of the arctic envi ronment we also have a greater awareness and sensitivity to the logistical challenges in terms of limited infrastructure and the fi nite availability of lodging and food services
4895238 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4895239 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4895240 it was getting pretty close i always had underlying optimism that sanity was going to prevail but i was beginning to wonder
4895241 this is a direct result of lobbying pressure so if anyone thinks their call didnt matter it did thats why this is happening
4895242 no one thought those per station fees were remotely rational it only makes sense that theyre being taken off the table
4895243 and last but not least the public looking over congresss shoulder
4895244 in consultation with government we have now decided to postpone this release and will be doing further work to ensure that this plan meets the needs of ratepayers
4895245 what i find really bizarre is that it flies in the face of the liberal mantra maintained all through the public debate about the sale of terasen gas and the controversy about the cn railroad and all kinds of stuff that it was not their intention to manipulate public processes or commissions or crown corporations
4895246 my tape cannon is blowing up your kleenex box tank

4895255 i had a difficult youth i experimented with drugs and drank i trace this to a certain selfishness on my point i couldnt focus on other people
4895256 he has just got a tight back and that was referring pain into his hamstrings
4895257 well it was a bit of a no not really no
4895258 the grounds patchy but it will hold up for the game
4895259 i did the best i could despite the result i tried my hardest
4895260 i cant believe it is already the middle of august
4895261 i dont mind the shorter summer considering the run we made
4895262 there are some advantages too you dont have as long to get out of shape and you dont have to work as hard to get back into shape for camp so thats nice but the bottom line is that we all want to get back there and play deep into the playoffs again it was a good experience for all of us that will be invaluable for us next spring when hopefully we get back to the playoffs we have a lot of work to do to get back there but as well as we performed we are looking forward to getting back there and it is something all of us are shooting for it obviously left us with a desire to get back there as soon as possible
4895263 we usually start training hard about five or six weeks prior to camp
4895264 thats when the pace gets picked up during the summer you try to maintain and keep your strength up and you want to feel healthy but then you kick it back in gear when camp start to approach were right at that point now and most of the guys will start skating hard this week if they havent already
4895265 i dont think anything has changed or will change for me from the playoff run
4895266 my confidence might be one thing that gets a lift from the strides we made i was always confident in my role on the team and this spring probably helped strengthen that even more it probably goes back to the vancouver series two playoffs ago the first season as captain was a tough one with the injuries and adjusting to wearing the c but i felt very comfortable when i came back late in the year and in the playoffs
4895267 i dont think theres a day that goes by that she isnt in the water she loves it
4895268 it is exciting to get back out on the ice
4895269 coming off a successful run like we had all of us are excited to get back to work and get back on the track we were on

4895284 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4895285 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4895286 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4895287 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4895288 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4895289 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4895290 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4895291 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4895292 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4895293 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4895294 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4895295 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4895296 it is really unfortunate that russia chooses to react by putting nuclear warheads in different places if indeed it does that when the rest of the world is not looking at some kind of old fashioned superpower conflict

4895302 its a magical moment something incredible in my career and i enjoy that
4895303 since then i cant stop thinking that if i am the best player in the world i should do the same in the olympics and then finally i made it it is really special also because it is for switzerland you know our country cannot get so many medals at one olympics maybe one or two but this time i got a gold medal it is for my country i really feel different it is for my country and it is different from the grand slam where i did it for just myself

4895308 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4895309 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4895310 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4895311 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

4895315 there wont be any reason to change anything at this meeting
4895316 i doubt a second stimulus package is going to happen but its rarely prudent to overestimate the wisdom or fiscal prudence of politicians during an election year
4895317 if its going to happen it must happen in september
4895318 thats why theyre reigning premiers and they have lost only one game this year
4895319 theres no question they are a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin
4895320 i think if they play their best theres no one who will beat them
4895321 a little while ago we would have really nerved up and panicked up if we didnt have matthew scarlett playing in the team
4895322 we are more relaxed and people fill a role and cover for him
4895323 in the last quarter i think we probably put our cues in the rack a little bit and didnt really play the best footy but it really didnt matter
4895324 it was all about just getting through to next week really now
4895325 i just know that on any given day we can be beaten
4895326 its more than just skill you need a lot of luck
4895327 but were a good side when we play well i agree with that part
4895328 they are fighting for a top four spot so that will be a very competitive game and we couldnt ask for a better one
4895329 as soon as you take your foot off the pedal the game can really turn around and bite you
4895330 we wont be flirting with our form we wont be trying new things
4895331 we are just going to keep playing the next two weeks like we have been playing and that should give us a good ride into the finals
4895332 if you put yourself out there youre going to be a lightning rod
4895333 people out there who are too dangerous to be incarcerated
4895334 i believe in helping folks through judicious use of government but not burdening them with crushing economic pressure
4895335 as a civil rights attorney i am inherently suspicious of government power because i have seen it abused
4895336 but i believe it is absolutely essential to have effective government to help people achieve their maximum freedom
4895337 personally i like him a lot i just disagree with much of his agenda

4895343 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
4895344 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
4895345 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
4895346 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
4895347 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
4895348 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help
4895349 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
4895350 there are a small number of professionals like school teachers and nurses but its more of an open set up its difficult to find a girlfriend in this town and keep her
4895351 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa

4895353 la verdad es que ya le hab a ganado pero no te s decir si fue intencional o no ya me abri y pues ya son dos puntadas que me hicieron por dentro y que me taparon por fuera
4895354 yo digo que s el rbitro dice que no fue se empat el partido y hay que seguir trabajando
4895355 la verdad no s si se vaya a presentar una queja nada m s me tomaron fotos y ya no supe qu pas me quise parar y por el dolor no me par me toqu la cara y ten a mucha sangre y por eso no me levant creo que es parte del futbol
4895356 ejecut mal nada m s ejecut con el tobillo no alcanc a darle con parte interna y sali lo que todos vieron vol el bal n por encima del larguero desde el rea chica
4895357 me dijo que fuera con la misma confianza que me ha visto y por la cual estoy ac que dejara eso atr s que son experiencias desafortunadamente malas que suceden en el futbol hoy me toc y hay que dejarlo afuera
4895358 es una buena oportunidad para m de seguir en el equipo hay que seguir luchando por el puesto
4895359 yo creo que no hemos hecho lo suficiente aun cuando hoy pagamos muy caro no la conformidad sino el mal manejo del juego que hicimos
4895360 no es un problema f sico es m s bien un manejo de juego que no ha sido bueno la verdad es que han sido justos los resultados tomando en cuenta lo que dejamos de hacer y lo que el rival hizo que tambi n tiene forzosamente su m rito
4895361 no manejamos bien el juego quisimos en cada jugada ir a matar y en ese ir a matar se recuperaban y sacaban el pelotazo largo y nos creaban problemas pero es manejo de juego por supuesto que un equipo que est con 10 jugadores corre al 110 por ciento por esa ausencia y el equipo que tiene 11 jugadores deja de correr pensando que tiene una ventaja
4895362 no es bueno para la imagen que todos los partidos nos expulsen a alguien
4895363 pachuca es un equipo ordenado que tiene mucho tiempo que trabaja el primer tiempo creo que fue muy parejo me parece que cambi despu s de la expulsi n nosotros apretamos y nos vamos a buscar el empate no digo que estoy 100 por ciento satisfecho pero el resultado me parece justo
4895364 me parece que a ning n entrenador le gusta ni le hace bien al equipo terminar con 10 todos los partidos estamos hablando estamos charlando de eso con los jugadores pero son ellos los que entran a la cancha y seguramente vamos a mejorar eso porque no es bueno para la imagen del club que todos los partidos nos expulsen a alguien
4895365 lo hemos trabajado mucho y no hemos tenido ning n tipo de inconveniente en lo que son c rner y pelotas paradas hoy fue una virtud de gim nez que sabemos que le pega muy bien a la pelota hizo un lindo gol pero nosotros para mi punto de vista hemos mejorado mucho en pelota parada hoy no nos han complicado un equipo que cabecea muy bien as que vamos a seguir trabajando vamos a seguir mejorando hay mucho camino por recorrer y el equipo tiene que ir mejor
4895366 uno siempre trata de dar lo mejor y poner lo mejor para el equipo estoy contento con lo que hice con lo que hago y vamos a continuar

4895369 no hay excesos de confianza al contrario los resultados que hemos tenido indican que vamos a hacer las cosas muy bien si vamos ganado vamos a cuidar ese resultado a muerte estamos en una situaci n que no le gusta a nadie pero el futbol es as vamos a trabajar en la semana corregir errores y buscar la revancha el fin de semana

4895389 it was important to win the game we were a bit nervous especially as they played well with the long ball and it was not easy for us

4895405 i found that kids from the wealthiest families had the highest rates of anxiety and depression and substance abuse more than poor children
4895406 i concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable
4895407 the fact that you have now questioned my sincerity is regrettable but does not in any way diminish my deep respect for you nor my willingness to find a bipartisan solution to this problem
4895408 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
4895409 one of the aspects about this institution that i have come to value most is the collegiality and the willingness to put aside partisan differences to work on issues that help the american people it was in this spirit that i approached you to work on ethics reform and it was in this spirit that i agreed to attend your bipartisan meeting last week
4895410 i like him hes probably got a great future we can do some work together
4895411 please be assured i wont make the same mistake again
4895412 there was a little bit of grandstanding there by obama that made it difficult to get a bipartisan effort
4895413 this idea that as president hes going to be able to reach across the aisle theres very thin gruel that would indicate that
4895414 senator obama has every right to tout his role in that legislation
4895415 he wasnt showboating he was trying to get things done
4895416 somewhere along the line the straight talk express lost some wheels
4895417 he really doesnt have any accomplishments its not a slight against obama hes only been in the senate for a few years and most of that time he was running for president
4895418 maybe there was a little bit of pettiness on the other side
4895419 hes sending you a press release letter for his leader
4895420 he told me to brush him back you dont do things like that
4895421 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me were sincere

4895498 the grounds patchy but it will hold up for the game
4895499 thats why theyre reigning premiers and they have lost only one game this year
4895500 theres no question they are a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin
4895501 i think if they play their best theres no one who will beat them
4895502 a little while ago we would have really nerved up and panicked up if we didnt have matthew scarlett playing in the team
4895503 we are more relaxed and people fill a role and cover for him
4895504 in the last quarter i think we probably put our cues in the rack a little bit and didnt really play the best footy but it really didnt matter

4895572 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant

4895618 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4895619 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4895620 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
4895621 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
4895622 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
4895623 it doesnt look good to say we need more oil but then export the refined products that youre getting it doesnt seem to be consistent
4895624 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets
4895625 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined

4895627 in zimbabwe the regrettable events leading to and including the holding of the run off elections on 27th june 2008 have no doubt left a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region

4895649 ia berkata maka isterinya pun hamil mengandung anaknya lalu anak itu ia beri nama abdullah lalu rasulullah saw bersabda segala puji bagi allah yang menjadikan dalam umatku orang yang memiliki kesabaran seperti kesabaran seorang wanita dari bani israil kepada beliau ditanyakan bagaiman beritanya wahai rasulullah beliau bersabda dalam bani israil terdapat wanita bersuami yang memiliki dua anak suaminya memerintahkannya menyediakan makanan untuk orang orang yang ia undang para undangan berkumpul di rumahnya ketika itu kedua anaknya keluar untuk bermain tiba tiba mereka terjatuh ke dalam sumur dekat rumahnya sang isteri tidak hendak mengganggu suaminya bersama para tamunya maka keduanya ia masukkan ke dalam rumah dan ditutupinya dengan pakaian ketika para undangan sudah pulang sang suami masuk seraya bertanya di mana anak anakku isterinya menjawab di dalam rumah ia lalu mengenakan minyak wangi dan menawarkan diri kepada suaminya sehingga mereka melakukan jima sang suami kembali bertanya di mana anak anakku di dalam rumah jawab isterinya lalu sang ayah memanggil kedua anaknya tiba tiba mereka keluar memenuhi panggilan sang isteri terperanjat subhanallah mahasuci allah demi allah keduanya telah meninggal dunia tetapi allah menghidupkannya kembali sebagi balasan dari kesabaranku

4895657 ketika sedang bersama rasulullah kami mendengar sesuatu jatuh maka beliau bersabda tahukah kalian suara apa itu kami menjawab allah dan rasulnya lebih tahu beliau bersabda itu adalah suara batu yang dilemparkan ke neraka semenjak 70 tahun yang lalu dan ia sekarang masih meluncur ke dasar neraka

4895676 the substitutes specify which schools they would like to work at
4895677 just because there are 841 substitutes that doesnt mean they are willing to come to creekside if they live in vanceboro but weve never had to venture outside the core pool of people weve come to know here at creekside
4895678 but you can tell when there are workshops going on
4895679 it becomes a little bit more difficult to find one
4895680 with all of those requirements in place were going to have some teachers out of the classroom
4895681 it is the boards expectation for a teacher to be in the classroom every day because it does impact student achievement
4895682 excessive absences can lead to a teacher not being employed much longer in craven county
4895683 its an expectation for our teachers that business can carry on as much normal as usual
4895684 we always tell them to make sure they overplan for the substitutes just so theres no idle time for the students
4895685 we love when we can place fully licensed substitutes in a classroom
4895686 we are fortunate that we have many retired teachers who come back under contract one year at a time they know curriculum and they know craven county if it werent for our retired teachers wed be in a very difficult situation
4895687 we got to do a lot of things out of town this year in jacksonville and raleigh
4895688 its been kind of like getting to work and take a vacation at one time all with the kids
4895689 theyre good but all youve got to do is make dance moves to miss the ball there aint nothing to it
4895690 were trying to be proactive to give them something to do while theyre out of school so they dont stay out in the streets
4895691 if we stay with them until ninth grade that would be my focus
4895692 and it gives them something to do in the summer when otherwise they may have nowhere to go
4895693 its definitely not a bad way to get your foot in the door
4895694 but its also a good way of finding out if its something you want to do sometimes people find they cant handle 25 to 30 kids in the classroom or they find out they would rather teach elementary school or high school
4895695 good dependable substitutes are hard to find you have to be patient to be a sub disciplined instruction they go together
4895696 if youve got a good one i think the class is in good shape
4895697 this is not just an ordinary job because you have the lives of others in your hands we try to encourage them to have a heart and love for the kids thats what its all about for full time teachers and for substitutes
4895698 his boat is typical of one thats been in storage
4895699 its out of date things corrode and quit working its important to work on boats and check them over when you take them out of storage
4895700 these guys are right about what i need to fix
4895701 anybody out on the water needs to follow instructions from the federal government and coast guard as long as they do that instead of flying like a bat out of torment everyone will be all right if my boat works i may be slam to ocracoke by this afternoon
4895702 others said they keep their registration at home its like a car and they need to keep the registration on board
4895703 the inspection wont necessarily keep the coast guard from stopping you
4895704 but if they do youll now be prepared to meet their rules and regulations and prepared to be safe on the water
4895705 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent

4895721 what began 20 months ago as a joint rcmp victoria police investigation into the sale of b c marijuana in the u s has ballooned into a massive police probe that reaches into the highest ranks of the provincial liberal party
4895722 as a result of our drug investigation into organized crime other information came to light and another investigation was begun
4895723 a decade of political experience inside both the b c liberal party and the liberal party of canada
4895724 ive been made aware of the concerns that these circumstances have raised i dont fully understand all the issues and at this time i am simply trying to collect further information that i will be discussing with our advisers
4895725 it will take several months to develop before the entire file is presented to the special prosecutor
4895726 are sad for rob and his family he was well regarded here
4895727 theres also some realization that the department was able to deal with it properly when it came to our attention
4895728 the police act has to proceed because of his employment status
4895729 at the end of the conversation dosanjh left sandhu armed with advice that if accepted and acted upon would obstruct justice
4895730 im working at an art store rather than completing my masterpiece which given your lack of facial piercings you are obviously too stupid to understand
4895731 just take it home and see how it looks with leggings and the right shoes
4895732 i go here every christmas eve with my parents what a cliche because this is some of the best chinese food in the city
4895733 one of the most basic principles of our great nation is our respect for personal freedom and i am committed to protecting the freedom of each and every american the government should not determine what marriage is or is not that is up to the people in the relationship i also s upport equalizing the treatment of same sex couples and families civil rights of all americans should be honored and strengthened that is one of my top priorities in congress
4895734 as an avid constitutionalist hailing from the equality state of wyoming i understand that like any other group of people that have been discriminated upon the lgbtq community needs constitutional advocacy i will bring that advocacy to washington and fight for full marriage equality
4895735 gordon smith has not done enough for lgbt rights as a senator i will work in the senate as i have in the oregon house to convince my colleagues to support equality legislation
4895736 look i have been married for 32 years my marriage is so important to me that i wouldnt want to deny it to anyone and i dont see gay marriage as a threat to my marriage what i think is a more important issue is employment is enda thirty three states say it is legal to fire someone for being gay and i think thats a bigger issue
4895737 people in my district dont want to regulate marriage they want to improve their economic conditions and provide for national security
4895738 i support gay marriage because its time that our society became truly equal and stopped discriminating against people based on who they love i think leaders need to show courage in standing up for marriage and equality
4895739 i am deeply committed to the principle of equal treatment under the law it is the bedrock of our democracy our founding principle is that all persons are created equal
4895740 marriage is about love and commitment im proud to stand with the lgbt community in the struggle for marriage equality its no longer good enough to be tolerant elected officials must embrace the lgbt community as valued citizens as taxpayers and as a creative community that adds to our quality of life
4895741 the government has no place in our bedrooms our doctors office or our relationships
4895742 personally i believe in same sex marriage though religious organizations must be free to recognize their own rules i believe the state should not discriminate by providing marital benefits to some but not others
4895743 the attorney general should give his legal opinion before cabinet approves it so that the process is not delayed
4895744 states parties shall take all appropriate measures to protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault rape incest and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the foetus
4895745 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4895746 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4895747 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4895748 implement an idea that curbs torture arbitrary detainment or abuse
4895749 i am really sick the underlying message that this course and everything else i seem hear these days that nonprofits need to be more business like the implicit assumption is that we do not know what we are doing

4895807 to be honest the best time to start shopping was last years back to school clearance
4895808 this years back to school clearance is a great place to stock up for next year
4895809 its a good idea to wait and see which supplies your kids will really need
4895810 oftentimes parents buy their kids brand new markers scissors and glue sticks only to find out that those items are provided by the school and that they should have bought rulers calculators and storage boxes instead
4895811 backpacks tend to be among the more expensive back to school items but its important to look at a backpack as an investment
4895812 a durable quality backpack will cost more up front but will save you money in the long run by lasting through several school years
4895813 some kids just seem to have a knack for losing things even big bulky things like entire backpacks filled with books
4895814 and they often repeat this process more than once a school year
4895815 its amazing how kids get creative when theyre put in charge of their clothing budget
4895816 suddenly they understand what the word designer entails and become more open to less expensive versions of the same look
4895817 i was so dreading bike shopping because so many used bike shops in the bay area have gotten bad reviews or mediocre reviews
4895818 oh were not going to have any in stock for a few month

4895978 linda gave me the best hair cut ever worth every dollar indeed
4895979 why didnt you get your feet done if you had your hands done
4895980 relax your soul while bathing your feet in a fresh lime and tea tree essential oils with intensive callus refining treatment massage warm paraffin
4895981 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
4895982 one of the most basic principles of our great nation is our respect for personal freedom and i am committed to protecting the freedom of each and every american the government should not determine what marriage is or is not that is up to the people in the relationship i also s upport equalizing the treatment of same sex couples and families civil rights of all americans should be honored and strengthened that is one of my top priorities in congress
4895983 as an avid constitutionalist hailing from the equality state of wyoming i understand that like any other group of people that have been discriminated upon the lgbtq community needs constitutional advocacy i will bring that advocacy to washington and fight for full marriage equality
4895984 gordon smith has not done enough for lgbt rights as a senator i will work in the senate as i have in the oregon house to convince my colleagues to support equality legislation
4895985 look i have been married for 32 years my marriage is so important to me that i wouldnt want to deny it to anyone and i dont see gay marriage as a threat to my marriage what i think is a more important issue is employment is enda thirty three states say it is legal to fire someone for being gay and i think thats a bigger issue
4895986 people in my district dont want to regulate marriage they want to improve their economic conditions and provide for national security
4895987 the government has no place in our bedrooms our doctors office or our relationships
4895988 marriage is about love and commitment im proud to stand with the lgbt community in the struggle for marriage equality its no longer good enough to be tolerant elected officials must embrace the lgbt community as valued citizens as taxpayers and as a creative community that adds to our quality of life
4895989 i support gay marriage because its time that our society became truly equal and stopped discriminating against people based on who they love i think leaders need to show courage in standing up for marriage and equality
4895990 i am deeply committed to the principle of equal treatment under the law it is the bedrock of our democracy our founding principle is that all persons are created equal
4895991 personally i believe in same sex marriage though religious organizations must be free to recognize their own rules i believe the state should not discriminate by providing marital benefits to some but not others
4895992 for all the lengths senators barack obama and john mccain have gone to in keeping their hunt for a vice president under wraps their deliberations are in some ways being conducted in plain sight in indiana last week mr obama appeared with
4895993 barack is in a different situation and he needs somebody who can be safe and steady
4895994 its time to bite the bullet senator nunn get with the program
4895995 as can be seen by revisiting nunns past words and deeds the true source behind opposition to gay service was never concerns about unit cohesion as was often stated but moral animus to gay rights
4895996 strongly held moral belief that homosexuals should not be role models for our children
4895997 american family deterioration is one of the biggest problems we face in our culture
4895998 if obama picks former sam nunn as his vice presidential running mate
4895999 i would have a hard time voting for the democratic ticket i would be virtually useless in trying to convince other gays and lesbians to support the ticket
4896000 nunns positions on equal rights for the lgbt community should be reason enough to keep him off the ticket
4896001 the idea of obama picking nunn to run as his vice president is preposterous
4896002 as sen barack obama considers potential running mates he should contemplate with caution
4896003 if obama taps nunn he could end up adding gay men and lesbians to the list of disgruntled democrats they might not vote for mccain but they might very well stay home
4896004 revisiting is not admitting a mistake or apologizing for the pain he inflicted or the tens of thousands of lives affected by the policy surely there are more compelling choices out there for vice president
4896005 we dont think he would be a good choice i dont think there is any serious talk of him being selected for vice president i dont think its something our community should be alarmed about but its something our community should be aware of
4896006 for all nunns qualifications there would be very little enthusiasm for him within the lgbt community
4896007 as can be seen by revisiting nunns past words and deeds the true source behind opposition to gay service was never concerns about unit cohesion as was often stated but moral animus to gay rights
4896008 senator nunn has got to go all the way on opening the military to qualified gays and lesbians who want to serve not half way as hes been doing lately
4896009 no single issue more poignantly snaps our armed forces into the 21st century than the question of whether homosexuals should be permitted to serve openly in their ranks
4896010 our military cannot afford to stray long from the society it defends the pressures for it to catch up are mounting within and without
4896011 it might be time to take another look at dont ask dont tell

4896013 obama is going to need people who understand the global landscape and know how to work washington to get things done and thats where nunn can be a huge help
4896014 frankly the assertion that gays liberal and democratic gays that is may sit out the presidential race if nunn is chosen by obama is difficult to take seriously given obamas record in illinois and in the senate his overall ideology and the effusive endorsement of him earlier this month by the human rights campaign the nations largest gay lesbian bisexual and transgender civil rights group its absurd to suggest that politically interested gays who otherwise agree with obama and share his values would withhold their vote if he selected nunn to join his ticket
4896015 i reported that to them and they had both of those names on their list
4896016 if barack obama selected georgias former u s senator sam nunn as his vice presidential running mate would you be more or less likely to vote for barack obama
4896017 but nunn may be the best pick for barack obama in a year when the presumptive democratic nominee has no obvious choices if some potential candidate could immediately offer strength to obama on the economy he should pick him or her but no one fits that bill which leaves the field open to a foreign policy heavyweight who could help compensate for the slim resume of a freshman senator the notion that obama would be better off pretending this weakness didnt exist that he should double down on change with a young running mate ignores the readiness bar obama still needs to clear
4896018 on the whole nunns resistance to gays in the military 15 years ago it ought to be noted would be a plus for an obama led ticket not a minus obama unlike john mccain doesnt really have a problem with his base in this election

4896159 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4896160 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4896161 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4896162 it allowed managers maybe to avoid the threat of takeover and therefore encouraged inefficiency
4896163 theres a lot of statistics canada evidence now to show that even foreign companies have done a pretty good job of running canadian companies and improving their productivity that maybe this is all not such a negative thing after all
4896164 when you are operating as an income trust and have the high valuations at that point and the very high distributions it made it difficult for someone to come in and do a takeover based on such a very high valuation
4896165 foreign takeover will result in less tax at both the federal and provincial levels
4896166 also private equity will load up debt in canada on the strength of the canadian asset base rendering the operation basically non taxable in canada and interest crossing the border will be free of withholding tax

4896238 doris t august 15 2008 at 6 06 pm by way of the website hawaii reporter i found out that there are two kingdoms in hawaii the nation kingdom of hawaii and the united states as of 2002 the nation kingdom has filed a formal complaint with the united nations stating that the u s is occupying hawaii illegally since 1898 and has taken all their native citizens to be citizens of the u s i thought what the heck is going on here is sounds to me like they want the u s out of their nation the hawaii reporter has also stated that the laws of the nation kingdom take precedence over any u s laws so since the supposed illegal occupation of the u s on hawaii soil has not been settled why the heck is obama being considered for presidency since he is a citizen of the nation kingdom of hawaii first and foremost maybe the democratic party thinks it would be in the u s best interest to have a hawaiian native as our presidency to put the complaint to rest i dont know the answer to the above but i would question whether the nation kingdom of hawaii would have any claims if obama were elected the president

4896399 our survey revealed that there was essentially no hard evidence of organized child abusing satanic cults that had infiltrated preschools or the fbi or that had kidnapped or slain babies in contrast there was much indirect evidence of clinical induction of false memories and plentiful evidence of religion related abuse including sexual abuse by catholic priests although much of my research indicates that children can have largely accurate memories and can resist strong suggestions they can in contrast as indicated by the dramatic examples of ritual abuse claims also tell wild tales cave in to misleading questions and make important errors the same is true of some adults of course all of the books about personal cases of sra were written by adults who seem to have believed their own stories

4896450 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4896451 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
4896452 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakable
4896453 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure

4896456 ample evidence that several un staff members up and down the hierarchy may have failed to respond adequately to the algiers attacks both before and after the tragedy
4896457 the explicit targeting of the un by terrorist groups represents a sea change among the threats
4896458 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4896459 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4896460 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4896461 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4896462 we dont believe in a seperation of faith and politics because faith is nothing more than our world view which we all have
4896463 i am trying to convince you this is what i believe
4896464 huh hes a smoother talker and he sounded good but what did he say
4896465 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited

4896480 given whats been on the table no deal is better than a bad deal a doha conclusion would have had major negative impacts for workers and farmers in developing countries the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
4896481 there just hasnt been much to gain for developing countries in this round or for that matter the majority of people even in the rich countries
4896482 the attempts by the rich countries to reduce policy space for developing countries in manufacturing are widely seen as kicking away the ladder that rich countries like the united states used when they were developing countries
4896483 the whole process of subordinating national policy to special commercial interests whether in agriculture telecommunications pharmaceuticals one of the most powerful interests and gainers in the wto or the financial sector has gone way too far growth and development in most countries has been hurt and they are pushing back in the united states too rising inequality and now an economic downturn have provoked a backlash
4896484 the wto negotiations have turned into a fight by developed countries to open markets in developing countries to favor their big companies
4896485 back to the drawing board no basis for concluding the doha round of negotiations
4896486 winners and losers impact of the doha round on developing countries
4896487 are central american nations moving toward neo liberal free markets or a 21st century form of bolivarian socialism
4896488 conservative pro american regimes in colombia mexico and much of central america
4896489 by portraying muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics including being a threat to the west this explicit expression of islamophobia further perpetuates and promotes prejudice toward muslims and others
4896490 in much of the developed world one uses racial epithets at ones legal peril one displays nazi regalia and the other trappings of ethnic hatred at significant legal risk
4896491 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4896492 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4896493 yesterday i saw manchester city and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4896494 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4896495 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4896496 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast england is different
4896497 he is a very good player i like him very much but so do all the other coaches in the world
4896498 exactly what is happening with him i dont know at the moment
4896499 it is not my business it is the business for the board to talk about money
4896500 he is a fantastic player who could play in any team in the world but i am pleased with my players at chelsea if one or two more players arrive it will be better for us
4896501 we play 60 or 70 games a year so the door is always open for the players here and maybe one or two more in the future
4896502 but if we lose against portsmouth it wont be because robinho is not here it will be because we havent played well
4896503 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward
4896504 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4896505 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good
4896506 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4896507 i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea
4896508 it is something ive said many times and after signing this contract i am very happy and positive i will finish as a player here
4896509 ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4896510 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of them a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
4896511 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
4896512 everyone knows inter milan made a bid for me and that was something i had to look at
4896513 that was a possibility when we knew they had made an offer for me i had to make a decision for myself and this club has been very very good to me
4896514 i dont see any squads as strong as us i feel very excited to be part of the future and now hopefully we can win back some titles
4896515 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
4896516 i feel for sure ive made 100 the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
4896517 it has taken a while to get the deal done and there has been a bit of compromise on both sides
4896518 its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
4896519 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there this is a great day for the club
4896520 she has all this curly dark hair you cant even believe it
4896521 why cant that be enough why do i need you to be suicidal why do i need you to be either sexually repressed or sexually explosive why do i need to you be in a serious relationship already with a guy who isnt me
4896522 with papers i would get 1 000 euros a month

4896525 we are french workers just without any rights yes were citizens because france owned all of black africa
4896526 their action is legitimate theyve been here for years working contributing to the social security system paying taxes and were satisfied with their work

4896531 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
4896532 we didnt win the title we were very close but in the end we lost
4896533 and the champions league final everybody was disappointed about this
4896534 but we have to look forward to the next season we have a good squad and another chance to win four titles i am happy and i am prepared for this season now everything is fine and i am looking forward to playing next season
4896535 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
4896536 he was not fazed by the physical challenge he has strength and he looks as if he has the ingredients to do it in england
4896537 all the lads are already saying well get inter in the champions league and you just know we probably will meet them
4896538 jose was a top manager and someone i loved working with
4896539 but it was a change the club made so weve moved on and moved forward
4896540 under jose we never did any running but with scolari weve had our trainers on and done 1 000 metres which is similar to the vialli and ranieri style of thinking
4896541 now we all feel really good and well prepared for our opener against portsmouth

4896587 chris nolan insisted that we all play everything for truth so much so that at times it didnt even feel like a comic book movie as if including batman was incidental to the crime drama we were filming a lot of times in big movies the truth gets overlooked or just doesnt matter
4896588 even though the situations were often larger than life and based in fantasy he wanted us to play all of those moments with as much emotional honesty as we could find in them

4896624 it is a forward looking platform in so many areas including those relating to lgbt people
4896625 for the first time the platform explicitly calls for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
4896626 the 2008 democratic national platform will be a guiding document for policy and legislation that embodies the values of our party
4896627 these advancements in our partys binding document are thanks to the work and input of lgbt delegates senator obama and his campaign lgbt advocates and stonewall democrats across the country
4896628 democrats will fight to end discrimination based on race sex ethnicity national origin language religion sexual orientation gender identity age and disability in every corner of our country because thats the america we believe in
4896629 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections
4896630 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
4896631 the 2008 platform reiterates and strengthens past support for legislation that would protect our community including calls for the passage of hate crimes and comprehensive employment discrimination legislation and the repeal of the discriminatory dont ask dont tell policy in our nations military
4896632 the platform also supports the full inclusion of same sex couples and their families with equal rights benefits and responsibilities
4896633 the platform also supports other issues of importance to for glbt and all americans including a call for a national strategy to combat hiv aids support for fair and impartial judges not driven by ideology and requirements that faith based programs not use federal dollars to discriminate
4896634 the gay agenda its dividing the family the church and a nation
4896635 what gives you the right whats the difference between you and me
4896636 when their enemies were at the gates the romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city and it wasnt considered an honor it was considered a public service
4896637 youll hunt me youll condemn me set the dogs on me because thats what needs to happen

4896677 if people dont have the opportunity to have work that is legal and just and that they can make a living then they do what they have to do and that is something everyone should be concerned about
4896678 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
4896679 people voted for change and they voted for democrats who will take our country in a new direction
4896680 the public doesnt want to know about process and 60 votes they want outcomes they want results
4896681 whether its the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out
4896682 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today

4896689 after seven years of blind alleys and false accusations we have to ask well has the fbi once again let their zeal replace evidence
4896690 a person who has been briefed on the investigation said on sunday
4896691 evidence amassed by f b i investigators against dr bruce e ivins was largely circumstantial
4896692 newly released fbi evidence makes a strong circumstantial case that bioweapons researcher ivins was a delusional sociopath who had the opportunity motive and means to be the 2001 anthrax killer
4896693 a flask of anthrax spores recovered in 2004 from ivins personal workspace at ft detrick the army weapons lab where he worked
4896694 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
4896695 he bin laden just decreed death to all jews and all americans
4896696 it may well be that absent a trial it will fall to reporters to aggressively test the solidity of the case against ivins
4896697 but this is a circumstantial case with no absolute proof that he did it
4896698 amy the fbi says it can trace the anthrax used in the attacks directly to dr ivins and it says he repeatedly tried to mislead investigators
4896699 tonight a lawyer for dr ivins says the fbi never found anthrax in his house or in his car or anything else directly linking him to the mailings
4896700 and without a trial well never hear what dr ivins wouldve said in his own defense
4896701 even when you look at the scientific evidence in that flask the anthrax spores that were in that flask charlie a lot of researchers in that lab also had access to it
4896702 oh by the way lets give you the reasons to why we think he sent out and went on this homicidal rage
4896703 well he helped develop a vaccine for anthrax he probably wanted to continue to see that developed so that by killing people by having come up with some unknown way of this high military grade anthrax we would keep the vaccine program going
4896704 hes involved hes got a role in it hes done something

4896712 i hope this will be the most rewarding educational experience of your lives
4896713 last year i was quoted about tiredness and all those sort of things but as soon as id seen the scenario and the schedules i just decided to bite the bullet and mentally said to myself that right here right now is an opportunity for me to play six seven eight years of really hard international cricket and give it everything ive got and look back with no regrets i see this as an opportunity to continue to do that

4896720 these people are out of step with the republican party
4896721 we hope to inform those attending about the rich history and philosophies of so many republican leaders who fought for equality and against discrimination and hate
4896722 the court brazenly disregarded the will of the people and sent california down a road that will destroy traditional family values

4896726 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4896727 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4896728 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4896729 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4896730 no real purpose for being on the streets at those hours

4896735 if i retired after september my health coverage would cost 172 a month
4896736 if i was married and had a husband who had medical coverage id stay
4896737 if they dont go their health insurance cost when they retire increases dramatically
4896738 the problem is many of these folks were not looking to retire
4896739 if i retired after september my health coverage would cost 172 a month
4896740 i came to the university when nobody wanted to work for the state
4896741 we didnt get the pay raises but we got the benefits
4896742 its like running for a touchdown and you get to the ten yard line
4896743 and then they shut the lights off and they penalize me
4896744 these games have brought a lot of attention to beijing
4896745 especially the opening ceremony which was the best one i have seen
4896746 before china was always known for gymnastics and table tennis
4896747 but now running and swimming how can i even say the feeling
4896748 we can create a new history by winning gold medals in all fields not just the traditional ones
4896749 were really proud of our country now because of the way they have held the games and that the athletes are doing really well
4896750 i think china has been doing very hard things to make the olympics successful
4896751 its worth it the whole world looks at china in a new way its not about the old culture anymore
4896752 the chinese communist party says not to mix politics and the games but the way the party is politicizing the games surpasses the politicization of the berlin games in 1936
4896753 having the games in a nation like china that does not cherish human rights and freedom is not a blessing to the rest of the world
4896754 is the constitutional grant of authority to ban mere possession of cocaine today

4896768 the greater danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it but that it is too low and we reach it

4896775 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4896776 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4896777 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4896778 you cant get caught up on how a teams going good or bad
4896779 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
4896780 i dont think hes too worried about whos at the plate
4896781 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
4896782 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
4896783 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
4896784 hes been doing that for years when he stays healthy
4896785 at its inception speech recognition sr was sold as a way to completely eliminate transcription rather than make the transcription process more efficient hence it was not accepted it was also the case that sr at that time was often technically deficient additionally to be used effectively it required changes to the ways physicians worked and documented clinical encounters which many if not all were reluctant to do the biggest limitation to speech recognition automating transcription however is seen as the software the nature of narrative dictation is highly interpretive and often requires judgment that may be provided by a real human but not yet by an automated system another limitation has been the extensive amount of time required by the user and or system provider to train the software

4896790 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4896797 state the church is none of your business leave her alone
4896798 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
4896799 reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
4896800 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
4896801 the establishment of religion clause means at least this neither a state nor the federal government may set up a church
4896802 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
4896803 the first amendment has erected a wall between church and state
4896804 i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature
4896805 penn said young american adults have already demonstrated that they can have powerful effect on the financial market through multi million dollar social networks like myspace and facebook it is time that the younger generation uses that power in the voting booth he said
4896806 among the states up for grabs in this years presidential race is a surprise virginia it hasnt voted for a democrat since lyndon johnson in 1964 but in recent years virginia has elected back to back democratic governors and a u s senator and a democrat is highly favored to win this years senate race all of which has the barack obama campaign thinking it can turn the state from red to blue
4896807 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
4896808 the last time virginia 13 electoral votes went for a democratic presidential candidate was 1964 in 2004 the gops margin was eight points that makes virginia an uphill climb for mr obama but not out of reach hes focused on increasing african american voters in hampton roads in the southeastern corner of the state richmond and petersburg and on deepening his strength in northern virginia where fairfax was one of only 60 counties in america to flip from republican in 00 to democrat in 04
4896809 obviously senator obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
4896810 america after eight years of the bush administration is ready for excellence kaine said at a meeting in leesburg arguing that sen john mccain of arizona if elected would be an extension of the current republican administration kaine said yesterday that if obama can take the state there is no path for john mccain to get enough electoral votes to win
4896811 we were going to do that at some point anyway hopefully its just a two week thing and well get him out there again see how he finishes up thatll be interesting to watch too
4896812 im not tired or anything i still have speed on my pitches
4896813 really it was one of his better games he wasnt getting into that winging it mode
4896814 hes established himself as a really good left handed starter
4896815 he made a lot of progress especially on the mental side

4896825 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4896826 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4896827 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of
4896828 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4896829 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4896830 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4896831 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4896832 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4896833 we feel the city should be ashamed of this secret prison theyve set up
4896834 the public was never going to view this place it was just found out
4896835 they got caught with this place they told our lawyers in negotiations that this place didnt even exist
4896836 we have a lot of work to do but this game also showed we have a lot of potential
4896837 we had a number of great opportunities and they will come we still dont have everyone 100 percent out there but we played a lot of people tonight and we got to look at a lot of different combinations
4896838 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4896839 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4896840 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4896841 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4896859 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4896860 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4896861 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4896862 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change

4896963 it was the time when some wanted to move a peace keeping force into beirut and i thought there was no way it would end well having a small number of american troops in that region and it was hard to go against ronald reagan for whom i worked and deeply respected and also my party and i voted against it and then the marine barracks was bombed and we lost over 100 brave soles

4896975 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4896976 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4896977 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4896978 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
4896979 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
4896980 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu

4897009 in all honesty youre losing one of the great training grounds for the next generation of entrepreneurs and scientists
4897010 history would suggest that it will be very difficult for roche to keep the same vibrancy of innovation that genentech saw under an independent structure
4897011 you just have to reflect at least a bit about the legacy of genentech and the scientific patina it established for the bay area

4897021 the border wall does not stop humans but it will stop jaguars and other wildlife it is already wreaking havoc on the southern part of oregon pipe national monument
4897022 the contrast between the report findings and the environmental assessment displays the bush administrations wholly meaningless approach to environmental analysis
4897023 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
4897024 its time for homeland security to lift its embargo on environmental laws the border fence does not stop humans now we have more proof if the walls destruction of our national treasures

4897079 leadership be it among students institutions or at the national level involved qualities and that a good leader must be prepared to be a good listener be patient tolerant principled and believe in what he must do consistently and be courageous to say black is black and white is white and that the leader must put the truth above partisan interest
4897080 to remember that leadership is power derived from the strength of the people and whatever the condition power is transient
4897081 that is why when i see people come to political office and strut themselves as kings or as peacocks my heart bleeds

4897144 90 of the dogs come from overseas because europe has a long history of breeding dogs with the proper temperament for security duties while u s breeders breed mostly pets or pretty show dogs

4897146 plenty of american breeders who breed these kinds of dogs and they dont charge this exorbitant amount of money
4897147 using canines is smart security paying 4 000 for an untrained european canine seems excessive a waste of taxpayer money and does not support the breeders we have right here at home

4897155 mankind would no longer be if we do not possess the ability to love and raise love in other people
4897156 humanity will exist as a species as long as the people love whenever the last man on earth is no longer filled with love then the spirit of the human kind will turn around and will leave without any delay this earth
4897157 if you learn to love then you support that the spirit of our kind remains in this generation on earth if you learn to awaken love in other human beings then the spirit of the human kind will be here as long as these people live
4897158 if you learn to teach the ability to love to the people in general then perhaps we human beings remain as long as the planetll is alive

4897199 wal mart has bullied its workers and managers for years now it wants to bully the political process and the fec should take threats very seriously
4897200 wal mart has shown exactly why our nation needs the employee free choice act we must outlaw the kind of behavior for which wal mart is famous and give workers a free and fair choice on whether to form a union
4897201 there is reason to believe that wal mart stores inc has made prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against senator obamas election to employees who were not in its restricted class in violation of 2 u s c 441b we request that the commission immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and if so to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal election law
4897202 informing employees that it is imperative that the employee free choice act not be enacted and simultaneously that their voting for senator obama and other democrats would lead to its enactment constitutes express advocacy
4897203 the employee free choice act is strongly opposed by wal mart because it would in fact go a long way toward rectifying the imbalance that currently exists between workers seeking to form unions and employers that oppose them currently the law fails to effectively protect workers seeking to organize and employers are able to violate the law with virtual impunity this legislation would allow workers throughout the united states to decide whether or not to form a union if an employer intimidates or obstructs a workers free choice it would incur increased penalties senator obama is a co sponsor of the legislation while his republican opponent senator john mccain opposes the bill and voted against bringing it to the senate floor last year

4897329 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
4897330 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
4897331 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
4897332 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
4897333 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
4897334 the new zealand government does not support the death penalty under any circumstances
4897335 clearly these men are guilty of heinous crimes and those crimes in any jurisdiction would justify them getting very serious penalties available under law but the new zealand government will not and does not support the death penalty
4897336 when it comes to the question of the death penalty no diplomatic intervention will ever be made by any government that i lead in support of any individual terrorist life

4897347 all of a sudden youre 40 years old and you realize the time is now life is just moving way too fast and im not enjoying the present enough i realized my true north was about my family but i was making it about everything else in the future
4897348 im trying to turn it around i really want to savor the present
4897349 theyre not as driven as their parents were career wise and theres more emphasis on family togetherness they want their kids to have a good future but theres less insanity about it

4897353 were to the point where i know what they can do so we just got to get ready to play
4897354 and were learning new words like little linguistic sponges if sponges can be said to learn
4897355 the games on the line and were out there going for it
4897356 lets win another nine and no one will remember this one
4897357 i hadnt been on the hill to start in a while i felt i had command of my pitches
4897358 he threw me a little cutter that ran in i just told myself get jammed and try to hit it to the right side and luckily for us i did
4897359 if you fool me once i wont get fooled again
4897360 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4897361 im sick of it im sick of everyone you all have no fucking idea what its like ive spent my whole life putting up with it and i wont do it anymore
4897362 come on harry dont let that skeeter bitch ruin today
4897363 its not just rita fucking skeeter its everybody she just put the bloody cherry on top
4897364 dont talk soft ron thats all anybody wants to talk about five years since i killed him and thats all anybody cares about i hate being harry potter i hate it i wish id never been born
4897365 no ron im not for ten years thats all ive had look look its him the poor boy whose parents were murdered look look its him the boy who killed voldemort look its him harry fucking potter ive had people trying to be my friend just because they want a bit of gold ive had people throwing themselves at me so they can say theyve shagged the famous harry potter staring and pointing wherever i go eyes fixed on the scar whenever im talking to people i cant take it anymore
4897366 oh please ron dont give me that shit youre just like that look everyone harry potter is my best friend look everyone i live with harry potter look everyone arent i lucky i get to fuck harry potter dont pretend that you dont love lapping up all the attention you always have
4897367 i forgot youre the famous harry potter you can treat your boyfriend and best friend like total shit and with a simple sorry hell come crawling back because youre harry potter i wouldnt want to miss out on all that wonderful attention i get when im with you now would i
4897368 i shouldnt have said any of that thats not what i think at all i promise you
4897369 good cause i never got any bloody attention with you around i might have loved the attention if id got any but with you around nobody ever noticed me
4897370 i thought it was cool for about five minutes when we were eleven years old after that the potter part wasnt important my best friend is harry just harry
4897371 you might be harry potter to the rest of the world but to the people who matter thats not important me hermione ginny neville luna we all love you because of what you are not who you are
4897372 im not going to say that i understand because i dont no one can understand how you must feel i cant even imagine how you must feel im still getting used to the fact that people recognise me since they found out that were together
4897373 after everything youve done for the wizarding world you should be proud to be who you are that people want to stop you in the street to thank you for saving us
4897374 i didnt choose to do that stuff ron i had to anyone would have done the same in my position sometimes it sounds awful i know but i just wish that i hadnt done all that stuff that people didnt know who i was that i wasnt harry potter
4897375 well theres nothing i can do to change what youve done and theres nothing i can do to change the fact that people recognise you in the street but well what if i said that you didnt have to be harry potter
4897376 id say ron what the bloody hell are you on about
4897377 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4897378 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4897379 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4897380 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4897381 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4897382 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4897383 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4897384 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4897385 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4897386 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4897387 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4897388 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4897389 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4897390 pendidikan telah menjauhkan para mahasiswa terhadap realitas sosialnya mahasiswa menjadi belajar untuk hanya memikirkan dirinya sendiri berdiri tunggal di atas kemewahan intelektual yang dimiliki namun ketidakberdayaan mereka mahasiswa untuk mentransformasikan kemewahan intelektual yang ada pada diri mereka kepada realitas sosialnya menjadikan ilmu mereka tak lebih dan tak kurang adalah sampah
4897391 sistem pemilihan secara langsung adalah sistem demokrasi kuno yang ada pada jaman romawi kenyataannya negara negara maju telah meninggalkan sistem ini dan beralih ke sistem demokrasi perwakilan
4897392 ada banyak alasan mengapa seseorang memilih golput di luar masalah administrasi seperti pendataan bisa jadi masalah ideologi
4897393 we were going to do that at some point anyway hopefully its just a two week thing and well get him out there again see how he finishes up thatll be interesting to watch too
4897394 im not tired or anything i still have speed on my pitches
4897395 really it was one of his better games he wasnt getting into that winging it mode
4897396 hes established himself as a really good left handed starter
4897397 he made a lot of progress especially on the mental side
4897398 bagram airbase is located in the parvan province approximately 11 kilometers 7 miles southeast of the city of charikar and 47 kilometers 27 miles north of kabul
4897399 i then typed in charikar afghanistan and looked roughly 7 miles to the southeast in google maps heres a sample of what i found
4897400 yeah i won a gold medal i won it in marbles
4897401 heres a garden that will come up tall and flourish and grow all over the place every year and all you have to do is water it
4897402 estou muito feliz por ter conseguido essa coloca o e ter melhorado a minha marca
4897403 dear god that has to be hot in that uniform in egypt
4897404 it was wonderful to get out there and have somebody else line up across from you
4897405 it has been a full long two weeks of training camp but you cant prepare for things you get in these scrimmages just coming together as a team against somebody else is a big deal
4897406 its your first test playing against somebody else and you always look forward to that
4897407 angleton is a very good 4a school and a great team for us get prepared for the season
4897408 were big strong and physical and need to face a faster team to work on those areas
4897409 you know angleton has the speed at times our lack of speed really showed and then we make a good play i thought we did a good job at the line of scrimmage and i was very pleased with the kids performance
4897410 we came into this scrimmage looking to work with our offensive and defensive lines
4897411 columbia is big and that was a great thing for us to work against i thought our guys up front did a great job it was a great test for them were going to keep working on our blocking and need to play more physical and aggressive
4897412 does your father wear a tie to work lets see a show of hands
4897413 it is like they are destined to do what they were supposed to do since the state tournament and that is win this thing
4897414 they knew they were going to need six wins to win it all and they are counting them so now they are down to four
4897415 i just told him to bear down and start throwing because he has the best defense in the whole world behind him
4897416 once he got past that first inning he was all right
4897417 i was a bit surprised because i thought pacific northwests second pitcher that they brought in was better than the starter
4897418 it just seems like they didnt start their best against us but the boys did great and even when that new pitcher came in they just kept pounding away
4897419 i thought pacific northwest wasnt a bad team they just had a bad outing
4897420 we have so many divers and tourists coming here to dive
4897421 shipwreck history is such a big part of our area
4897422 saved the story of the andrea doria the greatest sea rescue in history
4897423 where do you see any simularity with trance style in this track
4897424 everything you do on agressive and to euforic way i can achieve same effect on people with much more relaxing style amp production
4897425 i am in every way a man of print shaped by its biases and hierarchies tinged by its not so buried elitist premises
4897426 were working real hard and the coaching staff is pleased with the progress of the team we have a lot of work to do to get ready with a new group of kids theres only six players with any credible friday night experience but well get there
4897427 we feel like we made a statement last year and its key to maintain that momentum
4897428 despite a lack of experience these young guys are coming to play the seniors we do have are quality players were just going to need a lot of guys to grow up fast and step up their play
4897429 were going to have a lot of kids play both ways so we want to keep some of these guys fresh
4897430 those are all good quality backs theyll all get time and well see how things work out
4897431 weve never been able to keep anybody at quarterback on the junior varsity team for an entire season
4897432 hes gained some good experience there iwest is a great athlete and a smart kid we think hell be able to do a lot
4897433 were going to be bigger and stronger on the offensive line than weve been in a long time
4897434 we feel good about the kids we have there well have some depth and right now theres a lot of competition for starters
4897435 last year we had one of the best defenses in the area because of our quickness and we feel like well be just as capable of doing the same things as last year
4897436 were returning just four players on that side of the ball but our defense is something we take pride in
4897437 were quick have some depth and have several strong players
4897438 we play a tough schedule in one of the toughest districts and theres some new schools and you really never know what to expect its not going to be easy but if we work hard and do the things we need to then well be right there
4897439 poverty contributes a lot to child trafficking many parents allow their children to cities and other countries in exchange for money small gifts and other promises from the traffickers on the other hand children leave their homes to look for better life in the cities
4897440 we have decided to embark on training because the majority of journalists in both rural and urban areas are not aware of child trafficking
4897441 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
4897442 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
4897443 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4897444 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
4897445 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
4897446 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
4897447 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4897448 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
4897449 as a society we should be finding more ways for people especially older people to stay involved and active at any age we need to begin to think beyond the boundaries of the stairmaster
4897450 physical fitness is important but social engagement is turning out to be just as critical to longevity what i tell people is find something you really like doing that involves other people whether its playing cards or walking in the mall social engagement adds a sense of purpose to peoples lives it also seems to add years to those lives
4897451 i told them it was a private party and to clear off but this big youth put his face right into mine and said make me
4897452 as i tackled him six of them came over the top of me i received a big hit to the side of my head
4897453 there were six or seven really big buff guys on top of my dad hitting him i had to try and pull him out
4897454 i am certainly not a hero i just defended my property and my sons friends there were a group of 15 year old girls there too
4897455 people have had enough this gang has been terrorising people whose kids are having parties for months now somebody needed to stand up to them
4897456 i know that if dad had not stood up to them they would have completely trashed the house and stolen anything they could get their hands on
4897457 all i would suggest if a situation arises again leave it to the police to handle
4897458 all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
4897459 india may defer a decision for several years however the political and military challenge posed by communist china will probably lead to an eventual indian decision to join the nuclear club
4897460 fears that it will eventually be overwhelmed by its more populous arab neighbours
4897461 sees a possibility that nuclear weapons may be required to defend the principle of neutrality
4897462 does not wish to lead a parade but might follow
4897463 escape clauses of treaty would prevent gop from being disadvantaged if it signed and goi did not and goi proceeded with development of nuclear weapons and means of delivery
4897464 has been perceived by india as a direct blow to its own prestige and political position and as a potential threat to its security
4897465 might be ready to test a nuclear weapons device in perhaps a years time
4897466 it is likely that india would feel compelled to seek missiles if they could not be procured india would have to undertake a prolonged development program for which its industrial base is not well suited
4897467 probably bring the issue of indias going nuclear to a head earlier than in the case of the other nuclear capable countries
4897468 although now lacking in the technical capabilities necessary for a nuclear weapons program pakistan would undoubtedly seek to acquire them a new pak alignment with communist china could result
4897469 to meet the political and security incentives that are at the root of the nuclear proliferation issue as it has arisen in india
4897470 recent discussion between the u s representative in geneva and his indian counterpart
4897471 the latter said explicitly that a non proliferation treaty would not be worth having if it focused on what he termed the hypothetical nth country problem rather than the real problem posed by communist chinas growing nuclear capability
4897472 military aid to strengthen indias defence against the communist chinese conventional threat
4897473 to make clear to india that she does not have to consider exploding a nuclear device to achieve recognition
4897474 collective alternatives to national deterrence involving a closer nuclear relationship with the u s
4897475 and is not likely to materialize before many years have passed if indeed it materializes at all
4897476 if the americans want to come to our aid against an attack by the chinese they will even if we dont sign the npt and if they dont want to come to our aid they wont even if we do sign the treaty
4897477 the need for such arrangements is the more urgent since an indian national nuclear program which may prove difficult to avoid could well have serious repercussions in two key allied countries germany and japan
4897478 it will be important to have developed a workable collective arrangement in europe which will meet german aspirations and by subsuming the u k s national capability set a useful example for japan before india goes nuclear
4897479 my son and husband just saw this today we would
4897480 what awesome prizes thank you so much for this wonderful
4897481 i have really been wanting to see this i have
4897482 we want ice to know theyre not welcome here in asheville we want asheville to be a sanctuary for immigrants this country was built by immigrants and unless you are a native american you are descended from immigrants
4897483 they have a lot to contribute to us both through the work that they do through their culture through their knowledge and i think that right now were kind of ignoring that if we continue to ignore that and allow the government to make policies that arent neccessarily reflective of our values then its going to cascade into a situation in which were going to be living in a state that no one desires
4897484 what awesome prizes thank you so much for this wonderful
4897485 what awesome prizes thank you so much for this wonderful
4897486 what awesome prizes thank you so much for this wonderful
4897487 what awesome prizes thank you so much for this wonderful
4897488 what awesome prizes thank you so much for this wonderful
4897489 how many are there at p tionville now 30 or 31
4897490 our main focus will be on quality and were going to give a lot of bands that dont have a chance to be heard on the radio that opportunity
4897491 we want to be playing everything from indie rock to hip hop to classic rock to soul to dance rock
4897492 i was obviously super nervous about working for clear channel if it wasnt for evan i probably wouldnt be doing this
4897493 but i always loved the idea of working with the system to do something cool rather than just complaining about the system all the time even though we work with clear channel were not them were geared to give artists a chance to be heard whether it be talking about music or playing live concerts or broadcasting multiple tracks off a record its not just playing one single
4897494 as close as you ll come to achieving the best of both worlds
4897495 when you commit to something the hard work that you put in you want the prize at the end and theyve identified the prize
4897496 im not a betting guy but i would put down everything on this team winning
4897497 we were expecting them to come out and hit everything being able to execute their strategies and keep us off balance so we wanted to take it to them and be physical with them
4897498 a little weird because we were playing for high stakes going against each other it was a little different than playing in practice
4897499 i was disappointed not surprised that we didnt do a better job than we did tonight
4897500 absolutely it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champion this was a big game for us
4897501 we were able to read the floor very well and get our hands on balls and steal and be aggressive
4897502 weve got to continue to do what we do best which is run execute our zone offense which is something we did very very well tonight and something that were going to need to improve on in the quarterfinals and the later rounds so thats what well stay focused on and offensive rebounding is obviously a big key as well
4897503 you cant get caught up on how a teams going good or bad
4897504 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
4897505 i dont think hes too worried about whos at the plate
4897506 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
4897507 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
4897508 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
4897509 hes been doing that for years when he stays healthy
4897510 in fact until you mentioned it i didnt think about it its good to have them both back
4897511 even when we were in spartanburg he was still there and i was telling him to watch my technique and let me know when my footwork is bad and when im doing something wrong
4897512 hes been helping out the corners letting us know if youre playing a little too far off or youre playing this way thats why i did this route
4897513 you lost my data find it and if you cant make it right somehow
4897514 more and more consumers are signing up to these sites every day and chances are theyll put on their date of birth location email job and marital status
4897515 fraudsters can use this information to steal an individuals identity and open accounts in their name
4897516 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4897517 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4897518 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4897519 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
4897520 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
4897521 let me make one thing perfectly clear i would never advocate any course of action that would damage the state of colorados rights over the water or any other water resources that is going to be one of the most precious commodities for colorado and the entire west
4897522 hes talking about ongoing conversations conversations that happen this year next year 10 20 30 years down the road
4897523 as long as water is going to be an issue in the west there should be an open conversation among all parties
4897524 produced water or other deep ground water beyond the grasp of states water laws
4897525 in alaska and texas they have to drill for it in oregon it falls from the sky
4897526 instead of drinking their own shit they decided theyd rather drink sacramentos
4897527 its gorgeous here we dont have any natural disasters no forest fires no hurricanes tornadoes or floods good schools lots of cheap land the cost of livings down we have proximity to the colorado river to flagstaff to las vegas to phoenix
4897528 theres going to be quite a few more people looking to kingman once the dam bypass goes through
4897529 the meek shall inherit mars but not its water rights

4897539 my sister in law and niece arrived in entebbe early in the morning and we went straight from the airport to st mary kevins after the various greetings and a tour given by joan i see different things each time i walk around e broke out a polaroid camera and you can imagine the fun we had taking pictures and giving them out to the kids we ran out of film at some point we were treated to a terrific music presentation of dancing and songs and when approached to get up my hesitation was short lived and we got up and danced with them nicholas made a point of bringing more of his paintings to give to you and his pen pal joshua along with that i am returning with lots of jewelry more small banana babies and an envelope stuffed with letters for pen pals i sadly left kampala this morning and have arrived in arusha at the base of the mountain i am here for a few days of preparation and we start out on sunday morning we are all excited about this adventure but honestly my thoughts are still in kampala and i think it will be an experience i wont soon forget

4897543 me da igual en qu condiciones se desarrolle la carrera en seco pude ser segundo y en mojado he sido el m s r pido cada vez tengo mejores sensaciones en agua antes no me gustaba nada me sentaba como a los gatos pero ahora voy como un tibur n debido a la confianza tan grande que tengo con la moto

4897554 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
4897555 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4897556 we by no means are trying to film the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film series as soon possible
4897557 what they did was not in effect during the race
4897558 they didnt have an illegal part or engine during the race they tried to do something involving a magnet so that we wouldnt get a true reading on the dyno

4897583 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
4897584 but i am afraid that just as the serpent deceived eve by his treachery your minds may be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to christ
4897585 after all these conferences books tapes impartations and manifestations im no different maybe there is something wrong with me because everyone else talks about how powerful their relationship with god is i just need to really pray and get committed
4897586 contend earnestly for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints
4897587 you can imagine how upsetting it was to see our glorious leader endorsing a concept wed been taught all our lives to fear
4897588 someone said they saw the foretold one wearing rose colored glasses and brandishing a peace sign
4897589 i want to be perfectly clear about the emperors views
4897590 it is written that the road to hell is paved with good intentions let it also be written that the road to war is paved with peace
4897591 his excellency most definitely was not brandishing a peace sign
4897592 what those minions saw today was the potentate sprouting a v for victory
4897593 the hand motion that once represented conquest has now been smeared and besmirched
4897594 once a glorious victorious symbol has been dragged in the mud reduced to an obscene hand gesture to turn heads and make ladies blush
4897595 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4897596 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4897597 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4897598 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4897599 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4897600 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4897601 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy

4897623 we need more officers and we are pulling every lever we can
4897624 a lot of my retirement plan hinges on the deployment cycle and the war on terror as it exists today
4897625 our loss rates are fairly stable and the growth is whats killing us
4897626 there is a tipping point that we have started to reach
4897627 there is a much larger percentage of officers planning to get out right at 20 years and once they are gone they are gone
4897628 we are overworked because of the shortages and have nothing to look forward to but another rotation to afghanistan or iraq so everything weighs towards getting out
4897629 as i look to the future i see the choices i am offered narrowing and the freedom of decision i had start to go away because of the shortages
4897630 i was originally scheduled to get my masters and go teach and that was derailed by deployments that window is gone for me now
4897631 the exodus is expected to continue as more officers are leaving sooner because of the strain multiple deployments are having on families
4897632 the army would prefer to promote officers at a lower rate to encourage high performance
4897633 if we can succeed here then we can succeed in other cities and hopefully new york city
4897634 whether e ha does it or not this is the future
4897635 i can text message to make a reservation so i dont waste time
4897636 what are we doing with fancy cell phones if it doesnt bring us information and give us choices and save us money
4897637 its like killing cockroaches but killing everything else too youre exterminating everything
4897638 i think awareness is pretty good now but were short of remedies
4897639 we need that sense of urgency for people to ask for coupons and then make sure they know how to use the converter boxes
4897640 were sort of at the last mile its the last most difficult households we need to reach to get information to them
4897641 for folks that havent gone the converter box route we encourage them to request coupons now and when they come in three weeks redeem them immediately to make sure the coupon doesnt expire
4897642 so your father disappears and you dont even want to know why interesting me ive always wanted to know who my real parents were
4897643 let me guess youre secretly a wizard who was raised by muggles
4897644 ok we have to explain this reference now now this one etc
4897645 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4897646 people are concerned about whether theres a bailout thats going to be coming from the u s so it would be logical to see foreign investors pull out of agency paper
4897647 they dont know whether the u s is going to be committed to supporting the gses and if they are going to support them by what methods are they going to support them
4897648 most fixed income investors to whom we have spoken believe that a capital infusion by the government into freddie and fannie is a prerequisite for turning sentiment around in mortgage backed securities and by extension in the broader fixed income markets
4897649 the longer the debate drags on the more tentative foreign interest in the sector is likely to become even though the gses are adequately capitalized investor confidence has been shaken
4897650 a slowdown in international investor interest remains the major risk factor for agency spreads in our view
4897651 were likely to see renewed flows into treasuries and perhaps some high quality u s corporates
4897652 it would take something dramatic for there to be a material improvement in the confidence necessary to bring foreign investment back to these agencies at the levels weve become used to
4897653 there is the hope thats held out by some for a magic bullet and that could take the form of a sizable infusion of capital or perhaps a complete rethink of restructuring both of these gses
4897654 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today
4897655 we wish chris nothing but the best and look forward to all that mike will do in a role in which he has excelled at for years
4897656 i think i need a little challenge in my life a little something different
4897657 i just felt at this point in time right now its time to try a little something different i think itll help the both of us in different ways
4897658 i know for many of you and for me and for dog this is a very sad occasion
4897659 thankfully we were able to be here all those years and become very much part of the fabric of this great city
4897660 when it came time to discuss contracts chris had some concerns and other interests the time had come for the show to end
4897661 were going to put together a new program have some new elements
4897662 i said id never have another partner and i wont
4897663 we havent had a good last six months but weve always been able to work together
4897664 i know what youre feeling because i feel it too
4897665 this show has been a major part of my life part of my heart for 19 years dont think for a second we havent loved every minute of it
4897666 aku nggak perlu klarifikasi apa apa apa yang salah dengan fotoku di pantai itu
4897667 an offensive term for people who are physically or mentally challenged
4897668 we zijn dolgelukkig dat michael erin is geslaagd dit record te evenaren phelps is een fenomenaal talent
4897669 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4897670 he said being rich should be defined by having a home and a prosperous and safe world without mentioning obama he said some want to increase taxes
4897671 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4897672 dit was een goede race ik heb alles goed gedaan misschien zit er gewoon niet meer in
4897673 ik heb wel vaker grote finales gezwommen en die ook gewonnen daar ligt het niet aan ik dacht dat ik wel in vorm was
4897674 ik was al erg blij dat ik deze finale mocht zwemmen
4897675 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4897676 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4897677 a temporary accommodation for amarnath yatris would not have altered the demographic structure of jammu amp kashmir state the agitation there is politically motivated to create a hindu muslim divide
4897678 we wanted to celebrate independence day by doing something meaningful our endeavour is to make people understand the true meaning of patriotism around 250 flags have been picked up so far all of them will be deposited at the collectors office where they will be destroyed as per rules
4897679 in shahpur and nehru bridge some commuters stopped their vehicles and helped us pick up the flags we plan to undertake this campaign every year to sensitize people
4897680 the common practice is to wave the flag while singing the national anthem and then dump it nearby most flags were found from crossroads and near dustbins
4897681 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4897682 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
4897683 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
4897684 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
4897685 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
4897686 at first we found little evidence that a terror training camp had been conducted there
4897687 the dogs sniffed this place just outside the farmhouse which was dug out
4897688 we are hoping to build an amusement park with international quality rides
4897689 the rides have not changed much over the last decade and there is need to bring something fresh and exciting for children
4897690 klfd is likely to be completed by this december the ring road will be open to public very shortly and be dotted with more than 3 000 trees
4897691 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4897692 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4897693 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4897694 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4897695 thats while i am having all these surgeries this year
4897696 pinjaman ptptn adalah untuk kemudahan semua rakyat malaysia jika pinjaman ini menggantikan pemberian biasiswa untuk pelajar melayu bumiputera maka hak keistimewaan orang melayu telah diketepikan
4897697 sekiranya ada pelajar melayu bumiputera yang berjaya ke universiti tetapi tidak memperolehi biasiswa bermakna perkara ini bertentangan dengan semangat dan hasrat yang termaktub dalam artikel 153 perlembagaan persekutuan mengenai hak keistimewaan orang melayu
4897698 oleh itu berilah kepada seberapa ramai pelajar melayu terutama dalam kursus profesional
4897699 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me
4897700 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
4897701 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of the constitution
4897702 this nomination should be based on the critera on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4897703 within the 30 day post operative period mortality was low and less than 10 per cent of patients experienced complications
4897704 patients who underwent the less common gastric bypass procedure were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of their operation
4897705 poses low short term risk in an otherwise high risk population
4897706 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol
4897707 this strong association suggests that strategies aimed at reducing smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy should target both behaviours

4897711 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4897712 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4897713 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4897714 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldn amp squo t get a worker there to pick the fruit
4897715 a little yes but tomorrow i can lose in the final so i have to keep going
4897716 today i think tommy was a little more tired than me and i played well i have won a lot of matches beat a lot of good players and got a lot of confidence
4897717 tomorrow is the most important match i have to play the final like it is my last
4897718 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4897719 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4897720 you cant get caught up on how a teams going good or bad
4897721 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
4897722 i dont think hes too worried about whos at the plate
4897723 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
4897724 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
4897725 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
4897726 hes been doing that for years when he stays healthy
4897727 the web site will be similar to a bridal registry only its where low income women list things they need for their babies
4897728 more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children
4897729 will remember that the eyes may be confused in two ways by a change from light to darkness or from darkness to light
4897730 and he will recognize that the same thing happens to the soul
4897731 i knew he could do it i just wanted the car to stay together joe gibbs is the best and joey is the best
4897732 this is a track you never been to before how do you prepare mentally before making your run
4897733 pretty much same as any other place wing it its one of those things just go out there and give it what its got the car was pretty good i was still a little bit loose in the corners i am not sure if that lap time will hold up or not

4897739 each annual visit to my hometown adds to my worries
4897740 on a windy day it makes more power than we need and it turns our electric meter backward
4897741 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4897742 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4897743 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4897744 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4897745 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4897746 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4897747 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4897748 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4897749 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4897750 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4897751 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4897752 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4897753 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4897754 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4897755 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4897756 the locks here arent to keep criminals out theyre to keep prying fingers out
4897757 theres a lot of exciting energy there are a lot of entrepreneurs as evidenced by your very vivacious flea market those are the things youre really going to want to protect and grow throughout the process
4897758 obviously the drugs are already illegal but where weve designated a drug free zone if somebody is found to be using drugs they can be excluded youre trespassing if you return to that area
4897759 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4897760 i cannot be in a room with a latex glove
4897761 id offer to help but i dont want to offend your masculinity
4897762 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4897763 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4897764 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4897765 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4897766 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4897767 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4897768 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4897769 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4897770 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4897771 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4897772 me entregu a fondo porque quer a la medalla y esa ansiedad por ganarla me hac a mirar todo el tiempo hacia atr s
4897773 sab a que era arriesgada la apuesta al arrastrar una lesi n pero si no hubiera participado y no hubiera llegado a la meta habr a sentido que todo el trabajo realizado este tiempo no habr a servido para nada
4897774 soy humilde y quiero dar las gracias a dios lo que l ha hecho por m en estos cuatro a os es much simo

4897776 caracas puede dejar de ser urbe y convertirse en una megal polis
4897777 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4897778 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4897779 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4897780 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4897781 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4897782 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4897783 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4897784 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4897785 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4897786 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4897787 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4897788 men just want to find a woman who will be faithful and be there for the children women want a man to support her and the children a provider and someone to be faithful as well
4897789 my position the senates position and everybodys position over here has been that we want to see what proposal comes from the hospitals about how to produce the 90 million they have always produced historically
4897790 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4897791 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4897792 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest
4897793 pakistans embattled president pervez musharraf as an enemy of islam in a first audio message in english posted online on saturday
4897794 in the message zawahiri also dismissed the pakistani army as a band of mercenaries controlled by the us administration
4897795 is the pakistan army an army defending muslims or merely a security service agency or a band of mercenaries which kills muslims to please its masters the neo crusaders in the white house he said in an apparent attempt to incite muslim pakistanis against the army
4897796 the jerk store called they said they ran out of you
4897797 are you from tennesee cause you are the only ten i see
4897798 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4897799 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4897800 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4897801 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4897802 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4897803 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4897804 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4897805 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4897806 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4897807 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4897808 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4897809 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4897810 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4897811 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4897812 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4897813 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4897814 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4897815 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4897816 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4897817 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4897818 show in the united kingdom that had been scheduled for today as well
4897819 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4897820 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4897821 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4897822 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4897823 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4897824 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4897825 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4897826 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4897827 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4897828 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4897829 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4897830 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4897831 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4897832 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4897833 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4897834 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4897835 who are open to doing something on the production side
4897836 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4897837 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4897838 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4897839 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4897840 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4897841 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4897842 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4897843 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4897844 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4897845 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4897846 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4897847 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4897848 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4897849 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4897850 i remain confident that aja is a capable and competent horror filmmaker in an age when they seem so far and few between but the man can only do so much with so little
4897851 its just pointless lacking in originality and prone to shooting itself in the glass theres a plethora of good through the mirror camera shots but they get overused and weak by the end
4897852 with aja slathering on the cheap boo scares overseeing rancid performances barely investing in his screenplay and showing questionable gorehound taste in violent imagery mirrors eventually reflects absolute tedium not appealing supernatural fury
4897853 nothing goes into the building besides you and your money
4897854 you dont need to wait for that red light to turn green cuz that wont happen
4897855 normally when you turn on or insert your battery you go into the pandoras recovery menu
4897856 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4897857 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4897858 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4897859 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4897860 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4897861 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4897862 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4897863 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4897864 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4897865 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4897866 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4897867 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4897868 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4897869 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4897870 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4897871 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4897872 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4897879 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4897880 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4897881 to live up to the new multicultural image of our metropolis
4897882 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4897883 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4897884 look mccain made it abundantly clear where he stands on the issue and what his policies will be were not answering anymore questions about it and feel we now can choose whoever would be most qualified as vp without answering for it because mccain has already proven his bonafides
4897885 tom ridge shouldnt be dismissed totally because hes pro choice
4897886 the hell with what i said to rick warren i really didnt mean it
4897887 im in charge and this is what i believe and tom joe or rudy as vp would have a sphere of influence on the issues they are most qualified to handle but dont worry ive made it clear that their selection would have zero influence on my social policy
4897888 we havent always lived for causes greater then our individual self interests
4897889 great now mitt can be co president and completely control our economic policy and maybe our foreign policy and come up with judicial appointments and speak for mccain and then mccain can do whats best for the country and step down just after his second year allowing mitt to take over and then run for 2 more full terms and serve for 10 years as the greatest leader in world history
4897890 we were great buddies and i hope he will continue to be like that
4897891 he came back to ireland on holidays a week before last we had a great time we played golf went to a few parties
4897892 he was a great son and hopefully he will remain one
4897893 hes obviously walked into something person or persons and a savage and brutal and cowardly attack occurred just at the intersection of kidman street near brook street

4897898 wed like to settle down start a family hopefully in a bigger house
4897899 i didnt care what happened i wasnt going anywhere without that book and i didnt it turned out later that was the only bible we had in the pow camp the good lord intervened at the last moment
4897900 i learned that when you want to get something done you dont start at the bottom
4897901 it was scary as the dickens chaotic with bodies everywhere shells exploding and small arms fire but there was no time to think we just did what we had to do its a good thing we trained so hard
4897902 i learned that even in war there can be some compassion that even the enemy can be human
4897903 i have been a free man for one week and my thankfulness to god is great i was a prisoner for 11 months this new testament i have had since 1935 it came to the army with me overseas in france in pow life and with me in my day of freedom and i have enjoyed sharing my testament with men more than anything else
4897904 it might be some considerably longer period of time to recover than has previously been forecast
4897905 its been 12 months and in some areas its actually worse than it was 12 months ago
4897906 theres pockets of activity around all over metro atlanta but theyre just pockets as far as we can determine when it comes to new residential construction all of north georgia is really flat on its back
4897907 and its really hard to build revenues when the market is so weak
4897908 we werent at the bottom and im not sure were at the bottom yet i dont think anyone knows for sure when the bottom is going to come but it does seem that were a whole lot closer to the bottom than we were
4897909 if we could do that every day id be happy
4897910 were doing better than we have in some of the previous months and i hope were seeing that the worst is now behind us
4897911 but i will say that this does seem to be a prolonged thing and maybe it wont be until late 2009 or even 2010 until we see strong demand for homes again
4897912 and i think were very fortunate in this area to have things like the new kia plant in our proximity
4897913 were in a good location in the path of progress and that progress will continue to run over us
4897914 its every part of the housing market thats getting whacked right now
4897915 pending home sales in the south have actually started to turn upward
4897916 thats a very positive sign because if we can start selling off some of these homes on the market and if we can start reducing the supply of homes then the housing prices will start to stabilize
4897917 ive started to see some investors go into housing because they believe its just so undervalued right now that they cant lose
4897918 so if investors are beginning to feel like they can make some money in it
4897919 our focus is on the creation of an outpatient diagnostic experience that provides the quality and convenience our community deserves
4897920 you told neighbors that four of the commissioners were supporting denial you shouldnt say things like that
4897921 i think so you said you couldnt talk to me about it
4897922 youve already got an empty save rite an empty chevron empty buildings up and down hwy 34
4897923 i will never sell that house weve had it up for sale forever now
4897924 all its going to do is just devalue the property
4897925 its enough to develop when you have all these empty buildings out here
4897926 whens it going to stop never until it goes all the way to meriwether county
4897927 how would you feel if it was beside your house
4897928 tatiana has good reasons to believe that having this business development built right next door to her would unfavorably alter the character of the neighborhood and her property
4897929 and dramatically lower the property value and precipitate a decline in the property values in manchester
4897930 it is an intrusion into the privacy and the solitude a person should be able to expect when they buy a home in a residential subdivision
4897931 all of her work and earned money is tied up in that house
4897932 will force tatiana to sell her house at a great loss no one will want to buy her house with a large commercial development right next door
4897933 it should not be allowed at the expense of tatiana and the other residents of the manchester subdivision
4897934 we have worked diligently with the county planning staff to come up with an agreeable solution that meets what we want to achieve and what the county is looking for
4897935 we feel like this is a vested rights case pretty plain and simple
4897936 it looks like some of the impact fees may be going to stuff that is not necessarily going to be done or needs to be done or is really specifically earmarked for what is necessary for additional development
4897937 obviously we dont want to get into attacking that ordinance and the whole thing because that would just be a waste of everybodys time effort and money
4897938 i think that is an issue youve got to consider
4897939 he punched their ticket without first checking where their bus was headed
4897940 the question of such benefits should not be allowed to cloud the discussion because in truth the movement for same sex marriage is less about such benefits than it is about societal acceptance and approval of homosexual relationships
4897941 es war uns sehr wichtig dass die samwers uns nicht nur finan
4897942 men just want to find a woman who will be faithful and be there for the children women want a man to support her and the children a provider and someone to be faithful as well
4897943 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4897944 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4897945 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4897946 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4897947 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4897948 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4897949 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4897950 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4897951 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4897952 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4897953 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4897954 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4897955 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4897956 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4897957 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4897958 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4897959 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4897960 to be honest i want to take some time out and think about what i do next
4897961 i want to make the right choice for the next eight to 10 years
4897962 the no 1 priority is the establishment of a new state league

4897964 a good solid high quality community club structure would be a terrific structure for tasmanian football if we ever did have an afl team into the future

4897971 the biggest issue with umd was the lack of creating for a targeted demographic when we first launched it was a difficult sale i dont think its a big stretch to say that a 16 year old doesnt have a lot of discretionary income we were offering umds that were more expensive than dvds at the time and we want content that is in line with what the demo is asking for action and comedy not romantic dramas
4897972 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4897973 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4897974 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4897975 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4897976 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4897977 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4897979 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

4897981 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4897982 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4897983 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4897984 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4897985 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4897986 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4897988 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4897990 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4897991 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4897992 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4897993 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4897994 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4897995 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4897996 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4897997 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4897998 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4897999 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4898000 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4898009 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4898010 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

4898021 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4898022 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4898023 and ill tell you how you can get a copy of my exciting new guide how to alienate your way to a better you
4898024 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4898025 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4898026 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4898027 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4898028 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4898029 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4898033 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way

4898147 bank staff do go through training but im not going to discuss the nature of it
4898148 moneys not that important what is is everyone in the bank staying safe everyone whether employees or customers needs to go home safe and that means complying

4898150 look at the person if theres anything distinctive about them try to remember it
4898151 if you get a note that says dont hit any alarms dont give me any bait money youre better off not doing it its not worth getting harmed for
4898152 you have a robber in front of you can we vacate them out of the premises quickly we can by complying basically what youre hoping for at that point is you just want to be compliant and to be a good witness
4898153 the goal is to get him out of the bank we dont want to cause any kind of confrontation if he says put the money in the bag you put the money in the bag and send him on his way
4898154 i really cant give the details of what training is done
4898155 obviously we dont want to give any robbers tips on what to do or not do everybody is trained and the utmost concern is the safety of employees and customers

4898196 caused by blood clotting caused by factors related to taking the oral contraceptive pill
4898197 we want the precautions for the pill written on the outside of the pill packaging
4898198 we want youngsters to know how important it is to read the awareness notices
4898199 if we had read the pills directions more carefully maybe we would still have tanya here
4898200 my daughter wasnt a vain person but shed had acne for 13 years and just wanted to clear it up
4898201 she was smart the dux of her school and she was always the person who organised everyone else
4898202 extremely high risk of having a baby that is severely deformed
4898203 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
4898204 how much smut do you think you could put in a drabble
4898205 no it isnt its just a robot and its so cute do you think the doctor would let me keep one
4898206 whatever would y be wanting a robot for are you daft
4898207 the last thing we need is a talkin tea kettle in the tardis especially one like that
4898208 why the doctor could probably fix it so it isnt dangerous for us
4898209 an the sky is made of little green apples hell probably get us all shot tryin to take it apart
4898210 oh dont be silly hes perfectly competent with robotics you know that
4898211 jamie now youre just arguing for the sake of arguing i think theyre cute i want one to come with us
4898212 well yes dont you think it would make a grand pet
4898213 if the doctor wanted a wee robot pet he would get one he wouldve brought along a yeti
4898214 you could help me it could be a surprise for the doctor
4898215 a trap with what we havent so much as rope
4898216 no not that kind of trap its a robot not an animal if we could get one to run itself down we could just carry it
4898217 but they just come back up weve seen it they were a wavin their arms
4898218 so we need to keep it from moving its arms
4898219 fun you call riskin our lives over a talkin bucket fun a talkin bucket that could kill us at that now look the doctor said for us to stay here
4898220 and we will well come right back as soon as we catch us a quark i have an idea
4898221 you run along that ridge there theres plenty of boulders all you have to do it go from one to another the quarks master is out of sight now but itll still shoot at you
4898222 so you just jump along itll wear itself out hitting rocks and once it runs down well run down and get it before it can recharge
4898223 yes ive seen you climb youre very fast and youre faster at running than i am
4898224 no look jamie its out of energy its starting to recharge
4898225 oh all right but you promise me youll leave it lie if more of em come
4898226 all right as long as we come back well have to think of a name for it
4898227 jamie was just helping isnt it just the most adorable thing youve ever seen can we keep it doctor please
4898228 im sorry zoe i think its hardwired to be obedient to the dominators its a part of the power system it would be quite a bit of work to get it to listen to anyone else
4898229 well if we were to replace the power but then it would need manual recharging to remain useful possibly every day
4898230 just let me keep it pleeeease its just a little one
4898231 it would need to be disarmed and it might still have some discharge problems might not be necessarily dangerous but it could be a little messy
4898232 ill take care of any messes ill fix anything it breaks i promise
4898233 goodness zoe have you developed an affection for it its only a robotic device you realize that
4898234 ill keep it in my room if you want you wont even know its there
4898235 bad quark bad bad bad oh dear oh dear look at this mess dribbling little energy bolts all over my brand new transtechtricometer zoe zoe your quark is out you left the door open again oh drat that girl promises promises
4898236 this sites purpose is to bring to light a lot of issues that linux users run into that they shouldnt run into issues that occur for both experienced and new linux users it also focuses somewhat on issues that severely need attention in order for the linux desktop gnome kde etc to become as much as it can be we are not against linux quite the contrary but we are over the misinformation lies and downright idiocy that surrounds and impedes the progress of a lot of linuxs desktops applications and subsystems

4898247 i have been very interested in the discussion around menopausal rage last weeks response from the doctor wife and mother i believe lacked understanding it was like telling a depressed person to snap out of it
4898248 i have been through menopause and was also surprised by the rage that overwhelmed me

4898282 the lips of your pussy are chubby the hair is like brushed away from the cleft and looks neatly trimmed its not gothic baroque or gaudy but the classic type i believe if i will relate it to aesthetic art
4898283 oh shut up rudy youre making me feel too self conscious
4898284 will you finger your clit to me so i will know how to manipulate it
4898285 yeah go down on me now i wanna feel your tongue now there and dont forget to play my nipples
4898286 rudy im coming oh shit this is driving me insane this is it oh oh oh arrrrghhhhhhhhh debbie wails in ecstasy her hips rocking back and forth as waves and waves of pleasure lap her body and soul

4898294 pop with your best shot give it all to me rudy woody come to debbie pop it all to me
4898295 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4898296 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4898297 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4898298 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4898299 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4898300 what tourist office needs their workers to stay after midnight
4898301 theyre probably making and shipping out tons of cutting edge cocaine from their lair
4898302 theyve just expanded now and got on new staff to make sure the police dont catch on
4898303 course i do its going to be my trade but listen to you two a suit and a little good tipping and suddenly theyre alright how gullible can you be
4898304 they called for this awhile ago bloody oven here its on credit
4898305 we built the lodge for the type of guest whether a family couple or sole adventurer looking for a one of a kind experience our facilities services and design reflect our natural forest location botanical gardens beautiful mountain environs and of course our 27 rescued and rehabilitated sumatran elephants although we provide all the modern day luxury comforts a stay at the elephant safari park lodge is more about the interactive elephant experience
4898306 i guess i would say a stay at the lodge is like a five star luxury camping experience
4898307 everything in our lodge rooms from interior finishes to the lodges artworks and soft furnishings are custom made and elephant inspired hand dyed regal blue and gold bed runners embroidered with elephant insignia bedside lamps with elephant motifs artworks created by the parks own elephant artisans even the legs of the beds are carved to resemble elephant feet
4898308 even if the translation circuit was working itd be a mystery ive just one more part to find you can explore on your own if you like perfectly safe here
4898309 oh yes the mantii are known for their passivity makes bargaining easy
4898310 i think i spotted some jewelry a little further down the street very sparkly
4898311 come and get me if you need to i should only be a few minutes anyway
4898312 dont go an eat that rainbow candy floss without me
4898313 its heavier your accent almost french are you doin that on purpose
4898314 you cant possibly wander off and find trouble well technically you already did but this situation is clearly preventative of any further dilemmas i should be thanking them for keeping an eye on you
4898315 honestly you should be honored they picked you for whatever ritual this is dependent on
4898316 doctor this is the one situation when id forgive you for lookin specially if it means you dont burn me with that screwdriver
4898317 its just very um sturdy rope rose not your household variety and these these are particularly good knots best knots ive seen in oh a very long time very um tight
4898318 rose um weve got to move before that guard comes back he has a spear and i for one dont want to find out how sharp it is
4898319 find your way back to the tardis ill be there soon as i can
4898320 best i can do right now rose now come over here so i can lift you
4898321 youre not sendin me off into that jungle alone thats just as dangerous as stayin wyou
4898322 more of a dense forest really climates not warm enough to be a jungle
4898323 yeah i remember then i ended up naked and tied up as some sorta offerin
4898324 ill find somethin for you to grab onto i can pull you out and then well
4898325 in any case the nature and views of bali remain interesting for those seeking investments in the tourism sector

4898330 it is also handy for windows xp home edition users where the group policy tool is not available so making precise security settings is difficult
4898331 people are not going to be eager to pay over a grand just to use adobe software not to mention the extra space in their offices
4898332 oh well you can use xx instead or it runs under wine with a bunch of patches and then some features dont work
4898333 but more companies would start to accept linux since its a free os
4898334 maybe we could have a go at doing this and maybe we could be better

4898338 i finally made it here sorry about the wait 30 years or something
4898339 only took you 30 minutes to forgive me for not coming
4898340 perths great but its halfway round the fucking world if you moved it closer to england more people would come here
4898341 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4898342 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4898343 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4898344 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4898345 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4898346 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4898347 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4898348 my idea of heaven tastes like a trevisana from fornino
4898349 the only place you can get such a slice yadda yadda yadda
4898350 came here for a friends birthday and really didnt know what to expect
4898351 oh i guess i must have forgotten to write that down do you still want them
4898352 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol
4898353 this strong association suggests that strategies aimed at reducing smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy should target both behaviours
4898354 within the 30 day post operative period mortality was low and less than 10 per cent of patients experienced complications
4898355 patients who underwent the less common gastric bypass procedure were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of their operation
4898356 poses low short term risk in an otherwise high risk population
4898357 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4898358 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4898359 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4898360 mommy i love you so much when i grow up i want to marry you in six years when im all grown up
4898361 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4898362 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it
4898363 for a minute there it was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that
4898364 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4898365 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4898366 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4898367 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4898368 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4898369 cuando le quebr el saque mi entrenador me dijo tommy luce m s cansado que vos as que trat de aprovechar eso y jug puntos m s largos

4898372 we had to employ a special effects man to go through every frame clearing up their complexions
4898373 this is a celebration of the feast day of the assumption of the virgin mary and of course the ethnicity and the greek culture because its something to be proud of
4898374 this began 81 years ago as a picnic to celebrate the feast and it grew into a community event thats become essential to the church greek orthodox is a minority religion and the festival is for people to celebrate the religion culture and heritage
4898375 the dance troupe is a group that brings the kids in because we have three age groups it brings the children into become a part of their community
4898376 with the economy the way it is i thought it was a good opportunity to introduce families
4898377 it costs around twenty nine dollars to get into a theme park a friend of mine was telling me he paid ninety dollars just to park in boston so the economy is excluding families as they wait in anticipation to heating costs this winter we just wanted to offer them a fun alternative this summer so they dont feel like this missed anything
4898378 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4898379 would you want to know if the most horrific attack on your country was perpatrated by its own government would you really want to know
4898380 made by the wachowski brothers and joel silver of matrix fame
4898381 we can be sure that the wachowski brothers were referencing the order out of chaos system since at one point in the film the opressive english parliment gets frustrated that their society is embracing the terrorist acts against them and decides to begin committing terrorist acts under the guise of v in order to turn the people against him and again embrace their oppressive form of government police state they even unleash a biological virus on their people in the film killing almost 100 000 people and if the history of terrorism in literature and cinema is any indicator you should probably mind your hygeine habits in the coming years because as exhibited below several times in recent years terrorist acts have been depicted almost exactly as they go down in entertainment sold to us beforehand
4898382 as for anyone who scoffs at the notion that government connected interests could be planting depictions of terrorism in hollywood that isnt the allegation the more realistic notion is that such interests have been made privy to certain plotlines and then decide to preempt them in real life to affect how you see their portrayal upon release of the entertainment material
4898383 but perhaps that is the desired goal by the powers that be to push americans until they fight back and really give you a pretext to lay on the police state thick since the outcome of another staged attack like 9 11 really cannot be gauged considering the growth in the population who are not so sure 9 11 is what they thought it was anymore if an attack were to occur tomorrow i dont believe theyre certain they can sell us on their version of it and i believe that scares them
4898384 enjoy life by getting with lots of women before he settles down
4898385 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4898386 instead of giving these two dedicated law enforcement officers the heroes treatment
4898387 you may disagree with me but i believe the legal action taken against these border patrol veterans was the bush administrations way of sending a message to all us border patrol agents dont do your jobs if you do youll be punished
4898388 this reminds me of the incidents when cops who did their jobs protecting and serving the people of new york would be singled out for punishment harassment and loss of their jobs
4898389 the message in the compean ramos case seems to be do your jobs and youll be punished ignore illegal aliens violating us laws and youll be rewarded with pay increases promotions and other goodies by cynical political leaders who favor an unbridled invasion of the us by millions of illegal aliens
4898390 how is it that our political leaders tell americans they are do everything possible to secure our borders and protect our sovereignty yet they hide and disregard reports of incursions by mexican military and police personnel suspected of providing protection for drug and human traffickers
4898391 in the compean ramos case the federal government actually punished law enforcement officers for attempting to stop an incursion by a drug trafficker the american people are being lied to by government officials while at the same time being placed in harms way since many of these incursions are perpetrated by armed mexicans

4898396 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4898397 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4898398 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4898399 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4898400 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4898401 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4898402 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4898403 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4898404 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4898405 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4898406 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4898407 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4898408 we told the world this is about starting an invasion we screamed to the world stop it
4898409 and the definition of an international mechanism which will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the agreement on the ground
4898410 resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4898411 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4898412 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4898413 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4898414 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4898415 we saw that many of the reactions of the russian army in georgian territory are exceeding the boundaries of international law
4898416 better keep yourself clean and bright you are the window through which you must see the world
4898417 you dont drink you dont smoke youve never done drugs you dont have any tattoos or piercings and you wont sleep with me charming no youre going to turn into a beam of light
4898418 it goes to 11 and stonehenge notwithstanding of course not that i didnt like t

4898421 we see an epidemic that is growing in black america a half a million black americans are infected with hiv and 50 percent of all new hiv diagnoses in the us are black aids in america today it can be argued is a black disease no matter how you look at it through the lens of gender sexual orientation age social economic class level of education a region of the country where you live black people bear the brunt of the aids epidemic we are 30 percent of the new cases among gay men 40 percent of the new cases among men in general 60 percent of the new cases among women and 70 percent of the new cases among youth
4898422 we are very concerned that the growing epidemic in america which is largely an epidemic in black america seems to be taken for granted or left behind in the united states this report draws important parallels between the two epidemics the global and the domestic for example infection rates in some communities in black america are as high as some parts of africa and more black americans are infected with hiv than the total populations of people living with hiv in seven of the 15 countries served by pepfar presidents emergency plan for aids relief yet the us response to aids in black america stands in sharp contrast to our national response to the epidemic overseas
4898423 as in africa hiv in the us takes a tremendous toll on black women african american women are 23 times more likely than white women to be diagnosed with aids many black women in the united states are more vulnerable to hiv because of gender inequity and black women can often not insist on abstinence or use of condoms because of fear of violence or other emotional trauma that occurs with trying to get their partners to reduce their risk of exposure to hiv

4898489 para salafus shaleh berdoa selama 6 bulan agar mereka disampaikan hingga bulan ramadhan dan kemudian berdoa pasca ramadhan selama 6 bulan agar ibadah mereka diterima
4898490 diantara doa yang dibaca oleh para salaf adalah ya allah selamatkan aku hingga bulan ramadhan dan karuniakan aku ramadhan dan terimalah ibadah ibadahku pada bulan ramadhan
4898491 telah datang kepada kalian bulan ramadhan bulan yang penuh berkah yang telah didalamnya diwajibkan bagi kalian berpuasa disitu allah membuka pintu pintu syurga dan menutup pintu pintu neraka serta para syaitan diikat didalamnya ada sebuah malam yan lebih mulia dari seribu malam barang siapa yang diharam dihalangi untuk mendapatkan kebaikan malam itu sesungguhnya ia telah diharamkan dari segala kebaikan
4898492 hadits ini merupakan landasan agar kaum muslimin saling memberikan selamat dengan datangnya bulan ramadhan
4898493 ketahuilah bahwa puasa terbagi dalam 3 tingkatanyaitu puasa umum puasa khusus dan puasa khususil khusus
4898494 tingkatan kedua orang puasa adalah yang puasa di dunia ini karena karena allah maka ia menjaga kepala dan apa yang dibawahnya menjaga perut dan apa yang di sekelilingnya dan mengingat mati serta pasca kematian orientasi hidupnya akherat maka hari iednya adalah hari bertemu dengan rabnya dan hari kebahagiannya adalah hari ketika ia melihat rabnya
4898495 apabila kalian sedang berpuasa janganlah berkata dengan perkataan kotor keji dan janganlah melakukan perbuatan bodoh berteriak mencela apabila ada orang yang menghina katakan kepadanya bahwa saya sedang puasa
4898496 barangsiapa yang tidak meninggalkan perkataan dan perbuatan bohong maka allah tidak menperdulikan ibadah puasanya
4898497 sesungguhnya allah tidak mengubah keadaan sesuatu kaum sehingga mereka mengubah keadaan yang ada pada diri mereka sendiri

4898511 it felt pretty good but there were definitely some situations where we couldve done better
4898512 thats what the preseason is all about where you go out and keep learning then you come out stronger in the regular season
4898513 we still have miles to go and we have to put pieces together
4898514 but i like the progress we made tonight and i hope we can build on that
4898515 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4898516 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4898517 do i win a empty paperbag or something of that sort
4898518 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4898519 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4898520 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4898521 the other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development
4898522 of course pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine
4898523 it costs on average 550m and takes more than 10 years to bring each new treatment to patients
4898524 naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price
4898525 we were good but i thought the opposition kicked their way out of it a bit
4898526 i didnt think we were the better team tonight necessarily but we were around the mark
4898527 to actually generate a win from a trailing margin then to hold on to it for the last few minutes i think was pretty good for their self confidence
4898528 we should have been five goals up at halftime and we should have put them away and good sides do that but to brisbanes credit they willed themselves over the line in the last quarter and probably wanted it a bit more than we did
4898529 we dont test anyone in the middle of the night for pleasure
4898530 but we have our intelligence and if theres a suspicion we will do it we have done it
4898531 we wanted to clean up the field of play before any athletes got to the games and i think weve been pretty successful
4898532 even though the cheats and their retinue have the same background as us we can now detect all known substances
4898533 we have to scare these athletes and we have to shame them they have to know we are right there with them we know what they are doing and we are going to catch them
4898534 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
4898535 theyve tested me four times here theyre taking so much blood ill be weak for the final
4898536 the first cheater was adam when he took an apple

4898539 but its not for some governments whose countries are facing disease natural disasters war for these countries they have bigger issues to fight

4898547 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4898548 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4898549 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4898552 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

4898562 waah something isnt doing what i want it to i think ill sue yeah
4898563 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
4898564 the most that can be done is autonomy it should be done within the framework of the constitution national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of the philippines
4898565 this was understandable because when the north cotabato officials filed their petition they were not yet given a copy of the moa thus their lawyers were unable to question the unconstitutionality of its provisions
4898566 beyond their constitutional authority and jurisdiction and represents a grave abuse of discretion amounting to a lack of jurisdiction
4898567 the moa is blatantly injurious to intervenors who are citizens of the republic of the philippines eroding as it does the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the philippine state
4898568 the peace panel exercised powers beyond its constitutional authority effectively ceding the entire muslim palawan sulu geographical territory to the milf and creating within that region a state separate and distinct from the republic
4898569 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
4898570 the moa ad is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was an appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed
4898571 the moa violates many provisions of the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4898572 its impossible that government lawyers wont be able to answer questions about the moa since they prepared it
4898573 in creating this moa the peace panel knew the people wouldnt accept the agreement if consultations were held in the same way they know they would be unable to argue their case in the supreme court hence the resort to delaying tactics dalawa lang ang isyu dito ang kakulangan ng konsultasyon at constitutionality
4898574 the moa should not be forced down our throats the credibility of this peace pact is now highly suspect with malaca ang pressing for cha cha along with it and the flawed exclusive process undertaken to have the agreement
4898575 because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions
4898576 what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4898577 will result in a diminution of philippine sovereignty as it empowers its juridical creation to enter into economic agreements and trade relations with foreign countries to open trade missions abroad and to participate in meetings of the asean and un specialized agencies where only sovereign states take part
4898578 be a good deterrent to terrorism good for security and would help spur economic development in mindanao
4898579 i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corps of the philippines
4898580 pure speculations reports that the us plans to build military bases in mindanao the reason for its strong support for the peace process
4898581 i have a very honest answer no we do not have plans to have military bases in the philippines not in mindanao not anywhere

4898596 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4898597 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget mr swan said

4898686 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4898687 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4898688 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4898689 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4898690 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4898691 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed

4898750 in order to understand why our economy has behaved differently since the middle of 1960s than it has earlier in the post world war ii epoch we have to appreciate how the broad contours of the financial structure have changed the changes in the broad contours of demand have changed the reaction of aggregate profits to a change in investment and therefore have changed the cyclical behavior of the ability of business to validate its debts the changes in the financial structure have increased the proportion of speculative and ponzi finance in the total financial structure and therefore increased the vulnerability of the financial system to refinancing and debt validating crises
4898751 a thorough research study should examine the changing composition of the assets and liabilities of the various sectors and the implications of this changing structure as well as changes in financing terms for the cash flows of the various sectors of the economy the cash flow structure due to liabilities need then be integrated with the cash flow from assets and the various cash flows due to income production in particular the changing relations between cash receipts and payment obligations and between payment obligations and the margin of safety need be understood
4898752 the combined effects of big government as a demander of goods and services as a generator through its deficits of business profits and as a provider to financial markets of high grade default free liabilities when there is a reversion from private debt means that big government is a three way stabilizer in our economy and that the very process of stabilizing the economy sets the stage for a subsequent bout of accelerating inflation
4898753 innovations in financial practices are a feature of our economy especially when things go well but each new instrument and expanded use of old instruments increases the amount of financing that is available and which can be used for financing activity and taking positions in inherited assets increased availability of finance bids up the prices of assets relative to the prices of current output and this leads to increases in investment in our economy it is useful to distinguish between hedge and speculative finance hedge finance takes place when the cash flows from operations are expected to be large enough to meet the payment commitments on debts speculative finance takes place when the cash flows from operations are not expected to be large enough to meet payment commitments even though the present value of expected cash receipts is greater than the present value of payment commitments
4898754 during a period of successful functioning of the economy private debts and speculative practices are validated

4898814 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4898816 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4898817 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4898818 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4898819 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4898820 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4898821 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4898822 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4898823 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4898824 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4898825 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4898826 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4898827 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4898828 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4898829 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4898830 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4898831 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4898832 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

4898844 la capacidad de los kirchner para crear problemas donde no los hay es notable
4898845 esto pas por seguir manejando la relaci n con venezuela desde el piso 11 del ministerio de econom a
4898846 el asunto con moreno es muy simple los kirchner creen todo lo que moreno les dice por lo tanto cuando moreno afirma que no hay inflaci n cristina y n stor no dudan ni por un instante de que sa es la verdad mart n lousteau durante su breve paso por el ministerio de econom a se enfrentaba con moreno el actual ministro no encima moreno es un soldado raso hace todo lo que los kirchner le ordenan sin chistar por lo tanto es muy dif cil que quieran desprenderse de l
4898847 los kirchner conf an en muy poca gente en ese pu ado est n de vido moreno zanini y alg n otro por eso no delegan tareas en sus ministros todo debe pasar por las manos del matrimonio presidencial el problema es que tanto la presidenta como el ex presdiente en funciones toman decisiones en reas t cnicas sin el debido conocimiento del tema y adem s basados en datos que muchas veces son err neos
4898848 la normalizaci n del indek va a tener sus consecuencias econ micas indudables no va a ser gratis
4898849 es verdad nadie del gobierno ni lo llama ni lo atiende a cobos
4898850 cada d a que pasa los kirchner lo quieren menos y si hubieran podido ya lo habr an echado
4898851 cobos sabe esto se cans del ninguneo y de ahora en m s no callar m s
4898852 a cobos no le preocupa tanto su suerte como la de sus correligionarios k es por eso que su objetivo es que el radicalismo los vuelva a aceptar en sus filas
4898853 se hubiera preocupado por eso antes de caer en la tentaci n de los kirchner la nica causa por la que el ingeniero cobos tendr a alguna posibilidad de reingresar al seno del radicalismo ser a si se decidiera a pasar lisa y llanamente a la oposici n ya que tras las elecciones de octubre pasado ese fue el papel que la ciudadan a le dio a la uni n c vica radical y sinceramente no queremos que eso suceda lo que deseamos es que cobos asuma la responsabilidad de su rol institucional y complete junto a la presidenta la totalidad de su mandato como vicepresidente con respecto a los radicales que lo acompa aron en esta aventura las condiciones son las mismas estamos cansados de sus ambig edades
4898854 kirchner estuvo astuto al actuar as efectivamente duhalde no tiene nada armado al d a de hoy pero est arm ndose

4898868 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4898880 with buying clothes and everything i dont know how i could have done it
4898881 it looks like we have more than the 800 children we had last year
4898882 as the donations kept coming in we just kept filling bags making them bigger and bigger
4898883 school supplies are very expensive and i might not have been able to buy them all at once
4898884 the main thing for us is we dont want any child to go to school lacking what they need
4898885 we want them to go to school and blend right in
4898886 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4898887 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4898888 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4898889 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4898890 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4898891 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4898892 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4898893 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4898894 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4898895 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4898896 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4898897 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4898898 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4898899 this is a planning took where all things are going
4898900 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4898901 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4898902 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4898903 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4898904 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4898905 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4898906 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4898907 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4898908 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4898909 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4898910 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4898911 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4898912 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4898913 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4898914 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4898915 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4898916 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4898917 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4898918 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4898919 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4898920 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4898921 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4898922 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4898923 it is private property and should they wish to develop or redevelop the land prior approval must be obtained from the state planning authority
4898924 being a mom means you get to be both god and the devil
4898925 i guess it wouldnt hurt anything for you to just look but we cant wake her up ok
4898926 oh chris shes so sexy i cant believe youre letting me see her like this

4898929 your understanding of his position and your knowledge of loan structures made the process so much easier
4898930 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4898931 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4898932 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4898933 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4898934 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4898935 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4898936 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4898937 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4898938 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4898939 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4898940 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4898941 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4898942 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4898943 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4898944 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4898945 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4898946 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4898947 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4898948 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4898949 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4898950 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4898951 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4898952 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4898953 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4898954 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4898955 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4898956 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4898957 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4898958 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4898959 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4898960 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4898961 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4898962 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4898963 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4898964 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4898965 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4898966 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4898967 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4898968 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4898969 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4898970 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4898971 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4898972 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4898973 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4898974 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4898975 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4898976 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4898977 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4898985 the jerk store called they said they ran out of you
4898986 are you from tennesee cause you are the only ten i see
4898987 it was a hard race for me in the second half i knew i had to get out fast it hurt me a bit at the back end its what i had to do to
4898988 i think i put more pressure on myself than anyone else i got a lot of support from my teammates
4898989 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4898990 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4898991 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4898992 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4898993 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4898994 i dont want to be saved i want to be spent
4898995 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4898996 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4898997 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4898998 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4898999 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4899000 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4899001 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4899002 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4899003 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4899004 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4899005 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4899006 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4899007 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4899008 you are exactly the person for the job you are gentle and the energy flows through you you are perfect for it youre probably just what she needs
4899009 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4899010 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4899011 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4899012 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4899013 the other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development
4899014 of course pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine
4899015 it costs on average 550m and takes more than 10 years to bring each new treatment to patients
4899016 naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price

4899029 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4899030 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban

4899038 it was a stupid move by him mohd saiful and what made it worse was that it involved those who use the name of islam
4899039 swearing on the quran is not in keeping with the demands of islamic law what we have in islam is lian swearing involving married couples swearing on the holy book is a practice of christians who swear on the bible
4899040 for muslims it is lian which is the case of a man accusing his wife of having illicit sex but anwar and mohd saiful are not husband and wife
4899041 why did he do it swear on the eve of the permatang pauh by election nominations it is clear that a dirty political game is being played
4899042 i believe in anwars innocence and i am confident more will vote for him after seeing all this happening
4899043 this swearing on the quran is not a laughing matter i think it is time for him anwar to respond perhaps in the same way
4899044 he must do it if he wants to clear his name

4899056 id check my sources a little stronger than you have before you publish this story
4899057 i dont know what asking a question proves that isnt proof of anything
4899058 this guy is the focus of broad ranging inquiries at the state level
4899059 i wouldnt be surprised if theyre asking questions about him
4899060 questions about bernard have little to do with the mayor

4899062 the big issue is whether the money that was paid was for kickbacks or legitimate compensation
4899063 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
4899064 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4899065 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4899066 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4899067 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4899068 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4899069 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4899070 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4899071 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4899072 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4899073 manager review is a dynamic and iterative process the due diligence never ends what we find amazing is the value added of a fohf manager is often put in doubt or the extra layer of fees determined as excessive and or unnecessary this is in our opinion a paradox on the one hand investors agree that seeing hundreds of hedge fund managers on a regular basis is important yet on the other hand they postulate that fohf managers do not add value who else is in the position of doing the due diligence other than experienced and prudent investment professionals who are in the loop of information flow the industry itself is opaque i e information does not flow efficiently and so scarce resources must be expended to find and analyze the information we doubt that the information advantage of a top quartile fohfs manager over a less informed investor will deteriorate
4899074 in single hedge fund strategies there is clearly an opportunity to generate stronger returns simply because it is a more focused type of strategy on the other hand there is more risk involved furthermore fohfs are supposed to have a high level of expertise as well as the ability to spread large amounts of assets over a number of hedge funds which limits risk so in exchange for slightly lower returns you are getting an entirely different risk profile
4899075 institutional investors are moving away from investing in three or four core hedge fohfs because of the overlap in their underlying portfolios institutions are replacing one or two of these core managers with specialty niche managers in order to diversify and improve performance
4899076 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple

4899080 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4899081 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4899082 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4899083 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4899084 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4899128 would you ever be my would you be my fucking boyfriend
4899129 but youre not duplicatable neither is what you do we cant afford that
4899130 im here youll take me if you want it doesnt matter my stuff was part of the world before i was born i did not come into the world i grew from it i am not separate from it and i shall go back into it when all is done and now i lay myself out on it onto myself and trust it will be ok
4899131 you know how things go with witney yes i do and all too well i have attempted projects before with him overly bright overly eager underly reliable with no developed sense of time do not wait for him to start ordering dinner
4899132 you mean why not just use plywood from home depot
4899133 well your jo average plywood you might get from home depot or your local lumber store that doesnt specialize is made to pretty much stay flat and look pretty on both sides but it generally is not waterproof which is not a huge concern for this because it is going to be covered with epoxy but it is not guaranteed to have totally filled cores the cores are not guaranteed to be high quality
4899134 so there are spaces inside sometimes voids or the plies dont quite meet
4899135 right there will often be a line where two pieces of the core material dont meet when you bend the wood because you make a kayak by forcing wood to bend in the shape of a kayak you take a piece of plywood and force it to curve to follow the hull what happens is you get a kink if you have a void in the core
4899136 so the plywood this place has is of a different quality
4899137 right marine plywood it is certified to a british standard called bs1088 that basically says it is going to be high quality faces its going to be the same material faces and cores not just whatever you happen to have laying around in the cores and the cores are going to be contiguous and free of voids
4899138 yup and wenge an african hardwood with a gorgeous light relief in the grain
4899139 yes a light mahogany the clear fir is a dimensional lumber we are planning on cutting into long thin strips to make the sheer clamps out of were also going to make the cockpit carlands which are the cockpit equivalent of sheer clamps theyre the part that goes between the visible combing and the deck and theyre up on the inside
4899140 now what is this about the hatch you were saying you asked about that and i have no idea how to answer
4899141 well it is possible to fit a hatch in either the fore of aft deck or both accessing the normally sealed off compartments fore and aft on my larger mill creek two person kayak i chose not to put hatches in because the deck is so pretty just the way it is on my longer thinner single kayak which has a much smaller cockpit area there will be a hatch fore and aft the aft cargo hatch will be quite large and the forward hatch will be of a moderate size
4899142 well it all depends on its intended use if its day trips no if it is limited over nighting no
4899143 i dont intend on taking it out over days at a time
4899144 ok then there is room in the cockpit for a bottle of water and such
4899145 oh yes much the cockpit is large enough for a camera a bag lunch use a dry bag those are usually made of pvc that has a roll down top that clips back on itself and keeps things from getting wet
4899146 notoriously unreliable get a drybag at any kayak store any outdoor store
4899147 so you know this guy named kayak jeff and before you take a boat out you bring it to him for a blessing
4899148 and you brought your first one to him and he gave a blessing to your hull
4899149 well in the most kayak way basically i am building a slightly modified long skinny single and he is a very experience kayaker who is also a certified instructor and he runs a kayak store called appropriately kayak jeff and he came over last night to my moms where all this is being built and looked over the shape of the hull and the curvature of the bottom and said this is good thats the blessing
4899150 so i want to know im not going to play twirly games in the water
4899151 youre describing a fulcrum im not sure how that applies to this youd think having a fulcrum would make turning easier
4899152 well actually im describing center of gravity what im saying is if you put the friction at the ends of the arm what you are effectively doing with a boat hull of this shape is your center of rotation is the center line of the boat it is very low because you are sitting low in the hull you are actually sitting on the lower hull and the deeper the boat goes up to a certain point the greater its resistance to turning of course once you go so low the entire boat is covered by water there is no more resistance to turning
4899153 but i wish to not cover the entire boat with water i want to be clear on that i dont want to build a submarine
4899154 thing for shock value when i was really just trying to hook up with a non black sista cause i thought she was good people and got played
4899155 lol but i got that feeling from mexicans sometimes although mexican dudes hit on me sometimes i cant honestly recall seeing many or at all any mexican and african american couples i only met one guy who was of the two mixed

4899170 it was really tough and i knew that before i came here i would have liked to have gone quicker but ive got to recover for the 10k
4899171 that will be a different challenge and a tough test and im looking forward to it
4899172 i had expectations for the 400m freestyle but this is a great surprise
4899173 i felt good in the first 400m of this race and at the 800m and 900m i started believing that i could win

4899178 no p quer a habilidade ser o principal fator de sucesso a longo prazo
4899179 existem jogadores que ganharam torneios mundiais diversas vezes consecutivas em competi es com mais de 3 mil pessoas cada uma n o existe sorte que leve a tal fato
4899180 se legalizarmos os jogos de azar no brasil vamos fazer do pa s o para so da contraven o
4899181 acredito que qualquer tipo de jogo em que se aposta dinheiro e perde crime
4899182 o estado pratica livremente a es de jogo de azar que dependem exclusivamente da sorte em que se aposta dinheiro e t m potencial de desenvolver o v cio se assim creio que deveria haver uma atividade similar junto iniciativa privada
4899183 considerando a interpreta o da lei essas casas estariam sujeitas a ser autuadas especialmente levando em conta a interpreta o do minist rio p blico que bem legalista e restrita e afirma que qualquer a o dessas institui contraven o e est sujeita at mesmo a uma den ncia penal aos donos e aos clientes
4899184 fui l para investigar uma suspeita de explora o de jogos de azar
4899185 a iniciativa privada pode fazer aquilo que a lei n o pro be e como n o existe uma legisla o clara a respeito do assunto relatei aos meus superiores que n o havia crime no local
4899186 quando comecei a ter sucesso no esporte muitas outras oportunidades se abriram para mim por meio do meu blog e do portal isso fez com que eu pudesse ter receitas extras al m das minhas viagens para torneios e o jogo em si

4899232 we are constantly encountering various problems with the georgian side and it will depend how quickly and effectively this problem will be solved

4899238 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it

4899242 you press a button like a doorbell or a wireless button and that activates it
4899243 most people turn the hot water on and go and do something else while they are waiting brush their teeth or whatever
4899244 by the time theyve gotten back theyve let hot water go down the drain
4899245 i was incorrectly thinking im going to turn my faucet on and have all this hot water instantly
4899246 this is just one shower and my daughter takes about 50 showers
4899247 the master bath is on the other side of the house from where the water heater now is
4899248 it took forever to get hot water there i dont know how many gallons i wasted but i didnt like hearing that water running and waiting and waiting and waiting

4899261 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4899262 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4899263 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4899264 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4899265 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4899266 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4899267 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4899268 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change

4899280 we were determined to bring the very best forthcoming games to the showdown and weve certainly achieved that with left 4 dead were hugely excited to be able to show it to pc gamer showdown attendees as were sure its going to be one of the top games of 2008 and live up to valves fearsomely high standards
4899281 left 4 dead is a new type of co operative action experience one that must be played to truly appreciate were delighted to work with lg and the folks at one of our favourite gaming magazines to put on the first public exhibition of l4d in britain we hope the attendees of the show find the game as exciting as we do and we look forward to meeting folks there and giving away a few l4d prizes

4899292 a red wine drinks better at a little cooler temperature
4899293 well thats fine if you dont live in zimbabwe room temperature varies depending on where you are and the heat in someones home
4899294 a lot of people think they dont like red wines or that they are harsh but what theyve done is its at room temperature and its causing the sensation of burning in the throat
4899295 one of the mistakes a lot of people do is they try to get wine too cold
4899296 you dont want them to be icy cold because it shuts down the flavor its almost like drinking ice water because its ice cold and you dont taste any of the wonderful nuances
4899297 i think anytime you introduce your hot little hands around the bowl of the glass you are increasing the temperature of the wine and from aesthetics you are also adding fingerprints and we dont want that

4899355 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4899356 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4899357 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4899358 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4899359 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4899360 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4899361 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4899362 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4899363 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live

4899365 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4899366 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4899367 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4899382 ronald weasley what a pleasure it is to see you again please come in come in dont linger on the doorstep dont tell me youve come to buy another oh my dear boy whats happened
4899383 that must be very painful for you for both of you how is harry bearing up
4899384 its likely hes in pain as well but putting on a brave face he is rather guarded after all isnt he
4899385 id be surprised if harry hasnt learnt to hide his emotions from some very painful lessons be grateful that you can still cry
4899386 and pray that the day never comes when you run out of tears believe me there are few things more painful than needing to cry but being unable to do so
4899387 i dont even know why im bothering you with this
4899388 dont be sorry and far from being bothered i am honoured that you felt you could confide in me
4899389 no i will not buy that ring back from you
4899390 ill ill throw it into the lake the fucking squid can have it
4899391 its not for me to tell you what to do with your property
4899392 i would however beg you to reconsider things might not be as dire as they appear right now perhaps you should talk to harry again
4899393 i know what hed say just keep the ring mate everything will be fine well it wont be fine and i cant even stand looking at this thing anymore
4899394 though im always happy to see you i wish this time it could be under better circumstances

4899396 because i want to be here to tell my side of it
4899397 and i think im capable of telling both sides thank you
4899398 but somehow i always come out looking like an insensitive prick oh sorry peridot
4899399 weve been alone and we cant agree on anything i want you to hear this and tell us who you think is right
4899400 i think you might be the perfect person to tell ron what a prat hes being maybe hell listen to you he sure as hell wont listen to me
4899401 you start talking sense and ill listen to you all day
4899402 clearly i understand less about the situation than i thought maybe one of you could enlighten me then perhaps id be in a position to help
4899403 though i fear i may be out of my depth well never know however unless youre willing to confide in me a bit more
4899404 now we wont be interrupted all right ron why dont you tell me everything
4899405 shut the feckin window ya freak its like the feckin antarctic in here

4899411 hell it looks like im the only one in the whole bloody castle who doesnt know
4899412 i know what youre going to say and well talk about it after breakfast
4899413 but you both know right that if you ever want to talk about well about
4899414 i was coming back from the room of requirement well from trying to get into the room of requirement
4899415 i crossed paths with zabini and a few other slytherins
4899416 because i wasnt sure and i didnt want to worry you until i found out it was pretty obvious when we walked into breakfast this morning though
4899417 this is going to be really hard on you ron
4899418 uh your mum your dad ginny your brothers the twins
4899419 can you imagine what the twins would say if they found out or rather what they will say when they find out

4899428 you dont need people advertising the fact that youre that you fancy blokes youre too famous everybody knows you
4899429 you said i should correct you if you got it wrong
4899430 its all right ill admit i had the wrong idea at first but i think i have a pretty clear picture now
4899431 im not surprised youre both feeling a bit hot under the collar you do realize though that youre not angry with one another right
4899432 but you wouldnt listen to reason harry i cant let you do this to yourself not for me
4899433 ron youre the only one i would do it for
4899434 besides who says im doing it just for you its for me too ron i love you i need you you say im famous and all that rubbish but i dont care about any of that
4899435 cant you get it through that red mop of yours that i dont care the prophet can print my picture on the front page with a huge headline the chosen ones a fairy and all id care about was whether or not theyd spelt your name right in the article
4899436 im not sure it was harry who wasnt listening to reason ron
4899437 you were just worried about me im supposed to be angry about that then i reckon im daft because i just love you more than ever
4899438 im done seeking my keeper ron because id never find a better one and because im not a total idiot

4899448 but we wouldnt want to inconvenience mr sardonyx any longer
4899449 and was there anything else i could do for you today
4899450 and were sorry if we chased away any of your business
4899451 this has merely been customer service on a previous purchase may i assume you still find your rings satisfactory
4899452 what do you say do you want to keep your ring
4899453 i thought there might have been a problem but it looks like i was wrong sorry if i wasted your time peridot
4899454 i couldnt imagine a better use of my time or my shop and please remember that both are at your disposal if ever the need arises
4899455 that well be taking you up on that if nothing else we might be looking for a place to hide from time to time
4899456 a safe harbour perhaps again if i can provide that service i promise you my hospitality and my best manners
4899457 and speaking of manners where are mine i completely forgot to ask if youve fully recovered from your quidditch mishap harry it looked quite painful
4899458 professor dumbledore invited me after ron had told him id like to see a match im sorry you were under the weather that day ron i would very much have liked to have seen you play keeper even if it was against my own former house

4899461 you have one another much can be endured when you have the right person at your side i know you must be afraid right now but most of those who might deride you are those who have never experienced the depth of feeling you two share nor i imagine are they likely to be as strong as either of you and wouldnt stand a chance against you both never let anyone tell you that your love is wrong not when you so clearly belong together you have love and youth and as ive recently been reminded that is a formidable combination
4899462 and im inclined to believe it having now been so informed by two such clever young men

4899482 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension mr swan told abc television
4899483 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4899484 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget mr swan said

4899492 well only take steps forward and give ourselves a chance to win this game means were 4 0 a statement game i dont know
4899493 we knew what they were capable of and they did it at will
4899494 they set the tone from the first minute and we could not regroup it was very frustrating to be out there and not be able to regroup well put this behind us and hopefully will see them again
4899495 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
4899496 where have you guys been i sent seamus down here to drag your arses up to the dorm ages ago i have food and firewhiskey
4899497 sorry about that we got distracted discussing plays we havent seen shay though he never made it down here
4899498 i was occupied but i heard a noise when you came in and dean made me suspicious with his questions also you havent been able to look me or harry in the eye in weeks and your normal stash of porn is missing i think you must have some more interesting visuals to use for wank material
4899499 shay you really need to pay attention this is a one time offer and based on the way you have been looking at us the past few weeks you really want to take it
4899500 harry and i have a good relationship built on trust and love he has been the responsible one all of his life so a part of our relationship is me taking care of him basically what harry wants harry gets
4899501 right now harry is ridiculously turned on with the thought that someone was watching us without his knowledge of who it was and he wants it to happen again he wants to be blindfolded while i make his body sing and someone else watches i havent told him that you were the one watching but since we havent heard about it around the school he figures you must be somewhat trustworthy i told him that i would try to track our mystery voyeur down and here we are
4899502 remember that our relationship is all about trust he trusts me to take care of him you will not touch harry in any way you will have a spell to change your voice so that he cant recognize you but other than a few words to let him know you are there you will not speak you can touch yourself and you can even come but this is all about harry do you think you can handle this arrangement
4899503 hello it is certainly my pleasure to be here this evening
4899504 harry you know that you were to receive punishment tonight for previous actions
4899505 harry and i discussed our situation and he left the decision up to me as to whether you would witness all of the punishment not just the cock ball decorations and gag ive always been fair and part of that fairness is to give punishments when required or not to give them at all in light of that
4899506 due to your inability to speak you will get double the normal punishment for well you know
4899507 dont worry love youve come a long way from mushrooms in the forest
4899508 im sure itll be all over the prophet if i do anything too exciting id rather just stay at home no fuss
4899509 yeah theres just been a lot of work to do at the office thats all
4899510 well well have to make sure you have fun tonight
4899511 ron hasnt finished getting the place ready yet so i have to make you wear this before you come in
4899512 is that okay its not pressing on your glasses too much is it can you see anything
4899513 weve only done it this way so that we can make sure youre listening to us to make sure you understand you cant keep avoiding this harry avoiding us
4899514 fine if you want me to say it out loud then ill say it
4899515 ron is finding it a little difficult to believe me but we know that im not the one you want am i
4899516 i love ron i love him enough to give him what he needs and i know he needs you
4899517 i dont think you understand harry i know ron loves me but he loves you too and because its you im willing to share him weve discussed it a lot and weve decided that this is the best thing for everyone
4899518 maybe not in the same way that i love ron or he loves you but i do and i know that you feel the same i know that it would make everybody happy if you were a part of this the three of us weve been together for a long time why should this be any different
4899519 first you can watch us harry we know how much you enjoy it
4899520 i dont think youre the only one who enjoys you watching us harry
4899521 look at how much he wants this how much he wants you
4899522 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4899523 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4899524 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4899525 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4899526 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown
4899527 fine you stay here if you want but im going back im going back and making this right
4899528 please ron theres just something wrong about what you want to do
4899529 whats wrong is what they did they had no right they never asked me and they had no right all im doing is fixing what they did
4899530 theres no way that im spending the rest of my life with something that belongs to him
4899531 why dont you think about it for say a week if you still want to do it then ill help you
4899532 i dont want to see him a week from know how do you know he wont have changed i couldnt stand to see him like that hermione i have to go today
4899533 i wont let him go one night without it its his its always been his and i want him to have it back
4899534 i know i made a mistake and id like to help make it right
4899535 and just how do you think you can do that
4899536 if you let me in i will try to explain
4899537 please ron i want you to understand that i thought i was doing the right thing i know now that i was wrong and im sorry
4899538 remus is trying to apologize how dare you talk to him like that
4899539 you didnt know and so you should have just left it alone
4899540 all i want to do is to help make it right ill go with you
4899541 have you forgotten that i am the last surviving marauder i could tell by the way you shouted at me and by the look in your eye what you had planned five minutes after i gave you well after i told you what i had done i dont know why i was asked to make the decision but i do know that i made the wrong one and i really do think that i can help
4899542 i think i know a few spells that might make the task a little easier
4899543 you cant actually tell me that you approve of this ron is angry and youre feeling guilty this is not the time for either of you to be making decisions like this
4899544 i think it is the most respectful thing i could do for him now it was disrespectful of me to have taken it in the first place and now it must be returned
4899545 if you are both planning to do this then im coming with you
4899546 and since when has anything ive done with you and harry been easy
4899547 if you have to do this then i have to do this
4899548 i think i felt the same way maybe im just not as passionate as you
4899549 did you think it possible after what we all heard you shout at poor remus that we wouldnt be able to deduce what you would do next i may not be albus dumbledore but i am not totally oblivious
4899550 unless i am much mistaken your parents your sister your brothers nymphadora mr longbottom mr thomas and mr finnigan are already there if you hadnt left the luncheon so quickly we might all have had a chance to tell you that we were prepared to help in any way we could
4899551 surely you didnt think that your friends would let you do something like this alone
4899552 and none of us think you should be alone while you do so
4899553 we all love him and we all love you and we want to make things right
4899554 with my parents ron no matter what else happens you make sure they know that yeah
4899555 but if something should happen to me you make sure they bury me with my parents you promise me
4899556 but i could use some help hermione could you help me and i think itd be best if professor mcgonagall and remus helped too
4899557 is it wingardium leviosa or win gar dium levi o sa
4899558 i just want to make sure i dont mess up say it with me all right
4899559 its all right ron ill help you well help each other
4899560 its the way it should be the way it has to be
4899561 can you make sure they know that i want to be buried here next to harry
4899562 i love you too dad and you too mum please dont be angry
4899563 dont you see im going to keep doing what i was always meant to do im going to look after harry always

4899577 theres that look in his eyes that makes me feel the cold
4899578 i guess if anybody would know whats not in the fundamental interests of newfoundland and labrador its stephen harper because he reneged on his promise regarding offshore oil revenues and worked against our interest by breaking a 10 billion promise and people wont forget that
4899579 i also personally dont forget the comment he made to me in a private meeting where he said we the federal conservative party dont need newfoundland and labrador to win this country
4899580 executive privilege in elections scam conservatives ignore subpoenas to appear before parliamentary ethics committee
4899581 is it because he came up with the idea a bit too late for our federal elections to coincide with the us presidential ones you know for when we are officially the 51st state
4899582 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
4899583 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
4899584 you can learn here but you have to work in another country
4899585 on behalf of the government and people of india and on my own behalf please accept my felicitations and congratulations on your election as prime minister of the federal democratic republic of nepal
4899586 i look forward to working with you to further develop the bonds of good neighborliness that unite our peoples and nations and to deepen the friendly relations that so happily exist between our two countries we in south asia share linked destinies and are engaged in a common struggle against poverty disease and hunger india will continue to stand by the people and government of nepal in consolidating your peaceful democratic transition and in your developmental efforts
4899587 i also look forward to meeting with you in the near future and would be happy to receive you in india as our guest at your earliest convenience
4899588 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4899589 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4899590 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4899591 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4899592 thanks god this morning at 6 21 a m the first grandchild of the president was born this surely adds happiness to president and the family as the grandchild was born exactly on august 17
4899593 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4899594 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4899595 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4899596 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4899597 thats while i am having all these surgeries this year
4899598 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4899599 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4899600 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4899601 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4899602 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4899603 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4899604 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4899605 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4899606 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4899607 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4899608 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4899609 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4899610 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4899611 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now

4899615 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4899616 he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
4899617 because he annoys me dammit thats why you should impeach him

4899622 most places in alaska dont have a persistent problem with bear or moose because if its anywhere near the village they shoot it no questions asked
4899623 its the last frontier mentality you dont tolerate any risk from wild animals
4899624 the joke used to be anchorage isnt too bad because its only two hours from alaska
4899625 the truth is alaska is right here weve got bears we got moose we got wolves you name it
4899626 if you dont get enough to eat you get cranky
4899627 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
4899628 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
4899629 does not apply to civilians working for federal departments or agencies other than dod the department of defense
4899630 if the contractors were not there those state department folks would be guarded by the military prosecutors could argue to the judge that those facts fit within the definition of furthering the defense department mission in iraq
4899631 we need more officers and we are pulling every lever we can
4899632 a lot of my retirement plan hinges on the deployment cycle and the war on terror as it exists today
4899633 our loss rates are fairly stable and the growth is whats killing us
4899634 there is a tipping point that we have started to reach
4899635 there is a much larger percentage of officers planning to get out right at 20 years and once they are gone they are gone
4899636 we are overworked because of the shortages and have nothing to look forward to but another rotation to afghanistan or iraq so everything weighs towards getting out
4899637 as i look to the future i see the choices i am offered narrowing and the freedom of decision i had start to go away because of the shortages
4899638 i was originally scheduled to get my masters and go teach and that was derailed by deployments that window is gone for me now
4899639 the exodus is expected to continue as more officers are leaving sooner because of the strain multiple deployments are having on families
4899640 the army would prefer to promote officers at a lower rate to encourage high performance
4899641 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol
4899642 this strong association suggests that strategies aimed at reducing smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy should target both behaviours
4899643 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
4899644 i wanted to make the perfect coney island experience something that captivates thats an immediate visceral reaction and that lingers in the memory
4899645 theres no better place than an amusement park to confront horror and things were fearful of
4899646 the fact that it took place near roller coasters and cotton candy sends an important message we here can engage in frivolity and fun at a time when in our name this is happening to people somewhere else
4899647 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
4899648 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture
4899649 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
4899650 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4899651 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4899652 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4899653 it looks like a costume a waterlogged costume thats been stuffed into a freezer
4899654 it just doesnt have the hallmark of a real corpse
4899655 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited

4899674 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4899675 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4899676 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of
4899677 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4899678 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4899679 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4899680 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4899681 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4899682 the market unfortunately forces you to be very aggressive if you want to be competitive but at the end of the day i feel great about the player hosmer
4899683 at some point something has to happen to correct the system
4899684 but its the same thing as any sport the market will dictate those numbers i think baseball will take a hard look at it at some point and try to refine it so its a little more balanced for all of us but for now this is how it is and well play by the rules we have
4899685 that was the kind of game you havent seen from us in a while we didnt do any of the little things a lot of wasted opportunities both sides too they were the same
4899686 if you get a hit great everybody loves it if not well we go back out and play defense in the 14th
4899687 david didnt position himself shallow enough in left field to make a play at home plate
4899688 it was on the ground the whole way through the infield i had to keep coming and keep coming so then i had to rush it
4899689 i put it in the zone and he put the bat on it
4899690 we didnt do the things offensively executionwise or approachwise that we needed to do
4899691 we wasted some great stuff by zack greinke he pitched great and it shouldnt have been 2 0 it should have been a minimum of 4 0 if we were just patient
4899692 saying that the junkies shouldnt be near our children is stupid because the junkies are our children

4899702 the recent decisions by the u s supreme court have afforded trial judges greater discretion in sentencing matters however we believe that a case like russell highlights the importance of tough federal sentences a defendant like mr russell who is undeterred by three prior prison terms who repeatedly sells large quantities of crack and who recklessly endangers both police officers and bystanders in a violent escape attempt richly deserves the 15 year sentence that the court imposed
4899703 it should be left to congress not the courts to modify or even abrogate in its entirety the sentencing distinctions between crack cocaine and powder cocaine
4899704 this all occurred at a mcdonalds restaurant a busy place there could have been children running around

4899706 this case by case individualized analysis is precisely the approach endorsed by the supreme court in kimbrough
4899707 thus at its core pho is actually consistent with kimbrough both decisions emphasize the importance of individualized case by case sentencing determinations rather than a reliance on generalized ratios

4899710 these games have brought a lot of attention to beijing
4899711 especially the opening ceremony which was the best one i have seen
4899712 before china was always known for gymnastics and table tennis
4899713 but now running and swimming how can i even say the feeling
4899714 we can create a new history by winning gold medals in all fields not just the traditional ones
4899715 were really proud of our country now because of the way they have held the games and that the athletes are doing really well
4899716 i think china has been doing very hard things to make the olympics successful
4899717 its worth it the whole world looks at china in a new way its not about the old culture anymore
4899718 the chinese communist party says not to mix politics and the games but the way the party is politicizing the games surpasses the politicization of the berlin games in 1936
4899719 having the games in a nation like china that does not cherish human rights and freedom is not a blessing to the rest of the world

4899748 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4899749 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run i tried to do the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4899750 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4899751 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4899752 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4899753 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4899754 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4899755 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4899756 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4899757 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4899758 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4899759 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4899760 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4899761 i led the abramoff investigation i saved the american people excuse me not only american people but native americans millions hundreds of millions millions and millions of dollars

4899774 there is no credible evidence that airborne products will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4899775 its important to note that this is a settlement over older advertising and labeling and has nothing to do with public safety
4899776 weve offered a money back guarantee for our products since 1997 and we have millions of satisfied customers a class action lawsuit sparked this matter were just one of many major consumer brands across america that are under assault by class action lawyers
4899777 the fact they got away with it for years is not a reason they should not be held responsible for it
4899778 even if airborne isnt doing anything for you believing it helps
4899779 i cant tell you the last time i had a cold
4899780 it is pretty much impossible to prove that it didnt prevent a cold if you dont get a cold
4899781 after this week all that phelps has done you dont want to be the guy who stood in his way do something stupid
4899782 i want him to have every shot at doing it
4899783 we work with power where we can build new power where we cant
4899784 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4899785 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees

4899788 with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4899789 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
4899790 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
4899791 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4899792 chairman prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4899793 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4899794 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
4899795 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the line
4899796 we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way
4899797 those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back
4899798 we helped the penguins get their arena we helped the league im not bothered by what lemieux said
4899799 a lot of things happened throughout the negotiations ups and downs that was just a way for us to put more pressure and we knew it would work at the end of the day
4899800 every indication pointed to that they were serious about moving
4899801 i know that scared the hell out of the governor the mayor and it got them in gear
4899802 brian has a considerable history with mike mccarthy the teaching by brian would be very much like the teaching with mike mccarthy
4899803 we havent set the levels yet on our pricing but we are going to be re evaluating the cost of our tickets
4899804 i didnt even know i got the world record until i finished my victory lap
4899805 my aim was to come here and be olympic champion
4899806 i had a pretty good start and i felt i was with usain
4899807 but i saw him pulling away hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone would have beaten him
4899808 i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it my hamstring feels good its not bothering me i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics it just was one of those things that happened
4899809 when you race in the olympics and the trials you peak your body two times
4899810 i was prepared to peak my body twice but the injury set me back three or four weeks i think my mechanics werent where i wanted them to be i think i just ran out of time
4899811 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit
4899812 ive been telling tyson all season when i saw him im really looking forward to competing with him
4899813 if you want to be the best youve got to beat the best
4899814 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4899815 i feel like i did at trials in the first couple of rounds
4899816 my coach said you look really good how did it feel i said coach i feel great i dont want to give everything yet
4899817 i dont think i executed my start the way ive been doing in warm ups and the way my coach wanted me to
4899818 but i dont feel like i overexerted myself and im really excited
4899819 make sure youre in the top two so you can stay in the middle of the track unfortunately ive run myself to the outside of the track before and its not pretty to be out there running for your life by yourself and know the race is going on outside of you
4899820 anybody else it would be like you dont talk to them
4899821 munas just really easy breezy cool and i just get into a nervous nellie mode so its good that we dont become those fierce angry type competitors we can talk
4899822 we took the bus over to the track today we walked in together we chitchatted its kind of a comfortable feeling to know that even though were competitors you still get along well as soon as you cross the finish line its behind you
4899823 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4899824 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4899825 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4899826 i mean it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4899827 if you are on the winning side you are happy doesnt matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it i have been on both sides of it it goes down in the history books however it goes in there you know everybody would like to just go out there and just outrun the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
4899828 i mean i know that nobody always makes the right calls and i know that everyone has to take responsibility for their actions everybody has to take responsibility for their job
4899829 today im hurting im really hurting im drowsy my eyes are flickering
4899830 i drank coffee red bull orange juice water liquids keep me going
4899831 it kind of fires me up i feel like a shark
4899832 i want to wear it all the time but i dont want to look like an idiot
4899833 i dont want to go out there and make any mistakes i dont want to look like an idiot my biggest goal is to just be smooth and gain as much respect as i can
4899834 its not really that big a difference i mean the nationwide series is big time motor sports theres 31 races a year but you can tell the difference when youre in the cup series
4899835 i really didnt realize how nerve racking qualifying would be until i came down to do it
4899836 when i got in the car and started to go around i could feel the nerves after i made the lap and they told me i was in i was just really excited
4899837 my no 1 goal was to make the race and my no 2 goal is to get as many laps as i can without any incident
4899838 my stepdad he raised me to root for your hometown team win lose or draw
4899839 they lost a lot but they were still the hometown team
4899840 as a kid they could lose 100 games and you wouldnt mind it
4899841 i bet i signed my name 1 000 times today i cant believe the people that are this interested in the old as this really proves that people did care a lot about us
4899842 it was like oh no you cant take my team and then all of a sudden they were gone
4899843 i care about the number at the end of the season the last game
4899844 its nice that the university of kansas is recognized in the top 25
4899845 but the poll were focused on is the one at the end of the season thats the one that tells the story
4899846 i told our football team weve got to get better it was sloppy in a lot of ways
4899847 certainly there are some good things some people did out there no question overall weve got a lot of work to do if we want to get ready for this first football game
4899848 until we get to game week everybody is still competing
4899849 how that comes out i dont know obviously he needs all the practices he can get
4899850 chase patton is playing as good as ive ever seen him play
4899851 he made one bad read out of 35 snaps today im not perfect hes not perfect but hes playing at a much higher level than he used to play at
4899852 that last one he was probably trying to bait me a little bit
4899853 to come out here and work hard and get better
4899854 nobodys rooting against anyone thats just not being a good teammate
4899855 i can understand having some type of those errors with the twos threes and fours but its intolerable with the no 1 offense
4899856 that was the kind of game you havent seen from us in a while we didnt do any of the little things a lot of wasted opportunities both sides too they were the same
4899857 if you get a hit great everybody loves it if not well we go back out and play defense in the 14th
4899858 david didnt position himself shallow enough in left field to make a play at home plate
4899859 it was on the ground the whole way through the infield i had to keep coming and keep coming so then i had to rush it
4899860 i put it in the zone and he put the bat on it
4899861 we didnt do the things offensively executionwise or approachwise that we needed to do
4899862 we wasted some great stuff by zack greinke he pitched great and it shouldnt have been 2 0 it should have been a minimum of 4 0 if we were just patient
4899863 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4899864 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4899865 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out we want to keep building on the momentum
4899866 i dont want to just be in the top 35 i want to keep looking forward
4899867 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4899868 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4899869 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4899870 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4899871 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4899872 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4899873 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4899874 the relay and putting four guys together really made it possible
4899875 the biggest thing that ive been thankful for is that i have been able to use my imagination
4899876 when some people said its not possible and it cant be done i think thats when my imagination came into play and i thought i had a chance to do it bob bowman and i talked about it and we were able to get here through a lot of hard work its been fun
4899877 and this is something that will always be a part of me
4899878 finding my voice my story in london photos of celebs at apple lounge grand opening in west hollywood photo of simon rex at the apple lounge grand opening in west hollywood photo of actor craig robinson darryl of the office tv fame and pineapple express movie at the apple lounge grand opening in west hollywood photos
4899879 the games on the line and were out there going for it
4899880 lets win another nine and no one will remember this one
4899881 i hadnt been on the hill to start in a while i felt i had command of my pitches
4899882 he threw me a little cutter that ran in i just told myself get jammed and try to hit it to the right side and luckily for us i did
4899883 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future but these regions are a part of georgia
4899884 i think its very much worthwhile to have given russia that chance
4899885 now i think the behavior recently suggests that perhaps russia has not taken that route or that they would like to have it both ways that is that you behave in a 1968 way toward your neighbors by invading them and at the same time you continue to integrate into the political and diplomatic and economic and security structures of the international community and i think the fact is you cant have it both ways
4899886 liguei o modem no notebook para conseguir navegar n o tive grandes preju zos sem a banda larga mas queria escrever no meu blog
4899887 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data
4899888 could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 8 august at first in south ossetia and then in other regions of georgia
4899889 hamas is trying through this so called legal proceeding to legitimize its human rights violations and assaults on the freedom of expression
4899890 they are using false claims to justify laying their hands on the property of the residents
4899891 our goal is to empty the hamas and fatah jails of all the detainees
4899892 you talk to guys who have been in the game for a long time
4899893 and theyll tell you to throw away the first summer good or bad you dont always get the greatest feel
4899894 but hes 6 feet 5 and probably about 185 pounds hes going to get bigger and stronger but he already has the arm speed and velocity that you look for
4899895 i hope its only a little step ive never had this before im learning as i go with this
4899896 that was when i had to dive back into first other than that it was ok
4899897 the market unfortunately forces you to be very aggressive if you want to be competitive but at the end of the day i feel great about the player hosmer
4899898 at some point something has to happen to correct the system
4899899 but its the same thing as any sport the market will dictate those numbers i think baseball will take a hard look at it at some point and try to refine it so its a little more balanced for all of us but for now this is how it is and well play by the rules we have
4899900 but it just felt more personal to me to represent my family my hometown and kansas state
4899901 he ran down main street with his olympic uniform on
4899902 that was the biggest thing that had ever happened to me
4899903 but the right leg is the outside leg on the turn in the 200
4899904 we got hand me down equipment used shoes but we felt like part of the team
4899905 kansas state gave me a chance and did so much for me ill never be able to fully repay it
4899906 ill win that decathlon and whats more ill break the record
4899907 yes there are a lot of people in prison but wouldnt they be there anyway might as well enjoy the fireworks
4899908 all these kids from the neighborhood come together and start through things like the track club we have a lot of people who go on to great things through sports
4899909 the founding pastor saw a vision for our youth our future so we use things like sports to support them
4899910 everybody not just members is welcome we get a lot of involvement from people who are not church members because theres a need
4899911 we were able to give her more of what she needed until she went to college
4899912 the church has been a foundation for my life from religion to sports
4899913 its where i grew up and honed a lot of my skills as a person ive been at palestine 24 7 since i was a little kid
4899914 i started on the track team when i was 5 years old at palestine as just a thing to do
4899915 i wanted to quit a lot of the time but they wouldnt let me it taught me perseverance and through all that i learned discipline
4899916 and for many no matter the sport the track team was the start
4899917 i think a lot of it was the confidence energy and excitement that ruffin brings
4899918 i definitely thought he could play there right away but i thought hed play on special teams and contribute that way
4899919 they have shown that theyre going to be able to play at this level they have the skill set thats necessary both have been able to show they can run with power which is important
4899920 its all surprising because at first they were recruiting me for safety
4899921 then that switched over to athlete because they werent sure of either offense or defense but when i got here they told me id be a running back
4899922 hes a very confident player he has tremendous vision to do some positive things
4899923 how he was hitting some of the players it was taking two or three people to bring him down
4899924 its a lot of work its not easy as long as you come out here get in your playbook and do what youre supposed to do
4899925 they werent sure where he was going to play but hes stepping in and doing this right away
4899926 people see me out here working a topwater lure in the middle of the day in summer and they think im crazy
4899927 they think the smallmouth bass have to be deep when its hot and sunny
4899928 but thats not always the case i know its contrary to what you would think but you can catch these smallmouths in a couple feet of water all day long at this time of the year
4899929 i think the smallmouths will stay shallow here because of all the rock along the banks and the good vegetation
4899930 even on a day when the temperature is up in the 90s you can bring a topwater lure over that good cover and youll bring the smallmouths up
4899931 i can go about an hour to my west and be at wilson and an hour to my east and be at milford
4899932 you can see these fish busting shad in the back of a cove in the middle of the day
4899933 thats whats fun using topwater even when its hot and sunny
4899934 thats why im out here on a day like this it got to almost 100 degrees today but we still caught fish
4899935 i think the guys played ok but i think we need to improve on a number of points and grow if we are to advance in this tournament the way that we can
4899936 but thats why you have the preseason we did some good things we can build off of
4899937 but thats why you have the preseason we did some good things we can build off of

4899948 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
