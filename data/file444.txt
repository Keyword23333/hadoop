4440018 with the worlds gaming eyes on the games convention at leipzig it was a natural and perfect venue for us to announce our cooperation with nokia in germany

4440020 the cooperation with zeemote shows that nokia is serious about casual gaming we invest in hardware and software to bring consumers a whole new mobile gaming experience
4440021 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4440022 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4440023 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4440024 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4440025 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4440026 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4440027 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4440028 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream
4440029 but that also means that you can lock in a price that wont increase when the economy improves that savings can be substantial and it can give you a huge advantage over your competition

4440063 our competition threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the gm45 did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4440064 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4440065 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4440066 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4440067 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4440068 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further

4440075 after some more posing for photographers and the talkies the whole performance consumed fully an hour the kingfish left the bar with a broad grin leading a crowd of reporters to his apartment on the 22nd floor of the hotel where he spent two hours discoursing on the political situation
4440076 while the writer does not feel equal to enter into a controversy with the versatile and able senator on any subject much less on that of ramos fizzes
4440077 and while not denying that the formula announced by senator long may be that of a perfect fizz still the writer feels obliged to submit to the readers of the times the only authentic and original formula for that famous and delectable decoction

4440090 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4440091 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4440092 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4440093 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4440094 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4440095 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4440096 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4440097 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4440098 its quite possible h9n2 is infecting humans quite a lot much more than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar

4440109 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4440110 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4440111 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u
4440112 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4440113 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4440114 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4440115 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional ceasefire
4440116 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
4440117 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4440118 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4440119 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4440120 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4440121 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4440122 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4440123 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4440124 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4440125 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4440126 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4440127 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4440128 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4440129 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4440130 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4440131 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4440132 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4440133 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4440134 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4440135 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4440136 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4440137 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4440138 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
4440139 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
4440140 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty
4440141 never betray in any way the multimillion russian population in ukraine and renounce our unity with it
4440142 foreign policy considering our current situation and possibilities is being conducted sensibly and ever more forward thinking
4440143 but owing to the heavy burden left by his predecessors an awful awful lot in russia has yet to be lifted up from decline the overall state of peoples lives remains hard and chaotic
4440144 did not know if it was georgian russian or ossetian troops who opened fire
4440145 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4440146 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4440147 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4440148 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4440149 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4440150 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4440151 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4440152 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4440153 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4440154 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4440155 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4440156 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4440157 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4440158 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4440159 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4440160 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4440161 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4440162 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4440163 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4440164 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles

4440490 devolving power downwards from westminster doesnt mean that the blame can always be devolved downwards are you prepared for the inevitable slew of critical media that is an inevitable result of letting go the reins can you resist the temptation to intervene can you take the pressure of labour and liberal democrat authorities demanding central government action to pay for their local mistakes

4440492 will a future conservative government have a go at one and for all sorting out the powers responsibilities and funding of local authorities in such a way that councils once again raise the bulk of the money they spend themselves and hence councillors can be held more fully accountable for the way it is spent

4440500 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4440501 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4440502 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4440503 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4440504 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4440505 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4440506 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4440507 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream
4440508 but that also means that you can lock in a price that wont increase when the economy improves that savings can be substantial and it can give you a huge advantage over your competition
4440509 my brother is getting ready to take his entire family to orlando for a vacation

4440582 everyone has a favorite number and usually theres a personal story behind it
4440583 my tp ball allows golfers to connect with their number and make their golf ball an extension of themselves for example justin rose plays 99 because his wifes lucky number is 9 and hes hoping for twice the luck were inviting golfers to put their number on their ball and to share their story with us starting this fall on mytpball com
4440584 the number 1 because i play the number 1 brand of equipment in golf
4440585 its my lowest score ever and i shot it twice at the 1992 monte carlo open and the 1999 smurfit european open
4440586 my wifes lucky number is 9 so i figure that putting 99 on my ball will give me double the luck
4440587 good things seem to happen when i tee up a number 2 from now on 2s are all im playing
4440588 when i got off the hooters tour i had no money in my pocket i had to borrow money from a relative to enter a local tournament from there i won enough to continue my professional career
4440589 i wore number 11 on my jersey in every sport i played growing up basketball baseball and soccer
4440590 i wanted something different and theres something i like about seeing 00 on my ball
4440591 i chose 69 because if i shoot four of them this week i think ill win the tournament
4440592 take off and nuke it from orbit its the only way to be sure

4440597 ik vind het chic dat hij zelf het besluit heeft genomen ik hoop dat hij schoon schip kan maken en zijn geloofwaardigheid terugwint
4440598 de fractie van groenlinks de partij en ik zullen wijnand enorm missen
4440599 dan moet er wel publieke ruimte zijn om te erkennen dat mensen veranderen en zich ontwikkelen die ruimte heb ik de afgelopen weken weleens gemist
4440600 als ik in zijn positie had gezeten had ik hetzelfde gedaan
4440601 na dat eerste onhandige persbericht over zijn boek heeft wijnand zich hersteld hij verdient groot respect
4440602 in order to be a christian you cant vote for anybody who is pro choice
4440603 i think we know that abortions rise when unwanted pregnancies rise so if we are continuing what has been a promising trend in the reduction of teen pregnancies through education and abstinence education giving good information to teenagers that is important emphasizing the sacredness of sexual behavior to our children i think thats something that we can encourage i think encouraging adoptions in a significant way i think the proper role of government so there are ways that we can make a difference and those are going to be things i focus on when i am president
4440604 with the science and technology facilities council funding situation at the moment i think there is a chance they wont come up with the money thats the concern
4440605 exomars remains a high strategic priority for the uk no decisions about levels of support for instruments have yet been made
4440606 indeed these cannot be made until the scale of the mission and the exact complement of instruments is decided by esa and this will depend fundamentally on the decisions that the esa council ministerial make on the scope and funding envelope of the project
4440607 theres been talk of having races between the three of them but we havent done it yet
4440608 you can keep six of the wheels anchored and then push each one forward one at a time which increases your friction on the ground

4440613 if to talk to oneself when alone is folly it must be doubly unwise to listen to oneself in the presence of others
4440614 it will be available before the end of the year
4440615 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4440616 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4440617 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4440618 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4440619 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4440620 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4440621 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4440622 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4440623 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4440624 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4440625 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4440626 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4440627 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4440628 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4440629 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4440630 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4440631 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4440632 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4440633 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4440634 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4440635 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4440636 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4440637 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4440638 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4440639 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4440640 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4440641 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4440642 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4440643 we have a great chance to defend our title and we fully expect to capitalise on our home advantage to win a second time
4440644 sometimes we lose our concentration and if that happens in the last two matches we could lose our title
4440645 ive read about you in business magazines over the years what is the nickname they gave you

4440798 we need to change our mentality quickly for the premier league opener
4440799 we have a few minor injuries bruises and so on xabi alonso and yossi benayoun have got some small problems but they will be okay for the game in sunderland
4440800 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4440801 competition for places must improve we have several away or injured we need more players to out pressure on players
4440802 i do not like to talk about specific players but clearly we were not the best we were not good in midfield or the defence
4440803 if you have more players competing for positions in the team things are better we need new players but for the moment we must work to make the ones we have got better players
4440804 now we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game at
4440805 we know in liege it was not our best game but we want to step things up and we know there is quality in the team we have shown that in pre season and now we must show it in competitive matches too
4440806 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at
4440807 will it interfere with my anime or video game time after school
4440808 updating your computer is almost complete your computer needs to be restarted for the updates to take effect do you want to restart now
4440809 the game on saturday morning comes very quickly but in fairness i am not in a position where i can make many changes at the moment
4440810 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game but diaby will take four to six weeks
4440811 they have got the control and they have got the quality and if they play for arsenal then that means they are very good
4440812 i am happy for them because when i was the same age as them i dont think i was at a big club like
4440813 you could say a game here is worth two elsewhere but it is more than that
4440814 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game
4440815 that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me
4440816 at this club all you have to do is look across at ryan giggs and paul scholes and see the way they train
4440817 it is such an example they set despite the success they have had and the rewards they have received they still want more and more
4440818 from now on the dutch participants in the olympic games can make use of a censor free internet a dutch company has taken measures to bypass the restrictions put in place by the chinese authorities
4440819 i still remember being out on that practice field and looking south and thinking of my hometown hope
4440820 i remember walking off that field and telling former razorbacks quarterback scott bull that id do just about anything for a slice of one them hope watermelons
4440821 coach broyles gave it his ok right on the phone and connected me with harold horton and we set it up with danny ford
4440822 harold horton introduced me to coach bobby petrino at a razorback club meeting this spring and i told him about the melons and he said bring them on
4440823 whats important is that these kids know we support them
4440824 i had the pleasure of meeting him when i first arrived
4440825 and i was scheduled to visit him in little rock for lunch on friday
4440826 was a good businessman a good politician and a big razorback fan
4440827 its not just a loss to the community of jacksonville and pulaski county
4440828 we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4440829 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4440830 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4440831 we are working calming in the background on one or two things we prefer to work with as much discretion as we can
4440832 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4440833 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent
4440834 they let me know this morning in the team meeting
4440835 im excited about having the opportunity to go to ones and im just busting my butt
4440836 all the freshmen knew we were going to have a fair opportunity
4440837 tackling drill where you just hop up and you go out there and make a play
4440838 later that day they asked me if i thought i could get up to 225 in 30 days
4440839 i was excited about finally having the opportunity to go with the ones and im trying to bust my butt
4440840 thats one of the reasons why i came here because i knew they needed help at the safety position
4440841 im just not really worried about playing time right now
4440842 ive just got to learn this playbook because its another position so im starting all over
4440843 if you go down and someone else steps up and has a big day then you lost your job
4440844 so i always tell them every day in the meeting room its survival of the fittest and if youre not tough enough to be out there then youre not going to play
4440845 to see the joy that you bring to the kids when they see us with the watermelons it makes you feel so good
4440846 the bible teaches that its better to give than to receive and this is my way of giving back i love it
4440847 i think the last couple of days nathan dick would agree that he took a couple of steps back
4440848 but the sun will come up tomorrow and hell keep going forward
4440849 i think the last couple of days his concentration and his focus is not where it needs to be
4440850 the blocking schemes dont change with the quarterback in fact i dont really know who is back there
4440851 i definitely think we will be much more productive on offense this season actually burns presence served as a wake up call for senior brandon cox last season
4440852 youd like to establish some go to guys studs you have to feed the ball to
4440853 thats always been our philosophy his younger brother paul doesnt need everyone to step up right now but he needs a handful to emerge
4440854 we definitely want to have four guys who can go out there and make plays and maybe a fifth that can help keep people fresh
4440855 im not going to rotate guys just to rotate them
4440856 im not just going to sit back and say ive got a position because i dont feel no one has a position
4440857 when you get a special player and a unique player you like to play them right away and hope you get all four years out of them
4440858 its been really competitive learning all the plays and as a freshman just getting the feel of it
4440859 when you get out there you have to make plays
4440860 i plan to make a decision a week after my last visit
4440861 ive watched them on tv a lot and i like how they run their program
4440862 i really like to go after the ball carrier plus i can drop back into pass coverage 1 on 1 well
4440863 hes upfront and he told us what they had to offer and what they plan to do
4440864 hes no longer a sleeper a lot of people know about him
4440865 he got a lot of attention during the may recruiting period he can run tthats the key to his game his ability to run so well
4440866 i loved everything about arkansas i got a chance to go to anatomy class and actually loved the feel of the classroom too i was amazed by everything and i think it was the only choice to me that made sense
4440867 when i did get the boston college offer i was excited
4440868 i dont think theres even a word to describe it with the opportunities it opens up
4440869 i plan to go premed and then find a specialty that im interested in
4440870 he did some instinctive things moving and throwing the football out of the shotgun that we like
4440871 i think reps are how you learn and get things clear in your mind
4440872 im recognizing things more but playing against the second team everything is faster
4440873 the defense is faster so your decisions have to come that much quicker
4440874 out of the gun sets and the three wide receivers sets and even the empty sets there are some similarities to what we did at greenwood
4440875 but theres lot of differences in the running game and under center and with the cadences
4440876 tyler looks good if hes doing the things he likes to do or is comfortable doing moving around throwing out of the shotgun
4440877 but he doesnt take the proper drop sometimes his under thecenter run game footwork is not good hes not comfortable with it
4440878 those are the things we are going to have to get cleaned up and cleaned up fast
4440879 our terminology is different our techniques is different and our communication at the line of scrimmage is different
4440880 we have two and half weeks before the first game i just have to keep on learning
4440881 hes starting to understand how important every detail of playing the position is
4440882 when you are asked to run the show to make all the checks and make all the decisions you really have to be technique sound and focus snap after snap after snap
4440883 its been a process but weve got a little over two weeks left
4440884 we have to accelerate it and get it to where it needs to be
4440885 hes just got to pick up his concentration and focus this is a serious job on this level when you play quarterback youre on the field and are pretty much in control of everything thats going on
4440886 we are going to ask him to make the decisions
4440887 i havent had the chance to talk about that with my polish counterpart yet but i hope to go very soon to sign it

4440891 we knew we had to clean up the pick and roll defense
4440892 they ran pick and rolls against us something like 40 times we knew that in order for us to win we had to control their pick and roll
4440893 communication is the no 1 thing when it comes to defense thats what we did we helped each other through it and then we dared them to make shots from the outside
4440894 i last saw leon at the glamour awards i was collecting an award so it was cool to have him there with me

4440899 even as barack obama proposes fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen our economy and restore the balance that has been lost in recent years we hear the familiar protests and distortions from the guardians of the broken status quo many of these very same critics made many of these same overheated predictions in previous elections they said president clintons 1993 deficit reduction plan would wreck the economy now they are making the same claims about sen obamas tax plan which has even lower taxes than prevailed in the 1990s including lower taxes on middle class families lower taxes for capital gains and lower taxes for dividends
4440900 clinton promised not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his social programs in fact he repeatedly promised a middle class tax cut
4440901 on many issues he insists on having it both ways
4440902 on august 10 1993 pres clinton signed into law the largest tax increase in u s history the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 is constructed to collect 241 000 000 000 in new taxes on personal income corporations and gasoline over the next five years
4440903 the income tax boost accounts for more than half the revenue raised by the 1993 clinton package two smaller elements accounting for about a fifth of the revenue pinch the middle class the gas tax and a tax boost for social security recipients earning more than 34 000
4440904 our year to date sales growth of 99 for the ps3 reaffirms that consumers are indeed embracing ps3 as their entertainment hub of choice with its feature rich offerings like blu ray and our recently announced video delivery service

4440907 youre an adult why dont you go tell some one cant you go to city council theyll listen to you
4440908 come home in one piece mate arsenal need you more than mexico
4440909 we have to realise that while its good to play nice football there are times when you need to be dirty to win a game we have learned a lot recently one of the lessons is that sometimes you have to be tough when you are on the pitch that is part of football we dont have to be beautiful all the time
4440910 on wednesday night we didnt play good football certainly nowhere near our best but we won 2 0 and thats what it is all about
4440911 the nature of cherished plate sales and transfers means that guidance and assistance are often needed with the red tape and official requirements
4440912 the auction is a great way to sell the competitive nature of bidding means that the price is often pushed up a little and more money returned to the seller than might have been achieved with a more conventional sale

4440914 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4440915 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4440916 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4440917 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4440918 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4440919 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4440920 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4440921 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4440922 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4440923 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4440924 that michael phelps can take a three minute shower in 2 1 2 minutes
4440925 i think he made a step up last year at the second part of the season
4440926 especially in some games where he started to show he can make a decision
4440927 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4440928 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
4440929 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4440930 they had given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking from then on we looked more comfortable
4440931 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4440932 ey a man cant go out with someone that easily am i you
4440933 i promised to write something for someone i missed the deadline and cant write it

4440938 i think certainly theyre fitter for a start thats probably the thing id see most of all
4440939 i think theyre in better physical shape than they have been in a while
4440940 i think theres a good few new and younger players coming into the set up
4440941 prescott looks dangerous but hes just the kind of opponent i need at this stage of my career to get my fear instinct to kick in
4440942 he may have been knocking them out left right and centre but im going to make him wake up and smell the coffee
4440943 ive been working on my defensive skills with new coach jorge rubio and it looks like prescott will be testing out what ive been learning in the gym
4440944 along with my strength and conditioning coach im also punching harder than ever before and i think my offensive skills are going to win my this fight
4440945 i love to entertain the crowd and i plan to go to war against prescott
4440946 i wont be hiding from him ill go after him and try and knock him out like i do with all my opponents
4440947 its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4440948 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands
4440949 you cant do it for them you can draw on your own experiences and tell them what it will be like and you can try to recreate situations at training we trust these boys that they will put it all out on the park this saturday
4440950 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4440951 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4440952 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know

4440965 to those of you who have been asking us to do a warm up gig well we certainly gave it a good try
4440966 i even managed to book a couple of potential dates with those fine people at the pitz in milton keynes scene of much lawnmower related stupidity in days of old however no matter how hard we tried we just couldnt get a date where everyone was free at the same time
4440967 sadly then this means there will not be a warm up gig prior to the bullet for my valentine date in november
4440968 bit of a shame really because weve been rehearsing with paddy and we would have liked to have done the warm up gig to get him back on stage with us
4440969 a big thanks to paul at the pitz for his assistance in trying to help us get the warm up arranged top fella
4440970 so back to rehearsals for us weve got kev and pete joining us at the end of the month so this will be the first time weve all been together since the final gig with the spudmonsters all those years ago

4441168 frozen rivers account of two women who end up unlikely partners smuggling illegal immigrants over the canadian border is very much the vision of writer director courtney hunt who told the story first as a short film before expanding it to feature length
4441169 frozen rivers virtues start with its unusual setting the area around the town of massena in upstate new york just across the st lawrence river from canada and also home to a mohawk reservation that straddles the border with
4441170 frozen river is the way it initially emphasizes how unlikely partners like fire and ice these two exceptionally tough women are

4441186 dit is een keuze geweest omdat we ervan uitgingen dat er geen problemen zouden ontstaan voorafgaand aan de test was dit moeilijk in te schatten
4441187 dit stelt ons in staat de resultaten uit de test te evalueren om vervolgens passende maatregelen te nemen op deze manier verwachten wij met een oplossing te komen die al onze hd abonnees en hd content providers tevreden stelt
4441188 blijken er bugs in de software te zitten dus hebben we update teruggedraaid naar de versie van v r 6 augustus dat was niet nodig voor de boxen met de digitale recorder want daarvoor kregen we geen klachten we gaan dit volgende week nog evalueren
4441189 bij de helpdesk was en is iedereen op de hoogte gesteld bij elke volgende update zullen we de klanten wel informeren als er risicos kunnen optreden dat er iets fout gaat
4441190 in de tussentijd vragen wij klanten die een storing ervaren als gevolg van het invoeren van hdcp contact met ons op te nemen wij adviseren hen tegelijkertijd contact op te nemen met de producent van de televisie
4441191 bij opnieuw invoeren van de software kan de tv weer op zwart gaan dat kan aan de tv liggen als die hdcp niet ondersteunt moet de eigenaar bij de producent zijn
4441192 de reden waarom we hdcp invoeren is omdat contractuele afspraken met de hd content providers studios en zenders ons hiertoe dwingen met de invoering van hdcp verzekert upc zich van blijvende doorgifte van hd zenders tot op heden voerde upc geen hdcp

4441194 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4441195 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4441196 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4441197 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4441198 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4441199 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4441200 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4441201 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream
4441202 but that also means that you can lock in a price that wont increase when the economy improves that savings can be substantial and it can give you a huge advantage over your competition

4441240 bij autobestuurders daalde het aantal doden met 7 8 procent en bij bestelwagens met 2 7 procent
4441241 zelfs het aantal doden bij alcohol gerelateerde ongevallen daalde totaal is het aantal doden gedaald tot 1 37 per honderd miljoen afgelegde kilometer dat is een historische laagterecord in 1966 vielen er nog meer dan 5 doden per honderd miljoen afgelegde kilometer toen vielen er 50 000 doden in het amerikaanse verkeer

4441286 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes
4441287 the goods are registered by a camera integrated in the scales an image evaluation algorithm compares the image with stored data and thus automatically recognizes which type of fruit this is
4441288 the new scales are very tolerant to fluctuations in color and brightness the module can be employed under many different kinds of illumination and with different kinds of camera supermarket employees can of course extend the selection of fruit recognized by the scales to make it include new varieties
4441289 the marketing effect of organising the olympics is not necessarily good in that respect the troms olympics is a high risk project

4441293 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
4441294 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
4441295 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
4441296 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions
4441297 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4441298 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4441299 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4441300 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4441301 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4441302 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4441311 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
4441312 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
4441313 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
4441314 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
4441315 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
4441316 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
4441317 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation
4441318 the use of chili peppers as a spice has spread to nearly every culture within 20 degrees of the equator and it tends to decline as you move toward the poles
4441319 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
4441320 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
4441321 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
4441322 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex
4441323 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4441324 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4441325 im so sick of hearing people say turn off 3g
4441326 uh why pay an extra 10 for at amp ts iphone plan and get a new phone that is advertised to just work then i returned my iphone 3g because the iphone 3g stinks in my opinion i went back to my original iphone
4441327 we urge our customers to synch iphone 3g to itunes frequently to ensure they have the latest software updates

4441333 the idea that inbreeding causes health problems in particular dog breeds is not a new one but we believe ours is the first scientific study to explore this issue and analyse the extent of inbreeding in a systematic way across many breeds we hope that following our work dog breeders will make it a high priority to increase the genetic diversity within different breeds otherwise we will see growing numbers of dogs born with serious genetically inherited health problems
4441334 brings a kind of rare combination of youthful enthusiasm that you would expect but he matches that with an extraordinary amount of experience
4441335 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now

4441354 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
4441355 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
4441356 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
4441357 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
4441358 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
4441359 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4441360 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
4441361 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
4441362 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison

4441388 the one question we never got to was do we even support this or do we oppose it
4441389 when they passed it we bypassed that question the question was what amendments do we have
4441390 i wanted to bring that to the commission because its a tough call
4441391 i dont know what the best decision is to go with something thats a very principled stand that has a less likely chance of passing or to go with something thats maybe a little less principled but that we feel good about and we feel we can live with that will almost certainly pass

4441434 because the pleasure centres are firing so freely the enamoured person falls in love not only with the beloved but with the world and romanticizes his view of it things that normally bother us dont we love being in love not only because it makes it easy for us to be happy but also because it makes it harder for us to be unhappy

4441440 we are very excited to partner with nona this year for our third annual moonlight serenade gala their work is making such a difference in the lives of families throughout the okanagan and we want to contribute to their efforts

4441442 everything is premised around waterfront in the okanagan private moorage is a rarity moorage is at a high premium in the area and can be extremely prohibitive having a private place for your boat is a unique privilege that the sheerwater lifestyle affords
4441443 his style of dealing with employees is probably something people in my position arent crazy about
4441444 but if you look at his history he tends to grow companies he is involved with we are hopeful in that regard
4441445 is a real sign of confidence in the brand in our strategic direction
4441446 one thing thats the same is that we are executing against a strategic plan that has been in place for a number of years
4441447 but this is not likely to offset the losses in the first half of the year

4441477 warren kinsellas new book is a must read for anyone interested in political campaigning in canada and not just political campaigning i wish id had the chance to read the war room before i became stephen harpers campaign manager it might have saved me from many mistakes and months of painful learning on the job
4441478 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer

4441485 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4441486 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
4441487 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes
4441488 back in december of last year relatively few people had installed the flash player needed to play h 264 content now almost 80 of bbc iplayer users have it
4441489 when you take cocaine the number of glutamate receptors increases rendering the cell more excitable when we block this process we prevent relapses into addiction this is interesting clinically since that is the phase when we can get hold of patients
4441490 one of the major problems we have in clinical trials for new melanoma therapies is that we cant identify the people who are going to have a slower disease progression no matter what they receive in a clinical trial
4441491 when new treatments are tested it is necessary to show clinical benefit by comparing patients who receive the new therapy with those who do not although patients might all have the same type of cancers there can be big differences in their survival simply because their cancers behave differently and this may have nothing to do with the treatment if we are able to identify the good players and the bad players up front it becomes a whole lot easier figuring out whether good results are due to the new treatment or not most importantly far fewer patients would be needed for the clinical trials its partly because we cant clinically identify subtypes of patients that we have to do very large and very expensive trials and of course this increases the time it takes to test the clinical benefit of potential new therapies
4441492 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4441493 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4441494 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4441495 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4441496 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy
4441497 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4441498 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4441499 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4441500 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4441501 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4441502 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects
4441503 the torch study brings some clarity to the treatment picture and provides some hopeful signs for patients with copd
4441504 this study also demonstrates that no treatment placebo is not an option for patients with moderate to severe copd
4441505 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4441506 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4441507 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4441508 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements
4441509 if we could decrease with more refined measurements the mortality rate due to mechanical ventilation by 4 5 percent this could save up to 7500 lives in the u s if we accept that ali ards has an incidence of 150000 year
4441510 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
4441511 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
4441512 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
4441513 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
4441514 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap

4441538 ich glaube dass er die gesamte spielzeit die rolle einnehmen kann die ihn in der r ckrunde ausgezeichnet hat er wird sein hohes niveau halten denn er hat sich l ngst an die liga gewohnt
4441539 das spiel gibt uns viel selbstvertrauen f r die liga
4441540 ich bin nicht mourinho ich sage nicht ich werde zehn titel gewinnen sondern ich sage ich werde es versuchen
4441541 so sch n die titel der vergangenen saison waren sie z hlen jetzt nichts mehr
4441542 contrary to published reports those impacted were distributed across our organization rather than focused on a single department also contrary to published reports the layoffs were unrelated to any ongoing discussions to divest a portion of our business that claim is irresponsible journalism and outright false
4441543 we never had such an agreement all we said in march was we were cooperating with bittorrent on doing tests on how we deliver peer to peer content on our network and to find out if there was a more efficient way to deliver those bits given that p2p hasnt always been as efficient running over networks as it could be
4441544 with respect to bittorrent the fcc announcement is about our managing our network by delaying a certain number of peer to peer file transfers were moving to a protocol agnostic network management so all protocols will be treated equally our march agreement with bittorrent continues
4441545 it does hurt them and they are still competing with what is largely a traditional distribution market cable satellite or dsl and we still live in a world of good enough if i can get through a set top box get most of what i want why set up a bittorrent hub
4441546 the status quo doesnt lend itself to the bittorrent market and as long as the status quo is good enough for most people its tough for bittorrent to build a market

4441549 our country has inflicted great pain on many nations especially those in
4441550 on behalf of the japanese people i express my condolences and deep regret to all the victims
4441551 for young people under the age of 16 the county council receives 100 per day and for 16 to 18 year olds we receive 45 per day from the home office
4441552 so it depends on the cost of the placement and age of the child to what we request from the locality budget
4441553 we are able to reclaim costs in most cases however in a few complex cases where the child in question has particular needs then the local authority may fund additional services
4441554 stuff i mean those character specific commercials they aired a collection of clips from the show spotlighting a certain character
4441555 we go up there every week to make sure it is all alright
4441556 we still feel like a family it is just that there is an emptiness without her
4441557 you would expect the graves to be safe if they just returned them that would be something i just cant believe someone would do something like this
4441558 i go up to her grave as often as i can
4441559 to me she is my daughter and she always will be a big part of my life
4441560 i have mixed emotions and i just want to make the grave as nice a place as i possibly can for her
4441561 to know someone has been up there and taken the lights feels like a violation it is as if a burglar has gone through our house
4441562 i can protect my children i have with me here but i cant protect angel who ever did this must be warped
4441563 this is a thoughtless and heartless crime which has caused great distress to the families i would urge anyone with any information about these thefts to contact us
4441564 we have had no formal complaints but we are sending a team to investigate initially they will ascertain the level of the sound and whether it is a statutory nuisance before taking further action
4441565 it is like feedback but it is continuous i like to look at the stars at night and i can always hear it
4441566 i think it is more audible at night because there arent any other background noises and i have just learnt to accept it
4441567 the sound runs between 6pm and 5am and it does get loud enough to keep you awake
4441568 it is a continuous drone and you can block it out
4441569 i first heard it about six weeks ago and i just ignored it but now i really want to know where it is coming from
4441570 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by at st louis we have senator obama on board the aircraft and his campaign
4441571 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4441572 this would untie the hands of local authorities and enable them to fulfil their duties under the gender equality duty alongside local authorities across the country we urge the government to enact reform and give local communities a voice
4441573 most of us agree that there are areas in cities where perhaps adult entertainment is suitable but there are areas where it certainly is not

4441576 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4441577 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4441578 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4441579 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4441580 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4441581 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4441582 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4441599 we feel that in the documents presented last night both in moscow and in tbilisi the principal element the respect of the territorial integrity of georgia is missing
4441600 full support for the territorial integrity of georgia within internationally recognised borders
4441601 we seek to fill ourselves cure our aches and pains live forever
4441602 the cross suggests that this good news is the beginning of problems we would gladly have avoided the turning away from the quest for self fulfillment the ultimate mocking of our claims for goodness the principalities and powers tremble only before the cross nothing less than death will do painful full scale conversion letting go turning from ourselves and toward god
4441603 this meal the lords supper is not some magical mystery medicine we take to exempt ourselves from the hard facts of life in the world it is a way of confronting those hard facts no prayers of a tv evangelist no prayer cloth from arizona no holy oil or water no holy food no technique for self betterment no sincere social program exempts us from this death
4441604 but at the table with cup in hand even our most painful times are redeemed because this savior saves through suffering
4441605 no you can say that our god has been there before our god does not flinch in the face of evil in a hurting world where injustice still sends good ones to the cross we do have something to preach we like paul before us boldly lift up the cup and daringly preach christ and him crucified if we would follow this lord we must follow him down this narrow way of passion
4441606 ah senor you have excellent taste those are bulls balls from the bull fight this morning a delicacy
4441607 what the heck im on vacation bring me an order
4441608 i am so sorry senor there is only one serving a day since there is only one bull fight each morning if you come early tomorrow and place your order we will be sure to serve you this delicacy
4441609 these are much much smaller than the ones i saw you serve yesterday

4441618 het is zon bijzondere ervaring het lijkt allemaal nog heel onwerkelijk en ik denk dat ik pas in nederland zal beseffen wat ik hier allemaal meemaak ik ben gewoon in china en heb prins willem alexander maxima en premier balkenende ontmoet
4441619 er zijn overdag veel bijeenkomsten van noc nsf of van holland business promotion het klinkt heel zakelijk maar de meesten verschijnen gewoon in hun vrijetijdskleding wat wel opvalt is dat de chinese zakenmensen erg ingetogen zijn niet enthousiast maar ook niet negatief er valt dus moeilijk van hun gezichten af te lezen of ze het nou echt leuk vinden
4441620 ze zijn allemaal in een oranje shirt gehesen en willen dolgraag de nederlandse en engelse taal leren tussen het werk door leren we elkaar dus ook woorden zoals goedemorgen en dankjewel
4441621 so we know him from old he is talented they dont give out world silver medals too easily so its obvious hes handy
4441622 he didnt perform to his best the last day but got a victory
4441623 maybe this might suit him in the sense that theres not much expectation of him it probably wont be an exciting fight because theyre both counter punchers
4441624 it could be a situation where theres two guys looking at each other for a good bit of it
4441625 they all gave us 100 per cent in their preparation and the support team has been completely committed but it is not just the disappointment of the event here but the years of work that have one into this which does not reflect the ability of the team
4441626 i hope our funding is not affected margaret hicks the new performance director and i came in only a year ago very much with 2012 in mind and uk sport has always been right behind us they know we are looking forward to 2102 and that we need to make more changes what we have to do now is create more depth in our system and this is not something we can do overnight
4441627 im very frustrated more disappointed than anything because i didnt perform to my full potential
4441628 apart from eating and sleeping judo is all i ever do
4441629 i used to look in the mirror and say thats not what i want to be
4441630 no seriously lads a bunch of nettles got caught in my cogs and i slipped and simply couldnt stop myself scything down their centre forward from behind
4441631 and pacos sound we communicate perfectly and hes after picking up the cork slang now
4441632 i was nearly like dyou want to race now boys here out on the track
4441633 i was 28th in sydney a full eight minutes behind him so i looked him up on his website and sent him an email told him how much i admired him
4441634 i thought nothing more about it but he rang me i was at home in cork and thought someone was winding me up
4441635 looking back i was so innocent and raw but he said they were training in johannesburg if i wanted to join them and i was gone
4441636 if id been more experienced and had more belief in osaka last year i would have been fourth
4441637 i got passed by two with a kilometre to go mentally i had a safety net like even if i finished eighth or ninth that was brilliant for me
4441638 i cant even remember what i had for breakfast thats what boxing is doing to my head
4441639 is to be the first one on the field the last one off it so far so good
4441640 especially after last year in chicago world championships when so many of us fell at the last hurdle for qualification there was a lot of people out there talking bad about us
4441641 the whole training camp was supposed to be a disaster the high performance programme was no good there was too much training being done all a load of pony
4441642 this is all about trial and error and i was happy to be part of the old system under the iaba and now the high performance programme were getting everything we need now the training camps the competition and thats the only way forward
4441643 if youre going to score and not get them theres a chance of being overturned here kenny landed shots very cleanly in the second round i think everyone in the stadium saw them except the five guys sitting down around the ring
4441644 or at least three of them didnt see it at the same time anyway but it is worrying because it was 2 1 at that stage landing five clean shots and not getting them can break your heart
4441645 if i throw a good punch and nothing happens you can hear a bit of cursing and thats in your head if youre after landing a punch and its not coming up on the screen
4441646 but when you hear the cheering you know youre doing something right its good to have them there because it gives you a fair idea of what score you are
4441647 were in the gym all the time six days a week training so hard all for those eight minutes in the ring
4441648 its nonsense because its all on the day youve seen it yourself the last week with all the world champions getting beaten here theres actually three of them gone out of the tournament now so the head is the most important thing if thats right youre laughing its a big jigsaw but the biggest piece is upstairs
4441649 we always felt we were capable of doing it but the head part is the key part once kenny was right in that department he was in control from the very beginning
4441650 but the stakes are getting higher again now the brazilian is very strong hell go for four rounds kenny has all the talent on him but hes got to bring it to the table if hes not going to be scoring hes going to struggle and this guy has a tight defence
4441651 the olympics was one of the goals of the season for me so obviously the quarter finals is not going to do it
4441652 i think james played well i can only really say how well he played ive played him on many occasions but this was the best ive seen him im happy for him i hope he can go all the way now
4441653 im not happy with this tournament i wish i could have done much more
4441654 but ive still got to look forward to the us open i still have that and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now and try and save my season
4441655 its like tiger woods when they dont win every single week its called a bad year
4441656 rogers been in two finals of a slam and the semi finals of a slam to consider that a bad year is just amazing
4441657 would be to admit that those who planted the device in omagh that day have been victorious
4441658 the attack may have wrecked the town and killed and maimed many people but we have rebuilt our town we remember our dead in a reverent way and we continue to support our injured and traumatised
4441659 everybody has their way of coping and my way of coping is to get on with it
4441660 i dont need thick arms in canoeing its about technique thank god
4441661 after the games finish we can now hold his wedding
4441662 the book will include explosive information and confessions surrounding the events in seoul and the aftermath
4441663 i also tell how i slept with the sister of an england footballer and a gold medal winning athlete from america
4441664 and read about that one and only disaster date with kelly holmes
4441665 the points didnt go for me today in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for the olympics it is unbelievable even though i know ive had better days i still thought my performance was exceptional and i should have won six or seven points with some good body shots the way it is now you might as well do fencing if they are going to judge like that
4441666 it is not enough to say that some of the scoring here over the last few days has been outrageous
4441667 it is going beyond that its as though they are trying to destroy boxing in the olympics far too many shots arent even registering it has become almost physically painful to watch fighters going for what they believe is the chance of their lifetimes and then seeing the ridiculous results of their efforts flashing up on the tv screen
4441668 winning an olympic medal has been my dream since i was six years old
4441669 in the end it didnt matter but at one point kenny clearly landed six clean hits and not one of them registered
4441670 i was desperate to get some idea of what they were basing the scoring on but after hours of looking at that screen i still had no idea its bewildering and it could have terrible results like the wrong fighters winning medals
4441671 i feel the pressure has gone after all these months of working for a medal and im looking to relaxing at being at home with my family i didnt do my homework and my tactics didnt work
4441672 we had done plenty of homework on a fighter that bradley had already beaten but he was not relaxed tonight the french kid has quality and we could have no complaints
4441673 but we are not complaining about the result were saying that there is a real problem with the scoring its causing confusion sometimes you just dont know whats happening
4441674 but it could be true that doesnt give us an even playing field certain countries go by the rules and certain countries may not
4441675 when youre talking about competition at this level it requires financial support
4441676 one of my competitors walking out said it reminded her of melbourne for the commonwealth games so there you go
4441677 i would suggest that in the long endurance outdoor sports you can see an impact these athletes are talking about seconds apart long term exposure in these conditions it can certainly take seconds off
4441678 i was expecting the worst and we put measures in place if it was necessary but it hasnt been an issue not since ive been here
4441679 its visible you can see it but it doesnt bother me
4441680 we were all going to be in the same situation so it doesnt matter at all
4441681 the council held a meeting yesterday evening with prime minister nouri al maliki and vice president tariq hashimi and adil abdul mahdi
4441682 the executive board agreed after extensive discussion of talks on the iraqi american convention on the support of the negotiating team on iraq
4441683 the executive board discussed the achievements of the process augurs well that began in last july 29 in diyala and the possibility of reaching a solution to all problems and obstacles facing operations has been also agreed to solve these problems through the law and the constitution and the judiciary
4441684 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it
4441685 concentrate put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket
4441686 such a tool must be neutral and not bias advertisers toward buying on google properties or those that have google ads which of course is going to be a perceived bias in any case such is the price of being very big
4441687 google ad planner combines information from a variety of sources such as aggregated google search data opt in anonymous google analytics data opt in external consumer panel data and other third party market research
4441688 its been a long road to get here i cannot believe what has just happened ive won a gold medal
4441689 i was shaking a little bit up there but it is great to be there to hear the national anthem
4441690 it was a small heart procedure to take care of things and get back in training
4441691 i definitely think i exceeded my expectations i already have two medals and i came here for one event things are going great
4441692 as i get through the meet it starts to flow better and everything goes faster
4441693 i have only raced her three or four times in the past each time i remember how she went out faster and it kinda got into my head

4441701 our figures also show nine people were killed two soldiers two milf and the rest civilians
4441702 it will be the peoples decision if they want to go back to their homes we will not push them
4441703 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
4441704 fifty six children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups
4441705 they now feel the dream of dr marin luther king when the day that the sons of slaves and sons of slave owners will sit together on the table of brotherhood has now become real
4441706 they feel now dr kings hope of a time when americans will no longer look at the color of their skin but rather the content of their character
4441707 he talks about hope and believes that there is nothing false about hope
4441708 i am sure he senator obama would restore basic civil rights which many are being denied in the name of war on terror all over the world
4441709 obama articulates his policies in favor of the poor and marginalized
4441710 i sincerely believe that that phenomenon called obama will duly sign the kyoto protocol on the restriction of industrial pollution and checking of cfc and other ozone gobbling dangerous gases of which america is the chief culprit
4441711 africa often tends to behave a bit like an unwanted orphan who suddenly discovers a famous uncle wholl hopefully wipe away the tears and provide a protective arm
4441712 because of his tenuous association with africa we will feel entitled to offer our sage advice and allow ourselves to be disappointed insulted almost at what we view as his faults or failures we should relieve ourselves of such burdens hes not ours he doesnt speak for us he doesnt have to he doesnt owe us anything not a tuppence

4441714 considering that most muslim countries allow women to participate saudi arabia and brun have no excuse to exclude women other than misogyny of course and in the meantime all muslims will once again be labeled as misogynist
4441715 it includes answers to over 55 questions about the platforms western game creators develop for the market sectors they are working in the tools they use and the amount of money they spend on them
4441716 literally in the process of working out a self surrender
4441717 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4441718 it continues to amaze me that corporations like mcdonalds continue to publically and financially support things that alienate their consumer base shareholders as wells as customers should be outraged at the blatant position this company has taken on this issue
4441719 mcdonalds corporation has a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to continue to earn profits and expand their company by alienating such a large consumer base the christian community they are undoubtedly neglecting this responsibility
4441720 we are a pro life pro family mutual fund group we are uniquely different from your typical sri fund in that we will not invest in companies that are involved in the areas of pornography abortion anti family entertainment and the promotion of non married lifestyles
4441721 mcdonalds has gone so far as to accuse those who oppose the gay agenda including same sex marriage of being motivated by hate i wonder if mcdonalds officially recognizes or even has a christian employee group because they certainly recognize mcdonalds gay lesbian and network
4441722 pressures and burdens which have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in the bentleys relationship we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah
4441723 in his late teens todd had a dramatic encounter with the saving and delivering power of god this experience brought todd out of a lifestyle of drug and alcohol addiction without cravings or withdrawal symptoms he was also delivered from a lifestyle involving criminal activity youth prisons drugs sex satanic music and bondage
4441724 i had to be obedient to the lord sir why did the preacher just knee you in the gut i tell you the lord is working in you you felt a quivering
4441725 as unbelievable as it may sound i actually saw the apostle paul come walking toward me onto the bridge
4441726 you might be wondering how i knew immediately that it was paul i just perceived it by divine knowledge and revelation people have asked me what he looked like and so i will attempt to describe his appearance he was short not more than 5 1 or 5 2 im 5 6 looking very jewish with a short trimmed white beard my first thought was of a monk in a monastery he actually had jolly cheeks and i thought paul youve got a little weight on you i mean he wasnt fat but he looked a little pudgy
4441727 but i suppose im one of those who is moderately skeptical these things are rarely black and white
4441728 im sure the demands of that kind of life can be extreme putting pressures on families
4441729 pray for us as we walk the land carrying the precious ark of his healing presence for his glory into those fields white and ripe for harvest more details will be forthcoming
4441730 i guess its about the ability to zone in on stuff you like in this massive library of everything connected to emotions i have collected
4441731 well imagine that every movement of your eyes face your body every word you say is a block of emotional tetris except the lines completed dont get removed it builds up you see i can feel you are not really seeing it so close your eyes and imagine it
4441732 all right well then imagine that anothers persons reaction is a target and you are building a row there with these emotional lines of tetris yeah now humans have this ability of perhaps haveing a faint guess witch way to build a road and trying to put down lines
4441733 normal people tend to fuck up a ot building these lines so they have to start over and over again risking their target moves you see its a fawed system but it obviously works we are not extinct hehe
4441734 now imagine that you have a perfect point of view so clear that you know exactly where to build your road where to get emotionally in another person for them to act in a certain way to be able to build your tetris without a flaw witch implies a strength that actually moves your target to the end of your road do you understand thats infinite power
4441735 now you know its true tell your boss that the merger is not going to be complete without updated technical specifications on the server carousel and without it your company would be technically vulnerable and wide open for industrial espionage wich could lead to your company being bankrupt in less then six months hell wont bother you then if you want to know more come buy me a drink
4441736 he has turned the revival over to pastor stephen strader of ignited church
4441737 the lords blessings and abundance have been so evident on the ministry during this season of intense activity and we rejoice in seeing and being able to participate in what we believe is only the beginning of a worldwide awakening it is with considerable sadness then that we must temper the jubilation we know you all feel with the sobering news that todd and shonnah bentley are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah nor has there ever been undoubtedly the pressures and the burden of the outpouring which approaches 144 days on august 23rd have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in their relationship
4441738 these outpourings in lakeland reached a peak attendance of 10 000 during the tent meetings and they are currently averaging about 600 to 700 attendees each evening
4441739 we are still fully committed to our crusade in uganda africa later this month and though todd will not be in attendance our fresh fire team and associate ministries will lead a team of almost one hundred people from around the world to share the love of god the power of the gospel and humanitarian aid with the people of uganda
4441740 i had to be obedient to the lord sir but i believe that colon cancer is coming right out of your body now
4441741 i am going to have to come down on the side of the negative i am against what he bentley is doing for several reasons
4441742 i believe it threw more light to emotion than it did to doctrinal standards
4441743 i looked at it very closely because i actually had some folks who went to it and i had to deal with them going up on the stage and they didnt get healed for whatever reason and it created a lot of stir and controversy within my church
4441744 one of the biggest issues i have with it is that it makes god a means to an end and not the end people come from all around the world to receive healing and they come from all around the world to get what they wanted which was healing or a better life and god became a means to that end instead of god being the end god should be the end of everything whether we have good health a good marriage and so on
4441745 god is not a link in the chain to get you what you want hes not a lucky rabbits foot hes not magic genie in a lamp he is god whether we have good health or not
4441746 a lot of the things i watched on the broadcasts were nothing more than pumping up peoples emotions
4441747 there is no revival to it revival is returning to the holiness of god i dont see any bars being shut down in lakeland i dont see any fruit from it as far as the town turning back to holiness and righteousness
4441748 i think what you have in genuine revival is you have powerful expositional preaching and the preaching emphasizes an esteem for christ an eternal perspective and a focus on essential christian doctrine as opposed to what you find in counterfeit revivals with its excesses airs and extremes which are i suppose personified in todd bentley as much as anyone ive seen in recent history
4441749 i think we have a misplaced sense of revival in that we are looking for revival in all the wrong places
4441750 todd bentley was there only one of the four nights that i was there
4441751 that service was a slightly different evening they had planned on having a baptismal service and 3 000 people lined up to be baptized it was amazing the focus that night really was not so much on physical healing but on healing from drug and alcohol abuse
4441752 i know ive been praying for a revival for a long time what i mean by revival is seeing people coming to christ in large quantities ive studied about revivals so i understand that is not all there is and that a lot of times revival was first about reviving the church so the church can then go out and win people
4441753 what i went for and what i feel like i came back with was a renewed sense of purpose and an excitement that god is going to move not only in the church but in reviving the church so that we can reach out to society

4441763 we would offer that this communications strategy of making unannounced cuts was specifically intended to minimize negative reaction from industry stakeholders
4441764 a critical role in attracting people business and investment and in distinguishing our country as a dynamic and exciting place to live and work
4441765 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal
4441766 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4441767 any implication otherwise is an absolute lie balthazars affair has been utterly devastating to rosetta and her family
4441768 yes theyre living separate lives at the moment because of his shenanigans
4441769 its disappointing that getty and miller are flaunting this so publicly there are four children involved their oldest cassius is mature enough to understand somethings not right

4441784 hablar es una actividad dirigida a entendernos y con cuanta m s gente mejor
4441785 mi criterio es que sin nimo de revancha se averiguara la verdad por completo para honrar a los muertos y para que nunca m s pueda repetirse un accidente de esa naturaleza por las mismas causas que aquel se ocasion
4441786 ahora se sabe mucho m s de lo que se sab a
4441787 lo que hice fue averiguar una verdad que cuando llegu al ministerio hab a sido ocultada y lo hice porque me lo pidieron las familias de los que hab an muerto cuyos cad veres les hab an sido entregados con falsedad y hasta hubo que desenterrarlos lo que he hecho y volver a a hacer es ayudar a los familiares a conocer la verdad
4441788 federer is the best player in the world unfortunately we got stuck with him playing unbelievably well i am still trying to figure out what we could possibly have done
4441789 its just too bad that we couldnt pull through on what is indias independence day today
4441790 we are convinced that as an organisation we might not come out clean on the bombing issue destruction is not the solution and anyone with a grievance should come to my office so that it will be addressed
4441791 not complain when you fight for 18 hours for nothing
4441792 lets have a monster that people can log in and find out is being fought and come join also i would like to point out this is a pop mob which makes for much more realistic planning around the idea of shifts
4441793 av while allowing for that type of battle is not designed for that as their own video showed the video square enix gave to us explaining how to kill it gave us one of 2 possible solutions and after 3 years shows just how vague and dismissive ses dev team can be either you cheat using dev commands multiple 2hr ability use in under 2hours or a 10 hour battle
4441794 warden isnt setup to allow lots of different people around the world to help kill it you get 18 people no more think of it as a ks99 fight in terms of how people enter the zone to kill it
4441795 lets have a monster that people can log in and find out is being fought and come join
4441796 maybe if they were good at the game it wouldent take them 18 hours
4441797 oh neat that would be great if ffxi had that

4441806 we do not permit people to take electronic devices in the testing centre as these may corrupt the good function of computers and because the pmp exam is delivered under strict security measures we offer the pmp exam on the computer based or paper based form
4441807 it brought back memories of when i was at school and when id first lost my sight
4441808 ive never really felt comfortable with other people reading to me ive never felt comfortable having to ask people again and again if i didnt understand something and because id been working and studying for more than 10 years using computers and audio speech to actually go backwards 12 years in time and depend on another person to read the exam i just found it really painful and quite upsetting
4441809 the reader would take my finger and try and invisibly draw the diagram and i would try and remember the way it was laid out and try to keep all the information in my head
4441810 i found that quite hard because i like working with tactile diagrams i work with them all the time
4441811 technically it was possible and very simple to sit the exam in a way that was more accommodating to my needs but because of some peoples attitudes i wasnt able to do it and i had to do it in this way that made me feel dependant and disadvantaged i was kind of upset and cross and quite scared because i wasnt sure how it would actually turn out in the end
4441812 applies only in relation to employment at an establishment in great britain
4441813 but the claimant is within the jurisdiction in that she worked in england and the exam which caused difficulties took place in scotland
4441814 in my view the fact that the respondent was in a position to make arrangements within great britain for the claimant to pursue a course and potentially receive a qualification from them in great britain meant that they became persons who moved within the jurisdiction of the legislations
4441815 the place where the claimant suffered the alleged less favourable treatment was within the jurisdiction of great britain and as such her complaints are ones that can be heard by the tribunal
4441816 a blind person in the uk could argue a right to sue a us company in a uk court for discrimination if the us company has a website that is not accessible to him and he can show that that us company has taken orders from other uk consumers
4441817 the tribunals reasoning could be influential on a court though it wont be binding
4441818 there is a possibility that the judgment might usefully inform a court considering a part 3 web access case as to whether jurisdiction can be made out where that provider is ordinarily based outside of great britain but is providing access to goods and services within great britain through a website
4441819 this is a similar situation to sam latifs case in that she was accessing an internationally recognised qualification provided by an overseas company albeit through means that involved some delivery in the uk likewise people ordering goods within great britain are likely to have them delivered by whatever means might be used by the company who are selling those products via the website but the website itself may not be accessible and in those circumstances a court might determine that they are liable
4441820 im sure it needs further legal argument in a particular case before were any the wiser as to whether that does or does not amount to something that the dda captures in terms of its coverage
4441821 a qualifications body should consider as part of a proper assessment the circumstances of the individual disabled person rather than treating him or her as part of a more general class e g the blind
4441822 not simply a duty that is weighed up in relation to each individual disabled person who wants access to a service providers services
4441823 provision criterion or practice or arrangement for the purposes of determining upon whom to confer a professional or trade qualification
4441824 it is clear from the evidence that pmi thought that once it had put forward adjustments that it considered appropriate that was an end of the matter and no further suggestions would be considered
4441825 what is lacking in that approach is any degree of flexibility of being prepared to listen to the claimants views and wishes or to look into or consider alternatives once a view had been taken
4441826 the more laborious verbal instructions to the reader recorder actually employed in the exam
4441827 the respondent has not established that it took all such steps as were reasonable in order to prevent the claimant being put at a substantial disadvantage by their practice of exam questions being read by candidates in a test centre and thereafter recording their answers
4441828 this whole trauma had been going on for many years now
4441829 it all started a long time before i decided to take legal proceedings id been experiencing so much frustration from the outset i felt every request i made for a reasonable adjustment was not given the right consideration and the people i was in contact with seemed as if they didnt have responsibility or experience to help me
4441830 it was slightly surprising that that wasnt taken further in order to get a more definitive ruling perhaps if that was necessary from the employment appeal tribunal but they may well have and this is conjecture on my part they may well have thought that the ruling was pretty definitive and further clarification from the eat wasnt necessary

4441834 die vorstellung einmal eine sternsschnuppe zu werden nimmt mir die angst vor dem tod
4441835 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4441836 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4441837 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4441838 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4441839 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4441840 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4441841 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4441842 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there

4441870 kami kecewa selaku kuasa hukum pemohon pemberlakuan pasal 310 311 316 dan 207 itu kan menakutkan apa tidak lebih baik bila ada kasus pencemaran nama baik menggunakan cara mediasi arbitrase atau perdata untuk menyelesaikannya
4441871 memang tidak 100 persen sama istilah coach di sini lebih bisa dipadankan dengan kata mentor ketimbang pelatih meski teknik yang digunakan kurang lebih sama yakni menggali sesuatu dari dalam diri seseorang untuk mencapai target tertentu
4441872 ya seperti atlet tadi yang dibantu coach nya untuk menemukan sendiri sebatas mana kemampuannya sehingga target prestasinya dapat terukur
4441873 namun jangan dibayangkan salah satu pihak lalu mengatakan pada pasangannya bahwa yang dimaksud dengan bahagia adalah seperti ini ini ini yang seperti itu sih bukan teknik coaching life
4441874 seorang yang berperan sebagai coach justru terus merangsang coachee nya dengan pertanyaan pertanyaan sampai si coachee ini menemukan jawaban atas permasalahan yang bersumber dari dalam dirinya sendiri
4441875 dengan kata lain targetnya diturunkan menjadi kebahagiaan mereka berdua meski dengan kondisi yang ada
4441876 konseling harus dilakukan dengan pakar dan ada alternatif solusi yang ditawarkan sedangkan metode coaching semuanya murni bersumber dari dalam diri individu itu sendiri

4441889 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4441890 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4441891 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4441892 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4441893 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4441894 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4441895 from every quarter his friends foreign friends as well as friends within pakistan have conveyed to him that it is best for him to resign and quit
4441896 i believe he will resign and he should resign because that is the advice of his friends and that is were advised the step he will take finally
4441897 if he resigns gracefully then it could be a consideration to let him go
4441898 impeachment if it is initiated will lead to very serious consequences for him and will be very embarrassing for him as well
4441899 the army is standing by the civil government and they are committed to upholding the constitution theyve seen what happens when they violate it
4441900 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds
4441901 this is some idiot who knows nothing about kafka but writes about him as if he did
4441902 were talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
4441903 jesus of nazareth never preached hatred homophobia or segregation instead he knew to say love one another
4441904 it is false that the draft is recognizing as family the union of homosexuals what we are doing is recognizing the dignity of all people without discrimination based on race sex sexual orientation etc
4441905 lets hope now that theres been so much talk about moral incompatibilities between the new constitution and the gospel sometimes utilizing falsehoods that we also can talk with equal force about the profound incompatibility of the social situation of that inequality of that existing social injustice with the gospels
4441906 amends the california constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
4441907 proposition 8 eliminates right of same sex couples to marry initiative constitutional amendment
4441908 changes california constitution to eliminate right of same sex couples to marry provides that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california fiscal impact over the next few years potential revenue loss mainly sales taxes totaling in the several tens of millions of dollars to state and local governments in the long run likely little fiscal impact to state and local governments
4441909 the attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
4441910 the attorney generals title is an accurate statement of the primary purpose and effect of the measure
4441911 prevention is slowly getting back on the agenda we hope that this week can accelerate the process
4441912 we believe that now there is enough evidence to tell policy makers that
4441913 paradoxically it may have been that we needed all of this attention and rolling out of treatment programs before we could really seriously start with prevention
4441914 unparalleled impediments to implementing hiv prevention strategies all over the world be it related to sexual activity or substance use
4441915 may have allowed us to describe differences between the groups with greater precision than with a smaller sample size
4441916 the range of response is between 87 percent and 95 percent
4441917 if it is happening among that group of highly sophisticated physicians then it is happening elsewhere
4441918 namely those who have several underlying cardiovascular risk factors for most patients this is not an issue
4441919 if you work on those you can minimize any potential risk from abacavir if it really does exist
4441920 the fundamental right to marry part of the holding was extremely significant but the courts holding that sexual orientation is a suspect classification was stunning completely unprecedented i think it will forever change the legal landscape for lgbt people in the country its going to have a huge impact on courts in other states and ultimately on the federal courts we are now living in a different legal world because of what the court did
4441921 if we defeat this proposition as i believe we will that victory will resonate across the country
4441922 not only will marriage in california be secure but we will have demonstrated that efforts to politically exploit anti gay bias no longer work we have a chance here in california to deal a crushing defeat to the anti gay forces that have caused incalculable damage to our community for years this is our opportunity to make a difference that will go down in history books as a critical turning point
4441923 mapp has never had complete faith with the numbers we get from the cdc and the state
4441924 we have questioned their estimates for many years mapp being 20 years old this year the history of this epidemic has been that the government has not only often been behind the ball on estimates but where the epidemic was heading in the 90s we knew it was going into the black community
4441925 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
4441926 we still have bathhouses here in detroit that refuse to have hiv education in there
4441927 a year ago we were asked to leave menjos which is a very popular gay club for younger gay men in detroit and i know that backstreet the largest gay club in michigan is not doing any hiv education or prevention work
4441928 if i approach some of the main gay foundations in this country i am declined because they dont fund aids work groups like the hope fund detroit or arcus foundation kalamazoo or gill foundation colorado those are three and i believe all three of them do not fund hiv aids work in the lgbt community
4441929 i think the black gay community is coming around but they dont always have adequate resources
4441930 i dont see the glbt community doing enough to support that community i mean we have discussions and panels and roundtables about it but we dont really do what is necessary a lot of times that means rolling up your sleeves and going into the community
4441931 we encourage people to dare to be themselves and live the way they want
4441932 over the past decade kosofsky has been a zealous promoter of bizarre lifestyle choices here in michigan most notably by leading the
4441933 my sister was gay my best friends were gay so i figured i had to be gay
4441934 so i did everything they did i tried kissing girls but it didnt feel right for me and eventually i was forced to come out as a heterosexual
4441935 when i hear people like george bush talk about the gay community being anti american it makes my blood boil
4441936 because im noticed as an actor people are aware of whats happening in my life im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that then you can look around and say i really deeply feel like im in love with this person there are people who feel the same thing and those models are normal the normal couples were sort of in the shadows for the past 15 or 20 years because you sort of needed other people to come forward and speak out
4441937 ive been a fan of his since season one of the mole
4441938 listen no one can tell anyone how big their steps should be or when they can take them you can take issue with someone making overtly denying statements and you can take issue with people straight up presenting themselves as someone that theyre not because i think thats kind of shady and not very stand up but you cant fault someone for going through the process at their own time
4441939 none of my friends have cars and neither do i so this is probably actually the only affordable thing in new york city
4441940 my home life was extremely different from my friends in the fact that they didnt talk about sex education with their parents
4441941 none of them because my mother was an hiv aids counselor this was very out in the open for all of us
4441942 if my mother were straight i think i would have known i was gay
4441943 but because being gay was so normal i dont think it dawned on me well until i was an adult
4441944 it was a huge issue and i remember being really really upset by it
4441945 i remember thinking about what was going to happen we were just starting to drive and what if we got into an accident what if something happened
4441946 thats the first time it really hit me that we have really unjust laws on the books that make our families second class families
4441947 sean was an amazing policy director and just a great individual
4441948 the magnitude of following in his footsteps is not lost on me at all
4441949 the issues of safety and security and freedom from violence intimidation and discrimination for all our community members is paramount
4441950 i cannot believe when i read something that says there was a 133 percent jump in hate crimes in michigan in our community that is just shocking
4441951 im not so sure that many people in detroit or other areas of michigan would share that same sentiment where they could just walk down the street and hold hands and not be in fear
4441952 when i go home to detroit on vacation people will remind me to be careful and that i cant just do whatever i think when i get there i will pay more attention i think its going to be obvious that im not in manhattan anymore
4441953 in spite of whats happening i still believe in my city
4441954 and its not just the city but all of michigan i believe that we can come on board i believe that we can make equality a reality in michigan
4441955 i dont see moving to michigan as a sacrifice because i want to share with everyone there what ive learned here and i want to work hard to make our community equal in not only the eyes of the law but also in the community in our neighbors
4441956 frankly you are asking us to venture into uncharted waters
4441957 what it came down to was in michigan same sex marriages are not recognized
4441958 our marriage engagement and anniversary announcements are part of our news hole to say someone was engaged to be married when that cant happen legally were uncomfortable with that
4441959 you might as well just throw gay couples under the bus and cite state law
4441960 its insolent that we cant be treated as an equal member of this community
4441961 print vop letters on any firms business practices including our own
4441962 thats just a downright lie and she has no valid argument
4441963 if its the press thats creating the roadblock where do we as the people have to go
4441964 its going to be subjective and im not going to pretend its not
4441965 you can say a previous letter was about a business practice but its one that reaches the level of news
4441966 whether we run it in the news pages or advertising pages wed get a reaction im not ducking an inevitable reaction
4441967 i just know its not right im really tired of people who for whatever reason dont think they have to recognize our relationship
4441968 we didnt have a policy and still dont have a policy
4441969 if a couple were from jackson and were going to get married in california or another state that recognizes gay unions wed have to look at it again
4441970 were taking the matter on a case by case basis
4441971 there are all these papers who do print announcements but many of them havent gotten them before
4441972 the flip side is that people think they cant print their announcement because theyre never seen one in the paper before
4441973 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
4441974 statistically it is not plausible that none of them are gay sadly the fact that none has come out signals that they feel the fire brigade environment is not accommodating to gays and we have to change that
4441975 mapp has never had complete faith with the numbers we get from the cdc and the state
4441976 we have questioned their estimates for many years mapp being 20 years old this year the history of this epidemic has been that the government has not only often been behind the ball on estimates but where the epidemic was heading in the 90s we knew it was going into the black community
4441977 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
4441978 we still have bathhouses here in detroit that refuse to have hiv education in there
4441979 a year ago we were asked to leave menjos which is a very popular gay club for younger gay men in detroit and i know that backstreet the largest gay club in michigan is not doing any hiv education or prevention work
4441980 if i approach some of the main gay foundations in this country i am declined because they dont fund aids work groups like the hope fund detroit or arcus foundation kalamazoo or gill foundation colorado those are three and i believe all three of them do not fund hiv aids work in the lgbt community
4441981 i think the black gay community is coming around but they dont always have adequate resources
4441982 i dont see the glbt community doing enough to support that community i mean we have discussions and panels and roundtables about it but we dont really do what is necessary a lot of times that means rolling up your sleeves and going into the community
4441983 we have seen southgobi energy resources become the newest coal producer in mongolia and report impressive ongoing exploration success greatly increasing its high quality coal resources as it prepares to make its first export shipments to buyers in china
4441984 we believe that ivanhoe australia will become a significant copper and gold producer in a district that also has significant additional potential for uranium zinc silver and cobalt
4441985 it is a peoples agitation and we must not allow it to get out of hand
4441986 pelting stones at paramilitary bunkers becomes a reason for them to shoot at protesters this must stop
4441987 after that list is issued people would boycott those policemen and their families
4441988 it is high time the kashmir issue is finally resolved in line with the aspirations of the people it is totally a peoples movement and nobody can stop it now
4441989 from every quarter his friends foreign friends as well as friends within pakistan have conveyed to him that it is best for him to resign and quit
4441990 i believe he will resign and he should resign because that is the advice of his friends and that is were advised the step he will take finally
4441991 if he resigns gracefully then it could be a consideration to let him go
4441992 impeachment if it is initiated will lead to very serious consequences for him and will be very embarrassing for him as well
4441993 the army is standing by the civil government and they are committed to upholding the constitution theyve seen what happens when they violate it
4441994 personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
4441995 hopefully that will drive us on to more success this season it is harder in the sense that all the other teams have improved and are getting better weve been champions two years on the spin and are even more of a scalp so teams are really up for it we managed to overcome that challenge last season and that success drives you on i think we will improve this season as well as other teams and its who can do it over the course of a season weve managed to do it the past couple of years and its the test to do it again
4441996 the big clubs are always going to be in there towards the end of the season and it is really tough
4441997 those type of things are won and lost on really small things as we saw in the final last year so you need that bit of luck weve shown we can do it once so we will try to do it again if we were to do it again this season two years in a row it would be absolutely incredible but weve got to perform and see how far it takes us
4441998 did they meet him talk to him or somehow mechanically using ooc means know or just assume he was from mordor

4442004 botswana does not accept the result of the june 27 run off election in zimbabwe as it violated the core principles of sadc the african union and the united nations
4442005 we are travelling to south africa with president mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4442006 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4442007 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4442008 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate

4442023 negative energy doesnt produce anything positive thats just the truth its not me its booing the guy thats out there working hard busting his butt thats when i really get upset

4442114 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
4442115 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
4442116 that is my sense because the democratic leaders in the house are proposing no resistance whatsoever paul said
4442117 we saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for 107 billion for the war the democrat leadership gave them 162 billion

4442151 he has a good feel for dealing with people he was more militant when he was younger
4442152 now he knows how government works and his organizational skills are better and he knows how to make friends with his opponents
4442153 the idea of going to the fda and getting psychedelic drugs approved was never seriously pursued by the drug reform movement
4442154 i cant take the visions he proposes and walk over to a congressional office with them
4442155 rick stands alone with his childrens access positions theres almost no real support for that anywhere

4442158 its amazing to me the number of people who smoke marijuana and hide it from their kids because its illegal education is the real key its essential this should be a decision of the parents not the government prohibition denies parents the opportunity to have an honest conversation with their kids about making responsible choices
4442159 decreased fear and anxiety increased openness trust and interpersonal closeness
4442160 these people become very sleepy theyre almost not present and it doesnt completely eliminate the pain
4442161 but the combination of mdma and opiates brings people back to alertness and then opens up their access to their emotions and reduces pain
4442162 but will it present a clinical value that significantly exceeds what we already have out there i dont think mdma is unique or that it will produce a magic bullet
4442163 ten million dollars aint gonna do it hell need hundreds of millions of dollars even if hes allowed to keep going
4442164 i think people are ready for a new conversation about the therapeutic value of psychedelics

4442176 owners will enjoy a truly hassle free hawaii vacation home experience
4442177 with professional property management in place our owners have scheduled maid service dedicated concierge and activities planning use of a vehicle and pay only a fraction of the cost of traditional ownership
4442178 in this way all of the benefits of deeded fractional ownership are enhanced by having the flexibility to vacation in other prime locations and at different times throughout the year
4442179 because the majority of hawaii second home owners use their property less than three months annually there is no question that fractional ownership is a trend that will become very common place in the years to come

4442185 ich bin mein eigener manager und glaube dass ich mein geld besser anlegen kann als es f r die meisterschaft auszugeben
4442186 meine rennkarriere werde ich deswegen nicht aufgeben ganz im gegenteil ich freue mich schon auf die zukunft und werde mir gedanken machen wie ich dem rennsport erhalten bleiben kann
4442187 im gegensatz zu vielen meine konkurrenten auf diesem level habe ich keinen manager das hei t ich kann eigenst ndig entscheidungen treffen und dann auch dazu stehen
4442188 diese entscheidung ist sicherlich eine harte aber f r mich ging es im rennsport schon immer darum der schnellste zu sein ich will am ende immer der sieger sein ich fahre nicht um der puren freude willen ich teile mit meinen sponsoren und fans einige ziele und vorstellungen diese entscheidung mag unklug erscheinen wenn man bedenkt dass ich aktuell auf dem sechsten rang in der gesamtwertung liege aber das hat nur mit meinem motto zu tun denn gewinnen ist f r mich einfach alles

4442200 in order to write a provocative autoethnography one must come to recognize that not all cultures see or describe the world similarly each culture looked at critically can be seen as working according to unique systems of belief action or ethnic autoethnography then is a demonstration of critical self understanding of self influenced the confluence of innumerable social and natural forces autoethnography texts are what are usually thought of autochthonous fons of expression or self expression

4442208 are positive steps aimed at strengthening relations in the interests of both countries
4442209 whatever is the courts judgment some of them would not be satisfied it is not far fetched that such dissatisfaction would further impinge on the fluid security situation in mindanao

4442214 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4442215 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
4442216 the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth
4442217 circumnavigation is a case of traveling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
4442218 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4442219 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4442220 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4442221 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4442222 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4442223 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4442224 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4442225 it is not a good situation when rescue comes to dead people we must ensure our security from the very first hours of a possible conflict

4442230 the presidents decrees on the black sea fleet will of course be implemented on the territory of ukraine
4442231 the defense ministry and the general staff are among those state bodies responsible for this task
4442232 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia
4442233 russia has never made a secret of its desire to retain its presence in sevastopol after 2017
4442234 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4442235 i knew at that moment that i was going to give it everything i had
4442236 i know i had so many doubters over the last few years with my injuries and people thinking that i was older than the other girls but i proved everyone wrong when i came out here and i feel stronger than ever

4442240 traditionally the long and lean gymnasts have lost out to the more solid ones

4442243 a great milestone in the history of the two countries
4442244 we are saddled with the painful but most important task of handing over bakassi to cameroon we have commitments to the international community to promote peace and brotherliness between our countries
4442245 it is believed that if african leaders observe the rule of law the continent will be a more peaceful place
4442246 historic moment showing brotherly celebration of cooperation between the two countries
4442247 we in the un are happy about the handover what is important is that the handover is done at last
4442248 it has helped to douse tension generated by the ceremony
4442249 it is a wise decision and i think there must be good reason for it
4442250 after the handing over there will be buses and escort to convey you to the new bakassi for you to conduct interview
4442251 a good number of the senators were there at the national assembly when former president obasanjo and his cameroonian counter part were negotiating this issue why did they not shout only for this injunctive order to be issued at the wee hours of the day why didnt they tell the whole world their position then a good number of them were busy looking for a return to the national assembly
4442252 this was an exceptionally strong sale and certainly stronger than we could have anticipated
4442253 we had a brilliant response from vendors which forced us to extend it over two days and that format has worked very well
4442254 this follows on from the success of the great southern sale and it means vendors and buyers now have two great opportunities in victoria to trade stock before the beginning of the breeding season
4442255 they want me to play and thats what im about i want to play football
4442256 its a local game massive for us weve got to get ourselves off the mark
4442257 the situation is a complete disgrace to democracy and the rule of law
4442258 throughout the case there was laxity on the part of the agf in filing the defense of the federal government this showed that he had made up his mind to flout the court order
4442259 it is also a surprise to us as nigerians that he is the one advocating that nigeria should obey the judgment of the international court of justice while disobeying that of the nigerian courts where he had been practicing for well over 20 years
4442260 a catastrophic assault on the territorial integrity of nigeria and its citizens in bakassi
4442261 my feeling is that we are the unfortunate victims of high wire international conspiracy and politics which has to do with the oil and gas resources in bakassi but the ordinary fishermen in bakassi are not really interested in the oil and gas their heritage is more important to them
4442262 therefore i suggest that nigeria and cameroun take the oil and gas out of the equation in bakassi and under the un and other witnesses and negotiate a joint exploitation agreement similar to what nigeria has done with equatorial guinea
4442263 social protection for all a pre requisite for consolidating democratic governance the role of trade unions
4442264 you can only be accurate if you seek clarification to the information that is made available to you by consumers and service providers bearing in mind that to every coin there are two sides
4442265 ghana cant afford to build a gold mine inside one of our last remaining forest reserves
4442266 many threatened species occur in the reserve the forests are also important for communities and livelihoods and for the areas water supply
4442267 our party we believe has the best presidential candidate to lead the country and ghanaians are fully convinced that hes the next president come january 7 2009
4442268 with that background and experience he would be very competent to meet the challenges
4442269 though we receive government budgetary support this is not adequate and regular we appeal to corporate organisations and well meaning individuals support the home

4442295 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy

4442303 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4442304 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4442305 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4442306 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4442381 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4442382 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4442383 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4442384 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4442385 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4442386 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4442387 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4442388 want het is het laatste seizoen met 18 clubs vanaf 2009 zijn er nog 16 ploegen en play offs toch revolutionair
4442389 het nieuwe systeem zal weinig invloed hebben op de manier van spelen bovenin maar de strijd voor het behoud dat wordt w l zenuwslopend met twee rechtstreekse dalers en twee mogelijke dalers
4442390 in het slechtste geval zakken dus mogelijk vier huidige eersteklassers
4442391 en het zal bijzonder moeilijk worden om uit tweede weg te geraken bovendien is het verschil op financieel vlak enorm
4442392 dat kan voor veel paniek veel ontslagen en veel transfers zorgen het wordt een gevecht op leven en dood om in eerste klasse te blijven
4442393 de trainers mogen dan wel een charter hebben ondertekend om offensief voetbal te brengen maar er zal meer worden verdedigd dan ooit de bekende veilige middenmoot bestaat immers niet meer
4442394 eigenlijk is ahmed hassan de enige vedette die ging al kan milan jovanovic ook nog gaan
4442395 ten eerste zijn de clubs financieel sterker geworden dankzij het verbeterde tv contract ze kunnen hun sterspelers beter betalen
4442396 ten tweede staat onze competitie niet meer zo hoog aangeschreven in het buitenland met andere woorden het is goed dat die goeie spelers bleven maar het is tegelijk een teken aan de wand
4442397 ik heb alle ploegen zien spelen in de voorbereiding en ik moet zeggen anderlecht brengt het slechtste voetbal van allemaal
4442398 het draait vierkant en bovendien incasseerde het een enorme dreun tegen bate
4442399 bovendien is frutos weer out en moeten de vervangers zich nog aanpassen in de spits heeft anderlecht dus een gigantisch probleem
4442400 de wedstrijd tegen cercle wordt cruciaal maar goed op termijn zal anderlecht hier ook weer uitgeraken maar het zou wel een tijd kunnen duren
4442401 standard foto fellaini is de grote favoriet het is ingespeeld en de jongeren zijn n jaar ouder die zijn dus wijzer en sterker standard heeft nog steeds alles techniek fysiek kracht en variatie
4442402 enige kanttekening wat als het eens wat minder loopt zullen de jongens heimwee hebben naar michel preudhomme laszlo b l ni is blijkbaar heel streng en kritisch
4442403 club brugge heeft oplossingen gezocht voor de problemen van vorig seizoen
4442404 het miste toen creativiteit snelheid en goeie flankspelers het heeft nu nabil dirar en ronald vargas maar die zijn blessuregevoelig
4442405 de ploeg draait ook nog niet ik denk wel dat de druk goot is want voor het derde jaar op rij is flink ge nvesteerd sinds het vertrek van trond sollied wacht club op een titel dat is lang
4442406 ik verwacht veel van gent preudhomme foto zal de ploeg beter slimmer en gevarieerder laten spelen ik denk ook dat hij bryan ruiz nog veel beter gaat laten spelen
4442407 weve being doing this word dance together for some time i know
4442408 a game until its played amp if its lost it cant ever be saved
4442409 is up to me and you so if you will i will stop saying i wont start saying i do
4442410 oh yea everyone has one nowadays and i want one too dammit
4442411 i never really had a journal or a diary before this would probably make an interesting collections of thoughts to look back upon ten years from now
4442412 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4442413 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4442414 things should be fine but theyre not things should be fine but were not happy really not happy at all
4442415 ch ik heb heel de voormiddag verhuisd in het stof en op weg naar hier ben ik in een plensbui geraakt en daarna liep ik in het park en sprong er toch wel een eekhoorn in mijn haar zeker gelukkig dat ik die daar weg heb kunnen halen voor hij een nest bouwde jammer dat ik wat in het wilde weg heb moeten knippen met mijn nagelschaar want hij zat wat vast met zijn klauwen
4442416 vindt gij ook niet dat het eens dringend tijd wordt dat ik naar de kapper ga want met mijn haar in deze staat durf ik niet meer op straat komen

4442423 the mayors attorneys did not object to this thursday order
4442424 the matter with mayor kilpatrick is dragging down the business and the hopes of the city
4442425 we strongly urge the mayor to step aside and address his problems
4442426 his issues are holding the city hostage detroits future is bigger than the mayor
4442427 one and done its the olympics so i feel great i pulled an intercostal muscle on monday so every time i breathe it hurts ive been getting lots of therapy the last four days so its feeling better its absolutely great out there itll be a great event tonight its a long day and will be a longer night
4442428 i felt great i got a good throw off and made it through no problem throwing this early in the morning my goal was definitely to get one throw get home and get some rest ive got to make sure im ready for tonight
4442429 it went pretty good i took the first throw too easy the second one was better ill come back this evening and really tie one on i was throwing really well in warm ups over 22 meters
4442430 the hamstring it feels good i felt a little sluggish in the first round but my bodys woke up now
4442431 i felt great to get in the top three and advance that was my goal and thats what i did im satisfied my main threat was france and great britain so i knew if i was running with them id be okay i feel very good i wouldnt come here if i didnt think i could medal they bought me a plane ticket for a reason
4442432 i felt controlled i had a good start everything is feeling good
4442433 i didnt feel myself out there its never good to judge how you feel from the gun but from the gun i didnt feel like i had that gear im not happy with my performance i just didnt have it today i put myself in good position but it just didnt work out my way today it was my first olympics i was thoroughly impressed with everything
4442434 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth

4442455 she stood up as though she was doing nothing wrong
4442456 i didnt know she was from new craigs to start with
4442457 the more she was speaking the more i knew she was sick
4442458 i didnt know whether she was a danger to anyone else but she appeared to be a danger to herself
4442459 when the police came they said she had escaped so many times
4442460 the hospital must have left her for some time on her own
4442461 i think she escaped by climbing the drainpipes at new craigs i dont know how her family feel about it if it was me i would be unhappy about it
4442462 i can handle what happened my daughter can handle it he cannot handle it
4442463 we endeavour to work with patients in new craigs in as therapeutic an environment as possible and in the least restrictive way according to the severity of the patients illness
4442464 we appreciate the anxiety that this incident must have caused and we very much appreciate the sensitive way it was handled
4442465 we will be writing to the family to apologise we continue to work closely with northern constabulary on the issue of patients who leave hospital and are considered missing until we know they are safe
4442466 maybe the cinema of dreams will be like brigadoon and reappear every 200 years maybe never again
4442467 its transformation from ballerina ballroom venue for glorious rock bands 40 years ago into disused bingo hall three months ago into cinema of dreams now only goes to show that transformation is possible any and everywhere
4442468 one of my dearest hopes is that people see the possibility for a cinema of dreams in every abandoned corner shop in every town and village in their country or dream rock venue dream exhibition space dream dance hall dream cheese shop
4442469 the possibilities are both rich and unknowable until we are on the other side of this month
4442470 there are plenty of dreams though and the collective support and goodwill and general blitz spirit of nairn has been and will be all we ever need
4442471 the pretty much unilateral enthusiasm is in itself the most profound thing about the cinema of dreams it is a balloon bouyed up by goodwill and fantasy alone like all the best things in life all heart lets just live in this moment this year and savour it for what it is
4442472 one thing i would like is for any following festival to retain a unique unrepeated character so whatever may follow will surely be different from this year anythings possible
4442473 dont worry about the future its rosy believe it but lets just say that this is a once only deal and enjoy it to the full
4442474 a couple we literally couldnt find some obscure supercamp elizabeth taylor film that joel wanted
4442475 not because of his local man status but because the kid and the great dictator are among my childrens favourite films
4442476 im sure he will appear at some point if not this year i cant quite remember why he wasnt in the final selection possibly because of our inclusion of i was born but which is silent needing accompaniment and less well known than chaplins films
4442477 the bill douglas trilogy is a true masterpiece of scottish cultural heritage i am inordinately proud to be showing it in nairn
4442478 crows the boot and palle alone in the world are intergalactic classics guaranteed to inspire wonder especially in the young and i know where im going boswell and johnson margaret rutherford and our singing day are family swoonfests for sure
4442479 a sure knowledge that there is more than enough inspiring cinema out there to last a lifetime
4442480 they were on the bench last week so no doubt they will be on the bench this week
4442481 but whenever called upon i am sure they will go on and cause havoc
4442482 the pressure is on trying to win games of football but it doesnt matter at the end of the day the style or formation we put out its about how the players adapt and cope
4442483 im a great believer that whether we are away from home or at home when we have got the ball we have got to try to get it forward and create chances
4442484 when we dont weve got to get ourselves back in position as quickly as possible and make it difficult for teams
4442485 scottish football is totally different and some top players have come here and struggled
4442486 its a different game to a lot of countries its passionate and very much competitive for 90 minutes and thats where some people cant handle the physical side so well see what dan brings
4442487 guy has played a few years in the reserves so well see how he gets on at elgin if or when it happens
4442488 it will be good for him just to be involved in trying to win a game of football every saturday in a competitive league because your are kind of in the firing line more than just playing in the reserves
4442489 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4442490 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4442491 religious education here indoctrinates fuelling prejudice against other faiths and against sexual minorities
4442492 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4442493 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4442494 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths
4442495 the values offered by religious education are needed desperately in times of aggressive and materialist individualism
4442496 cults seeking to introduce christ to the romanian people as if they havent known him for almost two millennia
4442497 i have to say sorry to dpp members and supporters with a heavy heart i let everybody down and caused irreparable damage to the party this was not my intention but i made mistakes

4442500 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4442501 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4442502 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4442503 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4442504 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4442505 what defences does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honoured georgian troops are being moved to organise a defencive line 10 kilometres away from tbilisi
4442506 sweetie youre a beautiful girl why would you even consider wearing this
4442507 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4442508 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4442509 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4442510 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time

4442599 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4442600 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

4442635 why is it only the ugly girls read this shirt
4442636 this was a vicious and frightening attack on a well liked and respected couple who were having a quiet night at home
4442637 the reason for this incident is at yet unclear but it was obvious they meant to terrify and intimidate
4442638 one man did have a bb gun which resembled an authentic pistol that was left behind in the house when they ran off
4442639 the incident happened at around 10pm that night when there would have been people out and about in the streets
4442640 we want to speak to anyone who was in or near the hawthorne square or tempest street areas and may have seen people acting suspiciously or running away
4442641 there will have been shouting which would have drawn peoples attention and we want to hear from people who heard that
4442642 we dont know what these intruders were after but they certainly subjected this couple to a terrifying ordeal

4442647 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
4442648 they will wear different apparel to signify people are friendly and happy together
4442649 rather than announcing chinas arrival as a modern dynamic country they risk reinforcing the view that the beijing government is comprised of control freaks
4442650 56 children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups

4442665 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4442666 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4442667 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4442668 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4442669 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4442670 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working
4442671 for something like that to happen everybodys head has to be on the same continent
4442672 these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus were getting on great but we want to keep that chemistry and not get burned out we dont want to be doing it just for the money because it can turn into a chore thats what happened the first time it seemed like work and it wasnt fun anymore so i figured f this ill go get a job if youre doing something just for the money i think having a job is a bit more honest than playing in a band just for the money
4442673 its like everything just merges into one nowadays everythings sounding the same the problem with the modern metal scene is people are too busy copying bands wholesale and not actually taking an influence and doing something new with it i dont think its laziness i think it just comes down to imagination and intelligence
4442674 ozzy did it and even zakk wyldes done it playing with black label and ozzy
4442675 other people have done it but as far as vocally its just me and ozzy its good company to be in hes the dude that basically created this niche i think it would be pretty grueling to do it for a full tour

4442691 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4442692 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4442693 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4442694 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4442695 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4442696 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4442697 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4442698 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4442699 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4442700 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4442701 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4442702 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4442708 based on a ruling like this according to this court we live in baghdad said slaten a lawyer who said he was speaking from a litigants perspective
4442709 in the united states of america you can be prevented from earning a living because some judge says so slaten said
4442710 we had to prove that we were likely to prevail on kevin slatens breach of contract claims we proved that in spades and the judge made that very clear in his ruling kevin slaten should pack up and go away
4442711 there is no doubt in my mind that 12 impartial residents of st louis county will examine the evidence and conclude that slaten was wrongfully terminated for economic reasons because the station is in financial straights pleban said more columns from dan caesar
4442712 this judge needs to recuse himself from any other proceedings in this case slaten said
4442713 he obviously has a dislike for me none of what he wrote is supported by any of the testimony i defy him to show me the testimony that supports what he concluded the testimony is 100 percent to the opposite
4442714 the fact that somebody can pretend we live in a communist country is enough for me to know to never sign a non compete again he said
4442715 anybody who signs a contract that has a non compete clause should have their head examined
4442716 who testified that two other station employees lied about slatens actions leading to duncan being on the air
4442717 i have no personal bias against kevin slaten and have always liked him both on air and off makovsky said
4442718 throughout this ordeal i have been hopeful that he could get gainfully employed as soon as possible in the field in which he excels in and i believe he deserves to earn a paycheck in his industry nonetheless i am personally insulted by his remarks that i lied under oath i unequivocally told the truth under oath after receiving an involuntary subpoena with no agenda in his civil lawsuit and the conversation ends there

4442782 i am ready to conquer the kwaito kwasa market i have seen a lot and it is time i showed the fans what i am really made of i know some are just going to dismiss me before even checking what i have in store but if it is the competitors then that would be suicidal for them because they could find themselves not prepared when i finally explode
4442783 a lot of people do not believe that this would be my first album they think it is the second one or something this is because i did not rush things i started with all those groups and gained the necessary experience to write good songs
4442784 it is actually about a woman who refuses to date a guy because that guy does not have money but once the guy starts making bucks the lady starts sniffing around and pestering him we should know that everybody in this world has potential in different fields and if things are not working out for me now it does not mean i will never rise
4442785 i am not trying to portray women as bad people but we have to be frank some of them would not even look at you if they believed you have not been to school this track diplomas and degrees is trying to highlight the fact that some of us might be having all those degrees in our houses but still not employed that does not mean we cannot make something of our lives
4442786 it is a fact we live in that type of world where people put material things ahead of true love
4442787 we find talk of the economy slowing further house prices dropping further retail sales tumbling further all indicating that things will get worse before they get better its no surprise that consumers expect this deterioration to affect them as individuals as well as damaging the nations overall finances
4442788 some homeowners may be able to take a philosophical view of falling property values
4442789 reflecting that any cyclical market will encounter downs as well as ups but for those who are considering moving equity for debt consolidation or other purposes the impact is perceived as both serious and unlikely to improve in the near future
4442790 even those who arent directly affected by the credit crunch and the uncertainty in the housing market know theyre vulnerable to the knock on effects
4442791 given all the negative news its perhaps encouraging to see that only 8 of our respondents who consider themselves in debt see that debt as unmanageable today
4442792 the results of our survey may not make comfortable reading but its a relief to see that people are on the whole aware that there are problems ahead in general one of the rules of debt management is that tackling a debt problem early on can make it much easier to address the key question now is this how many of those people will take action in time to strengthen their financial position reduce their debts and improve their chances of coming through this downturn with as little financial damage as possible
4442793 we are hoping for a dry day but both teams are used to the wet weather and have played in those conditions in this tri nations its a special day for monty and for all those players who are playing with him and good weather will only add to the occasion
4442794 ricky has done an outstanding job he was the difference between the teams in dunedin fourie probably has a better kicking game but both players are world class and its a good situation to have these options and this depth
4442795 milestones like this dont come around every day there have been 800 boks and every one of them has been passionate about the game percy has done it 100 times over and he has never lost that passion and drive to perform
4442796 its getting harder and harder to meet the federal targets and whether you look at subgroups or the overall scores there are going to be more and more schools that fail to meet the targets
4442797 when you look at scores like that tell me whether or not that looks like failing middle schools to you
4442798 it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively and fully participate in school the work force and in society

4442802 my weight has always fluctuated and no matter how much weight i lost through diet and exercise i have always had certain stubborn areas of fat that i just could never seem to shift during the x factor i lost just under two stone but my body was still quite a boxy shape having liposuction has completely changed my shape giving me curves in all the right places clothes look so much better on me now and i feel a lot more feminine and in proportion i am so please with the results
4442803 mya ensured i understood that having liposuction is not a weight loss solution but is more about reshaping the body making it more streamlined
4442804 i did experience some bruising and swelling which is typical of the liposuction procedure and i really started to notice significant results after a few weeks once the swelling began to go down a couple of months on i cant believe the change it has made i never thought i would ever fit in to a pair of skinny jeans and now i do and they are a size 10 12

4442829 besides apps that are used for e mail and personalized contacts and calendar were seeing some additional traction amongst crm apps sales field service there are also sparks of interest amongst inventory management and logistics apps
4442830 from a features and functionality standpoint on the crm apps organizations arent looking for the applications to do complicated algorithms rather they are looking to the mobile apps to provide field users with more customer related information such as service call information that the customer has asked for in the past and what sorts of things that a customer has purchased before
4442831 previously mobile apps tended to be focused on extending the line of business app like crm or order management
4442832 now the vendors are working on making their solutions plug into other systems easier out of the box capability to enable stronger cross visibility
4442833 besides rim there are windows mobile devices palm devices nokia devices and iphone devices that are being uses for enterprise mobile apps from what ive seen rim and windows mobile support the vast majority of mobile enterprise apps that includes e mail i think the chief strengths of blackberries include versatility and cost blackberry devices can support a variety of enterprise mobile apps on the device and device costs range from 100 200 on average
4442834 the browser is somewhat kludgy compared to the iphones browser it can be difficult to navigate and users sometimes must flywheel down to the bottom of pages to access links or enter data
4442835 i chose to put oss instead of devices because palm offers devices like the treo that operate on the windows platform
4442836 there are constraints for some handheld solutions running on different operating systems
4442837 for example oracle peoplesoft crm has a mobile handheld solution that runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry and microsoft dynamics crm runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry so if youre a buyer running those solutions as your enterprise crm apps and want to extend those capabilities out to blackberry devices that youve already rolled out for e mail you face a challenge
4442838 they offer a software layer that allows organizations to extend their crm application to multiple device types
4442839 devices definitely play a large role in managing the deployment of mobile applications from a developers perspective they must take into account the operating system and capabilities of the phone
4442840 for many developers ensuring their software is supported on many phones can be costly
4442841 sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smart phones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
4442842 even the most current mobile devices still provide a small fraction of the bandwidth screen size and memory available to desktop based applications
4442843 mobile applications must be designed to function well in such a limited environment

4443143 you hoped for large harvests but they turned out to be small and when you brought the harvest home i blew it away why did i do that because my temple lies in ruins while every one of you is busy working on your own house 10 that is why there is no rain and nothing can grow 11 i have brought drought on the land on its hills grainfields vineyards and olive orchards on every crop the ground produces on people and animals on everything you try to grow
4443144 is there anyone among you who can still remember how splendid the temple used to be how does it look to you now it must seem like nothing at all

4443147 suppose someone is defiled because he has touched a dead body if he then touches any of these foods will that make them defiled too
4443148 the lord says that the same thing applies to the people of this nation and to everything they produce and so everything they offer on the altar is defiled

4443162 we want to win we want to do it for the usa and for the team i dont think theres much more pressure than there already was
4443163 we absolutely respect and admire michaels goals but the feeling on the team is that by no means does one man come first
4443164 honestly when lezak pushed out that relay the next day guys were bringing up the fact that if lezak didnt touch out mike might not have had his eight golds its not something mike talks about no one here is racing for second place even the guys racing mike the feeling on our team is were all racing to win hes doing exceptionally well were all rooting for him but by no means is he the only one were rooting for

4443200 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise
4443201 i saw al qaeda slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
4443202 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4443203 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4443204 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4443205 why does this happen to me why does every moment have to be so hard
4443206 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
4443207 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
4443208 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4443209 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
4443210 its an odd paradox that this will shrink even further any kind of public space to talk about race
4443211 theyre voting for the end of affirmative action and they dont even know it
4443212 theyre voting for the end of race and they dont even know it

4443222 the best kids in the province that arent in beijing are competing here
4443223 ive been waking up early and watching the womens soccer team play and it inspires us to want to make it to the olympics everyone is pumped to play its a special experience
4443224 the games plant the seed of hope for greater achievement and gives them a sense of the larger events that they are all striving for in the future
4443225 we did so well the first time the province asked us to run it again a second time and keep careful track of how everything was done so we could create a template and a how to manual for future communities that want to run this event
4443226 listen you have to move off the grass and on to the dirt
4443227 cmon they arent using the sidewalk as much as you say
4443228 dont let your dog pee or poop in this area
4443229 now everyone gets to see that milk doesnt come from the carton
4443230 i cant stay at home to work a beef farm i have a job in the city
4443231 i think a lot of people are starting to realize were out here and theres a lot of farm ers still slugging long hours trying to put food on the table for everyone else
4443232 next time you have to do this competition make sure you become good friends with the guy thats holding the cow on the other side and hell milk the other side for you
4443233 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4443234 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4443235 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4443236 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4443237 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4443238 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4443239 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4443240 if i had to list the five people most responsible for the dismantling of the soviet union willis conover would be on the top of the list
4443241 willis conover has done more for america than all its ambassadors combined
4443242 there it was the a train and the great voice of willis conover i will never forget that feeling of sweet conspiracy while the barracks the country indeed the whole socialist camp was asleep i private zappner was in contact with washington and found out that over the trenches of the cold war there was normal life with great music with people who didnt want their lips and fingers busted up in any war i knew i couldnt shoot willis in fact i wrote to him and he sent me the program of voa and signed it himself since then the political officer treated me with caution and respect after all i was obviously in contact with washington and what if the situation changed one day
4443243 the ultimate paradox concerning willis conover is how widely and how well the voice of this enigmatic inward and possibly lonely person came to represent the big open dynamic creative free for all that is america
4443244 the next time i saw him was in 1976 in warsaw where i was playing with stan getz willis seemed somewhat worried that i was there and gave me some contact numbers at the us embassy in case of trouble
4443245 the police got all the best stuff theyre crookeder than us

4443258 i did my shopping for a week for 20 60 i left my purse behind so i couldnt add one or two
4443259 i had to go to the supermarket today for sour cream for the pumpkin soup we had tonight and i resisted so many things that normally i would just grab and not think about i put back the bottle of diet coke and decided having water instead would not kill me i also put back the milk as i have two bags of powdered milk in the cupboard enough to make 20 litres i put back the arnotts shapes for school lunches tomorrow instead the kids will finish off the saladas that were hiding at the back of the pantry the bread maker has been working overtime and so far so good only 4 00 or so spent so far i will probably have to grab a few things later in the week but will be keeping it to the absolute minimum good luck everyone

4443263 the single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is to change a mind
4443264 marketing is not a battle of products its a battle of perceptions
4443265 most marketing mistakes stem from the assumption that youre fighting a product battle rooted in reality all the laws in this book are derived from the exact opposite point of view
4443266 the most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospects mind
4443267 no matter how complicated the product no matter how complicated the needs of the market its always better to focus on one word or benefit than two or three or four
4443268 the essence of marketing is narrowing the focus you become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations
4443269 two companies cannot own the same word in the prospects mind
4443270 in the long run every market becomes a two horse race
4443271 delphi the win32 rad tool that isnt trying to force you into something you dont want to do
4443272 marketing effects take place over an extended period of time
4443273 keep those coupons rolling out not to increase sales but to keep sales from falling off if you stop
4443274 you have to give up something in order to get something
4443275 when you admit a negative the prospect will give you a positive
4443276 fiddlesticks corporation the leading provider of useless crapola announced today that it is incorporating xml web services technology into its line of coffee mugs
4443277 every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth positive statements on the other hand are looked at as dubious at best
4443278 in each situation only one move will produce substantial results
4443279 unless you write your competitors plans you cant predict the future
4443280 one way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of flexibility into your organization
4443281 history is filled with marketing failures that were successful in the press
4443282 successful programs are not built on fads theyre built on trends
4443283 what am i going to do with all the olive green refrigerators and orange carpeting i bought just before the fashion changed
4443284 oh great i can produce fifty gazillion cabbage patch dolls per day thatll come in handy now that nobody wants them anymore
4443285 darn it i just bought a warehouse of fruit colored translucent plastic and now i find that the next imac looks like a white desk lamp
4443286 without adequate funding an idea wont get off the ground
4443287 we seek to fill ourselves cure our aches and pains live forever
4443288 the cross suggests that this good news is the beginning of problems we would gladly have avoided the turning away from the quest for self fulfillment the ultimate mocking of our claims for goodness the principalities and powers tremble only before the cross nothing less than death will do painful full scale conversion letting go turning from ourselves and toward god
4443289 this meal the lords supper is not some magical mystery medicine we take to exempt ourselves from the hard facts of life in the world it is a way of confronting those hard facts no prayers of a tv evangelist no prayer cloth from arizona no holy oil or water no holy food no technique for self betterment no sincere social program exempts us from this death
4443290 but at the table with cup in hand even our most painful times are redeemed because this savior saves through suffering
4443291 no you can say that our god has been there before our god does not flinch in the face of evil in a hurting world where injustice still sends good ones to the cross we do have something to preach we like paul before us boldly lift up the cup and daringly preach christ and him crucified if we would follow this lord we must follow him down this narrow way of passion

4443321 menurut sk biaya 15 juta rupiah itu akan digunakan sebagai komponen dan besaran biaya penempatan calon tenaga kerja indonesia tki tapi setelah kami melakukan pengamatan harusnya biaya tidak sampai segitu
4443322 bila diasumsikan satu dollar amerika sama dengan rp 9 300 rupiah maka jumlah yang harus dibayar calon tki sekitar rp 15 689 400
4443323 salah satu contoh yang terkesan mengada ada adalah biaya peralatan dan bahan praktek yang sampai rp 4 juta lebih padahal pengamatan di lapangan saat pelatihan itu cuma menggunakan satu rice cooker ataupun setrika yang dipakai secara bergantian
4443324 yang kita harapkan dalam putusan ini ada catatan catatan khusus atau ada semacam referensi untuk insan pers bila terjadi kasus pencemaran nama baik maka mengacu pada uu no 40 1999
4443325 kalau ada pencemaran nama baik yang dilakukan pers kan sudah ada uu nya tapi tadi memang bukan bahasannya yang dikemukakan dalam kasus ini kan komplain terhadap pasal kuhp terhadap uud45 dan menurut mk pasal itu tak bertentagan dengan uud45
4443326 tapi kan kalau sedikit sedikit pencemaran nama baik ada kesan pers itu dihalangi kebebasannya kita harapkan tidak demikian
4443327 bila hal itu dirumuskan dalam uu pers maka berlaku lex specialis dirumuskan tersendiri tetapi selama uu pers tetap mengacu pada kuhp maka tidak dapat dikatakan ada kesalahan penerapan hukum

4443343 the top tier of the population is still spending and we are seeing strong results from luxury goods companies these companies are spending heavily on advertising as they know there are a lot of people out there who still want their products
4443344 the feeling we are getting is people are looking for quality perhaps a reaction to the economic downturn
4443345 instead of a quick read they want something that will last and upmarket glossies provide them with that

4443380 color creates an aesthetic emotion if its a color that the customer loves if it gives them that sense of balance and comfort theyll want it it can make or break a sale
4443381 the colors we chose had a lot to do with architecture using a premium paint for our premium cars is to enhance the exterior architecture of the car by giving it a luxurious liquid look
4443382 the one thing we were really excited about was this was the first year we were able to have a black metallic that really enhances the form
4443383 youll see in the color palette and in the paints that weve enhanced them by using different type of flakes
4443384 color and emotion are tied in together and buying a car is a very emotional thing for a lot of people
4443385 a car is really an extension of your personality an extension of who you are and how you want to be perceived
4443386 i had a client who was very successful in the insurance industry
4443387 he was kind of a gray guy he drove a very practical car and was very reserved the first thing he did when he retired was buy a red sports car
4443388 to him that car represented a change of lifestyle it was colorful sexy it was fun to drive
4443389 people might think oh its so shallow of me so they wont acknowledge it

4443400 hin is basically an import car show but it embodies the whole kind of youth culture local tulane student returned to college just as hurricane katrina hit friday september 09 2005 even half a world away on guam residents have been affected by hurricane katrina either through a friend or family member the storms fury could be felt an ocean away one person with local roots was in new orleans at the time of the storm returning to college as a sophomore at tulane university friday december 03 2004 last week the united states military held an exercise called operation resultant fury and b 52s launched from guam played a major role the operation was a three day 10 million demonstration put on by the military motorists continue to take chances with washed out flooded areas monday june 28 2004 motorists continued to take their chances crossing the pago bay bridge today while flooding in the area has significantly decreased since last night officials from the department of agricultures division of aquatic and wildlife have been posted at the site since the onset of the storm to guide and assist those making their way across the bridge thursday march 20 2003 mother natures fury from supertyphoon pongsona may have dealt a serious blow to simon sanchez high schools library but instead of waiting for the funding sshs librarian r 2002 on guam an unforgettable year part 5 guam endures triple shot of mother natures fury thursday january 02 2003 like what thousands are experiencing and seeing today trees were stripped wood and tin homes were toppled flooding was rampant downed power and telephone lines were scattered everywhere the scene left behind from chataan seemed so unreal considering many people never truly expected the storm to hit so hard sunday december 22 2002 supertyphoon pongsona left many on island with little to nothing after the storm hit the island on december 8 and while residents were picking up what was left of their homes guams businesses were also doing the same we talked to an employee of one such local business affected by mother natures wrath wednesday august 14 2002 after a month of tending to the life and safety issues of the people of guam the federal emergency management agency has shifted its efforts on guam to individual and family grant needs and mitigation as we find in this next report its these efforts that are marking the scaling down of typhoon recovery operations for guam but it doesnt mean that the work is over yet small business administration working hard to aide in typhoon recovery friday august 09 2002 typhoon damage assessment is the specialty of the small business administration which since the days following the storm have worked tirelessly to ensure inspections of damaged homes are complete and that disaster assistance is awarded to those who need it while it may have started with an application at the islands three disaster recovery centers the work to get a loan with the sba really ends right here island residents hurry to secure prime spots along marine drive to watch liberation day parade saturday july 20 2002 despite the islands dreary condition in the aftermath of typhoon chataan residents determined to continue family traditions have set up camp along marine drive in preparation for an annual guam tradition this years liberation day parade it was just last year when the common strip of marine drive near paseo loop was lined with canopies and tents with hundreds of people camping out for several days reserving their spots for a view of the highly anticipated liberation da islands rapidly growing debris collection sites are a rapidly growing concern tuesday july 09 2002 just as residents began picking up the pieces of their home landscapes and personal items in the wake of typhoon chataan it seems mother natures fury could cause even more damage with the passing of tropical storm halong a number of solid waste transition sites have seen hundreds of island residents in the past several days as the debris keeps piling up residents living near these sites are extremely concerned with the upcoming storm central guam hit hard by chataan liberation carnival area a disaster area saturday july 06 2002 in the central areas of the island flooding was and still is a major problem confronting residents many businesses were hard hit as well as homes throughout the central villages wednesday july 03 2002 while guam is preparing for what tropical storm chataan may bring our way it is continuing to intensify west of chuuk in the federated states of micronesia its a situation that not only has dropped some 19
4443401 obama that sounds like a muslim name barack obama must be a muslim
4443402 without conclusive evidence bela karolyi and our international gang have convicted the chinese girls as cheaters
4443403 but i have no problems with people digging into this and making it a scandal hurtful though it might be especially if the allegations are true
4443404 nicole saw that even a clean blanket was out of reach for some of these new moms so she wanted to figure out an efficient way to connect them with companies and individuals who want to help
4443405 we take for granted the basic necessities for some families its a serious struggle this is one way to ease the financial burden and help new babies have a good start in life we are only working with companies and products that joel and i would use were checking every product out for safety and all products are bpa free
4443406 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
4443407 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4443408 the focus of our convention to people in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4443409 all they have to do is give her immunity if they think she can help them
4443410 you cannot turn down immunity they know how to do it
4443411 there is lots of stuff going on behind the scenes without getting into the rationale i will not be pardoning or issuing immunity for anybody testifying at the hearing
4443412 yes carrington nyadombo has been at fault in most of the matches we lost or dropped points but its not entirely his fault
4443413 when the season started he actually requested that he be given more time to prepare himself for the premiership challenge
4443414 we were quite happy with that because we had planned our central defence around the experienced pair of norman togara and trymore mtisi but they betrayed us and disappeared
4443415 actually carrington made his first appearance for us against chapungu because togara did not travel to ascot otherwise the young man would not have played
4443416 in all the matches he played this was forced upon him by the coaches because of the unavailability of trymore and togara
4443417 those two together with umbro let us down despite the fact that we honoured our side of the bargain only for them to disappear
4443418 to us the three were very senior players who were supposed to guide the young team that we came with from division one but they are the ones who later behaved like the junior players
4443419 umbros contract with us expires in 2009 while togara is ours until 2010 with mtisis contract ending this year and they will all need our clearance if they are to move on
4443420 we will have no option but to request that they reimburse us the money they pocketed before disappearing that will be the only way we can clear them because to us this is fraud
4443421 ive made it a point that i check with all the clubs in the league to find out how much their players are getting and we have always been the best paying since the season started
4443422 that is why those players did not try to join other clubs because no player can walk out of the best paying team to go and earn less elsewhere
4443423 the winners of the cbz fa cup will be getting us 70 000 and we are pushing for payment to be made in hard currency
4443424 as a committee we will be meeting with zifa and the sponsors cbz holdings so that we can impress on the monetary authorities in this case the reserve bank of zimbabwe so that the winners can get their prize money as hard currency
4443425 by giving them hard currency we hope the money will help the winners when they represent zimbabwe in the caf competition next year because they will have somewhere to start from at least
4443426 the sponsor has given guarantee that all the money will be paid to the clubs immediately and this will be on the first working day after the matches have been played
4443427 it was our wish to have the clubs being paid in hard currency right from the first round but this cannot happen since its against the laws of the land
4443428 asking for a special dispensation for all teams is also out of the question
4443429 the idea here is for all the clubs to fight for the big prize the us 70 000
4443430 that is what a cup competition should be it is not supposed to reward those who lose in the first rounds but those who do very well
4443431 and genuinely i want to give a thank you to the sponsors and it is my hope that the clubs will give us real value for the investment made
4443432 all the visiting teams going out of town will be cushioned against their travel expenses with the sponsor providing fuel
4443433 as psl we are not going to take any levies from the gates but zifa will take 10 percent of the net and this was reduced from 15 percent
4443434 the levies for the sports commission remain in force because those come through an act of parliament
4443435 if we seed the premiership teams the element of surprises where lower league clubs where going to knock out the big guns was going to be minimised
4443436 its the major trend the world over that all the teams should be given an equal chance in a major knock out competition
4443437 have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives tales rather train yourself to be godly for physical training is of some value but godliness has value for all things holding promise for both the present life and the life to come
4443438 do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize run in such a way as to get the prize everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training they do it to get a crown that will not last but we do it to get a crown that will last forever
4443439 errei muito agora esperar a pr xima olimp ada em 2012 para fazer um resultado melhor
4443440 eu fiz o meu melhor agora vou descansar um pouco para o revezamento 4 x 100 m
4443441 situa es muito espec ficas num contexto de milh es de cirurgias que o brasil realiza
4443442 a desfilia o se d principalmente pela falta de democracia interna no diret rio municipal eles est o indo contra uma quest o constitucional que d direito defesa quero voltar ao partido em pocas mais democr ticas
4443443 querem usar a minha expuls o para constranger os vereadores e secret rios fui eleito bode expiat rio por ser jovem e n o ter mandato

4443445 1 will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help
4443446 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4443447 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4443448 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4443449 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4443450 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4443451 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4443452 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4443453 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4443454 that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4443455 most children in some point in their lives fantasize about travel into space or becoming an astronaut
4443456 it seemed very natural that at the very least i would want to find a way to connect to the player community during my time in space
4443457 we will leave it as a permanent archive away from the potential disaster that might befall the surface of the earth
4443458 i think there is no question that they will enjoy it at many levels
4443459 we think the players will find it both fictionally really fitting as well as just from a practical standpoint the chance to get their own data sent into space
4443460 i have a very substantial load of commercial and research activity ive actually presold the results of a lot of the commercial work that i am doing in areas like protein crystal growth that is of use to pharmaceutical companies
4443461 thats how i spend my spare time adventuring into the reality in which we live
4443462 social media companies are always going to have to be careful about the conversations that go on their networks
4443463 slander illegal acts and copyright issues are all potential risks since user generated content is by nature unpredictable
4443464 there are a number of laws out there that can be potentially violated on a social networking site
4443465 people have gotten nailed and lost their jobs when it has been discovered what they said on online industry forums
4443466 especially in the business networks the question becomes to what extent is your comment your own and to what extent does it represent the view of your employer
4443467 they write things online that they would never put on real paper
4443468 lori drew is definitely an exception however it is conceivable if someone posts derogatory pictures or writes something that could for example keep someone from getting a job or getting into college that they could be brought to court
4443469 besides apps that are used for e mail and personalized contacts and calendar were seeing some additional traction amongst crm apps sales field service there are also sparks of interest amongst inventory management and logistics apps
4443470 from a features and functionality standpoint on the crm apps organizations arent looking for the applications to do complicated algorithms rather they are looking to the mobile apps to provide field users with more customer related information such as service call information that the customer has asked for in the past and what sorts of things that a customer has purchased before
4443471 previously mobile apps tended to be focused on extending the line of business app like crm or order management
4443472 now the vendors are working on making their solutions plug into other systems easier out of the box capability to enable stronger cross visibility
4443473 besides rim there are windows mobile devices palm devices nokia devices and iphone devices that are being uses for enterprise mobile apps from what ive seen rim and windows mobile support the vast majority of mobile enterprise apps that includes e mail i think the chief strengths of blackberries include versatility and cost blackberry devices can support a variety of enterprise mobile apps on the device and device costs range from 100 200 on average
4443474 the browser is somewhat kludgy compared to the iphones browser it can be difficult to navigate and users sometimes must flywheel down to the bottom of pages to access links or enter data
4443475 i chose to put oss instead of devices because palm offers devices like the treo that operate on the windows platform
4443476 there are constraints for some handheld solutions running on different operating systems
4443477 for example oracle peoplesoft crm has a mobile handheld solution that runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry and microsoft dynamics crm runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry so if youre a buyer running those solutions as your enterprise crm apps and want to extend those capabilities out to blackberry devices that youve already rolled out for e mail you face a challenge
4443478 they offer a software layer that allows organizations to extend their crm application to multiple device types
4443479 devices definitely play a large role in managing the deployment of mobile applications from a developers perspective they must take into account the operating system and capabilities of the phone
4443480 for many developers ensuring their software is supported on many phones can be costly
4443481 sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smart phones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
4443482 even the most current mobile devices still provide a small fraction of the bandwidth screen size and memory available to desktop based applications
4443483 mobile applications must be designed to function well in such a limited environment
4443484 in addition we launched the oracle mobile business indicators to coincide with the launch of the apple app store on july 11th 2008
4443485 highly intuitive and flexible features including browse search and favorites for a superior overall end user experience
4443486 support for key erp business approval processes with rich analytical context
4443487 i have this problem in a bad way one moment ill have very strong 3g reception and in the next ill have dropped the signal and switched to edge i can barely keep a call from dropping on 3g and this is in san jose and san francisco metro not the back woods
4443488 honestly at this point im a lot happier just turning off 3g and running the thing on edge all the time battery life is much improved obviously without all the switching and most applications run at a reasonable speed most importantly calls dont drop
4443489 i really do hope i can use the 3g on my iphone 3g sometime soon though thats kinda why i bought it
4443490 its entirely possible that theres a huge problem with the chips the phones or the network
4443491 its also possible that the press is going to latch onto any problems with the iphone because writing the word iphone guarantees people read the article cell phone reception varies so i can only report on what im seeing i have used the iphone almost daily since i got it and have had bugs a lot of random slowness some minor app crashes and issues with the battery it dies before the end of the day and you cant carry a spare battery but ive had no problems with reception
4443492 it may have been a temporary glitch or volume overload
4443493 listening to your customers for a large corporation very important but why just for iphone users i am in possession of an htc diamond but say the direct counterpart of the iphone my range is dramatically bad
4443494 it is certainly not the iphone i have an mda vario iii and also has poor coverage in various places in the country
4443495 my main issue with all of this is apples complete and utter silence on the matter what would be the harm in acknowledging the issue and saying we will have a fix in short order it wouldnt hurt and most likely would garner apple more respect
4443496 wow those numbers are definitely impressive we all knew it was going to be successful but i doubt any of us would have predicted this
4443497 and this is with how shall i say a flood of less than stellar apps imagine how this store will do once it grows to include more useful applications
4443498 iinet is offering itunes content quota free which is great hopefully other isps will follow
4443499 my guess is that its not just apple its that the usage rules for online rentals are based on what the rights holders want and demand and what the infrastructure supports
4443500 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
4443501 this is one of the intelligent investments where there is no danger of environmental pollution
4443502 with just seven races remaining im still chasing that debut top 12 finish having come close so many times already this year
4443503 surely it cant be far away and id be delighted if i could achieve that on this level of machinery
4443504 to be a politician you have to be a hypocrite and a liar
4443505 i am not proud of it i am sorry to my wife and family and i will not be seeking my partys nomination for the 2008 presidential election
4443506 until last week mr edwards could have expected a prime time speaking slot at the democratic convention in denver at the end of the month now however neither he nor his wife are expected to be seen within a hundred miles of colorado

4443544 green is the prime color of the world and that from which its loveliness arises
4443545 so if you want to see what facebook looked like about three years ago you can go there at the time it literally was just facebook copied in red
4443546 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action their strategy appears to be if you cant beat them sue them
4443547 the first difficulty they run into is studivz is in germany
4443548 so facebook has sued them here on the theory that by logging in to the facebook site they agreed to be subject to suit in california
4443549 because it lets the person who executes the idea best win in the marketplace and that protects a healthy competitive marketplace
4443550 it may look like an easy thing to do but actually growing such a copycat is just as hard as building a company thats otherwise your own original idea
4443551 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt
4443552 we dont want any cease fire document to become the legitimization for russian occupation of georgian territories
4443553 we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4443554 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died and georgia whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect must be able to get back to normal life
4443555 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4443556 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we as we look ahead
4443557 and i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build and build their economies
4443558 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4443559 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4443560 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4443561 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4443562 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4443563 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4443564 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4443565 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4443566 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4443567 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4443568 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4443569 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4443570 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4443571 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4443572 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4443573 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4443574 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4443575 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4443576 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4443577 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4443578 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4443579 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4443593 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4443594 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4443595 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4443596 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4443597 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4443598 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4443599 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there

4443702 ive been going through a stretch where i was scuffling
4443703 thats just part of a long season making 33 34 starts not all of them are going to go great i worked on a few things in the bullpen got myself right and just felt a lot better out there
4443704 hes a big part of this team he can play any position and were going to need him down the stretch
4443705 it was a disappointing week it turned into a disappointing 10 days
4443706 we needed to play better and we didnt we have to find a way to get productive
4443707 after that two walks really hurt after drew got the hit it gave them a chance to have a big inning
4443708 in the morning i woke up with a little pain
4443709 when i got here i tried to play and tried to squat a few times and it was kind of painful
4443710 its not the first time weve had to make a call and get a player up the road

4443716 its unbelievable how precise everything is and how meticulous the dates and planning procedures are
4443717 to be honest i was not very happy with it in the beginning because it was just too slow for my liking but once you get used to this rhythm it grows on you
4443718 insulation the fact that electricity should come from renewable energy sources wherever possible and that the traffic will remain under the central construction that all gives us the possibility to create something different
4443719 because it was an available piece of land that was big enough but the village was small enough that it was easy to unite the old and the new in a fairly small destination
4443720 we thought lets make something small so that people dont complain about the excess
4443721 everyone for me it will only be a success when i see people coming in rolls royces and on bicycles

4443750 in every high court there are 3 4 judges who are out every evening to party in foreign embassiies or at advocates places drink dine
4443751 amounts to a pronouncement of the accuseds guilt which they have no right to do
4443752 the prosecution is entitled to kudos for pursuing the case with remarkable speed and leading it to a successful conclusion in record time
4443753 it was an attack at the heart of indian democracy we are told
4443754 although geelani did not make any confession reports in the media claimed that he had acquired rs 22 lakhs by helping in terrorist activities the media trial that followed feeding the material handed by the police made matters worse
4443755 while the death penalty continues to be used in india there remains a danger that it will be used disproportionately against ethnic minorities the poor or other disadvantaged groups there is only one way to ensure such inequalities in the administration of justice do not occur the complete abolition of the death penalty
4443756 india stands at a crossroads it can choose to join the global trend towards a moratorium on the death penalty as adopted by the un general assembly last year it will also then join 27 countries in the asia pacific region which have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice
4443757 or it can continue to hang death row inmates when the judicial system that puts them there has been shown by this extensive research to be unfair
4443758 experience shows that an impression is created in the public however unjustified it may be that it would be advantageous to engage a judges son as an advocate
4443759 it was generally believed that a b c and d all judges constituted a mutual co operative society in the sense was believed that each of the four judges a b c and d would protect the sons of the three other judges
4443760 some relatives misuse their connections more blatantly than others but the problem remains in principle an especially acute feature of problem of nepotism as it exists here is that apart from relatives of high court judges children of sitting supreme court judges from this region also practise here at chandigarh
4443761 the advantages the benefits that accrue to them from their connections is well known to all and is fully exploited
4443762 there are complaints from all over the country that judges children are practising in the same high court and that is causing grave problem in regard to handling of cases and the judges favouring and one judges son appearing before another judge
4443763 close association with individual members of the bar particularly with those who practise in the same court shall be eschewed
4443764 if your son brother or sister is practising in the same court you cant eschew close association with your son daughter or brother
4443765 therefore you should not be a judge in the same court you should opt to be transferred to some other court where a close relative is not practising
4443766 that instances have come that a relation of a judge having joined only three four years in the practise suddenly his briefs are huge in number so that is what it is under scrutiny because he takes advantage of his position
4443767 it is very clear also as i know personally so many judges in the high courts their children are practising and are being pampered also

4443787 the intent was that the building would serve as its own sign
4443788 in this case the sign is tacked on and totally alien to the building
4443789 they really dont want to live in a building thats branded as the unisys building
4443790 if we didnt get the signage wed have to re evaluate how important visibility is to us in that decision
4443791 we feel that the signs on two liberty place would mar and tarnish the building as well as the philadelphia skyline
4443792 thats why its imperative that all drivers remain safe and sober
4443793 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
4443794 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
4443795 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

4443830 i do believe that the misconduct of the members amounts to a breach of privilege i do believe that the power of parliament to punish under privilege could be stretched to include the power of expulsion
4443831 i strongly contest the position that for misconduct outside the rules of privilege a member of a legislative body should be expelled from the house
4443832 i doubt if any house of parliament is empowered to cut short a constitutionally prescribed term of its members other than for breach of privilege

4443853 we were lucky enough to get over antrim offaly and wexford it puts us into an all ireland semi final against tipp as underdogs
4443854 i never expected this to happen in my life considering that that we are a little known group back home
4443855 i dedicate this accolade to the people of zimbabwe and all those that helped us to reach this stage
4443856 the award means a lot to us first and foremost i think we were rewarded for our efforts and we hope to continue working hard as a group after we scooped the top prize
4443857 we are happy that we have done ourselves and the national proud as we settled for the top honours
4443858 we took him down to the community shield last sunday and he did some work for us then
4443859 there are clubs out there that are trying to unsettle my players and its not something im happy about
4443860 but the likes of roque steve warnock theyre all staying i dont sell my best players unless i want to sell them and roque and steven warnock are two players that i definitely dont want to sell and wont be sold
4443861 theyre staying as far as im concerned thats the end of the story
4443862 robbies done well his last game was in october so its a long long time but hes trained ever so well
4443863 hes getting his sharpness back and some of the things hes done in the last three or four days in training are absolutely mind blowing
4443864 hes still got it and he could be a very good asset for us if we decide to take him on
4443865 prescott looks dangerous but hes just the kind of opponent i need at this stage of my career to get my fear instinct to kick in
4443866 he may have been knocking them out left right and centre but im going to make him wake up and smell the coffee
4443867 ive been working on my defensive skills with new coach jorge rubio and it looks like prescott will be testing out what ive been learning in the gym
4443868 along with my strength and conditioning coach im also punching harder than ever before and i think my offensive skills are going to win my this fight
4443869 i love to entertain the crowd and i plan to go to war against prescott
4443870 i wont be hiding from him ill go after him and try and knock him out like i do with all my opponents
4443871 james is still working on his fitness and on things he can improve
4443872 fitness isnt an issue because he lives his life right but he can put in more deliveries in the final third
4443873 can he score more goals the answer is yes his finish for our winner against psv was good it was an excellent goal
4443874 i think certainly theyre fitter for a start thats probably the thing id see most of all
4443875 i think theyre in better physical shape than they have been in a while
4443876 i think theres a good few new and younger players coming into the set up
4443877 its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4443878 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands
4443879 you cant do it for them you can draw on your own experiences and tell them what it will be like and you can try to recreate situations at training we trust these boys that they will put it all out on the park this saturday
4443880 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4443881 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4443882 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know
4443883 try your best to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself and you will find that this is the shortest way to benevolence
4443884 ummmm so babe i mean it like still rises to the occasion on its own doesnt it
4443885 oh yes maam big daddy has no problems in that arena
4443886 this is a taboo subject for dudes just like implants are for women
4443887 i used those condoms that basically numb your penis so i wouldnt cum as fast
4443888 i couldnt feel anything it was literally like screwing a bag of hot ice
4443889 i would endure that just so i could guarantee that i did a great job the first time so she would come back for a second
4443890 if i have no sensation down there how can i stay excited
4443891 to make sure i leave a lasting impression for the long weekend
4443892 as i have gotten older my body cant perform as long as it once did i want to go more rounds than i am limited to now
4443893 it is only used for special occasions or a special woman
4443894 you just cant bring out the superman any ole time
4443895 i have only had positive experiences and she did too
4443896 only thing was that my penis was still hard first thing in the morning and it kind of hurt also
4443897 i remember the first and last time i took that shit like it was yesterday
4443898 my sisters a nurse and gets all kinds of samples from vendors so i tried viagra shortly after it came out it was around my birthday so i was planning on taking her out to eat and afterwards bringing her back to my place to set her insides on fire
4443899 my sister recommended that i take half a pill cause they were the extra strength kind
4443900 if half a pill can make me last 2 hours imagine what two whole pills could do for me
4443901 yes i stole money out ofmy mums purse when i was little to buy sweets oh god sorry mum
4443902 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
4443903 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
4443904 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
4443905 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
4443906 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
4443907 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
4443908 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
4443909 the project gives us a unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
4443910 there is no difference between the two classes except for voting rights
4443911 from a directors angle i am envisioning love abstract as a no dialogue story about a fight between husband and wife its going to be done in a way that you dont actually see the fight
4443912 by that i mean as the audience they will experience the couples emotional and physical exchange focusing on each ones point of view
4443913 casting was a little more challenging as most actors rely on dialogue to express themselves fully the actors we were looking for had to have a greater understanding of miming which incorporates body movements and gestures
4443914 i have discovered my niche and i am drawn to the arty and abstract films
4443915 as a filmmaker i am not going to hold anyones hand and take you from point a b of my film i want to challenge you as the audience so when you walk out of that theatre you to come out with your own interpretation of the story when you meet someone else who has watched it you can talk about it and have one common understanding
4443916 we had roughly 10 to 15 people who came in for the auditions a good number of popular television drama actors came through and we were impressed by some of their performances so we have short listed one or two people it was good seeing some fresh faces but in terms of finding a full cast for the film we still have to look through the recorded auditions to make sure we get it right
4443917 heart of hearts is basically about someone coming to the realisation that life is what you make it i took a character and put him in a world where they are pairs
4443918 in this world they are hearts and diamonds like a card game and how each card has its pair
4443919 in this imaginary world the main character has lost his pair and in trying to get his pair back so that he can be acceptable in this fantasy reality he realises that life is really what you make it
4443920 just because you have lost what the world around you thinks makes you more acceptable that doesnt mean it is the end for you
4443921 it is a result of a cultural exchange between a friend of mine kuno based in spain and myself
4443922 i have always had the idea of this album for a long time and what we did was to exchange ideas between the two of us
4443923 it is not only a combination of dino and kuno but also a synergy between spanish and shona and zimbabwe and spain
4443924 this came about as a need to give different professionals a platform to meet and discuss on issues of concern

4443930 some days when i walk out of my hotel i see feel and sense the delicate intricacies of life around me it glows every leaf flower and even peoples faces theres a joy in my heart and a willingness to make my life perfect in every which way then on other days everything appears intensely dark and foreboding i imagine ghosts hiding in the banana leaves and even simple words uttered by people as threatening i want to return to the hotel and go back to sleep hoping to rid myself of the negative energy my spirit is fragile and i am afraid i will lose it in bali

4443959 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4443960 reports about this have been limited because journalists either dont fully recognize the strategic significance or they are afraid of hezbollah
4443961 almost no western journalists have reported this and only a few lebanese have
4443962 hezbollah is establishing layered defenses north of the litani in the southern and central bekaa and they have reinforced their presence in southern beirut
4443963 they also have created new positions in mount lebanon and in the far north near the highest peak of the cedars mountains which means technically hezbollah which means iran controls the highest ground in the region south of turkey
4443964 hezbollah knows that he who controls the mountains consequently the mountain passes controls all of lebanon
4443965 hezbollah is also telling itself i am afraid the israelis will attack me north of the litani so i will strengthen those positions above the litani and i am not allowed to have my weapons and missiles south of the litani so i will move them north
4443966 hezbollah today is five times more capable militarily than it was during the july 2006 war

4443978 guys seem to have an innate fascination with watching demolition
4443979 add to this the science behind it and the idea of two brothers doing all the demolition physically and we think human wrecking balls is an excellent addition to our programming line up with
4443980 this landmark deal allows the sec on cbs to continue to be a cornerstone of our fall programming for many years to come
4443981 the agreement provides cbs sports with the opportunity to showcase the excitement pageantry and rich traditions of the sec across all cbs platforms
4443982 the southeastern conference is proud to continue its association with cbs sports
4443983 this national network agreement provides a unique platform to share both the athletic and academic achievements of the 12 member institutions
4443984 the sec is the gold standard in college athletics and we are proud to be associated with this great conference and its outstanding administrators coaches and student athletes
4443985 the length of this deal is a testament to the great brand that the sec on cbs has become
4443986 the southeastern conference is extremely pleased to extend its long standing relationship with cbs sports
4443987 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4443988 my interpretation is that this a feature of increased awareness in the sports world that doping is unacceptable and you dont compete in the olympic games if you are doped
4443989 its been clarified that the best way to support a sport that has a doping problem is not to throw it out but rather to help it
4443990 we hope we will be able to help the sport of cycling we hope that olympic cycling will be a cleaner sport than cycling in general is today im hopeful for the sport in the future they have to take strong action and i think everyone realizes that

4443996 and this parasite is known from the captive breeding population

4443998 we dont even know if that b schroederi is the true name of the parasite yet http louissheehan bravediary com ive got people working on its shape and the dna of this parasite to see if they can determine the proper name for it
4443999 when you get small populations of wildlife like here all it takes is a couple things acting together and you might get extinction
4444000 we now have an earthquake we have deforestation we have removal of the bamboo patches and we have a parasite with that kind of compound threat you end up with might constitute a perfect storm for panda extinction

4444060 before the credit crunch and dramatic fall in house prices many people would have relied on remortgaging as a way of raising cash to fund their lifestyle but those days are long gone and unlikely to return
4444061 for those who have no savings no prospect of extending their mortgage and no one they can approach to lend them money there really isnt anywhere left to go
4444062 admitting defeat on such a sensitive subject as money can be very difficult but theres no honour in going down with a sinking ship facing up to financial problems as early as possible is the only way of stopping things from deteriorating money is one of the biggest sources of arguments between couples so racking up interest on loans and credit cards in secret is a sure way of compounding the problem with relationship difficulties too

4444081 it seems to me that those who took out a together mortgage have been left with very few options and they are stuck on an expensive standard variable rate there is a real lack of choice out there and these people have become the forgotten few there is a danger that northern rock is focusing on paying back the loan and is forgetting the bigger picture perhaps some money could be used to help people
4444082 northern rock finds itself in a position where it will be lumbered with its higher risk borrowers who cannot remortgage elsewhere so as its lower risk borrowers move on northern rock will find its book contains an increasing percentage of the most vulnerable borrowers who are struggling to make their repayments

4444101 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the nhhelco

4444104 thats what we have calculated in terms of direct costs
4444105 given that we have been in discussions with them and nhhelco regarding the unique issues being raised by the state

4444182 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment

4444210 when im there i feel a little bit more russian until i start speaking russian and people kind of giving me looks like why you speak so badly i guess i have a little bit accent in russian
4444211 i went down there today representing both countries im competing for the us but my name nastia liukin looks exactly a russian name i hope my performance today made my family and friends proud in russia as well as in the us
4444212 my parents definitely had a big influence on my life and without them i wouldt have been here my father is the reason why i won the gold medal and on the other side my mother gave more support getting me through the tough days

4444215 back to back medical emergencies helped push her over the edge
4444216 oh when i was young i just used to loooooove insert passion here
4444217 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome
4444218 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4444219 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4444220 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4444221 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4444222 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4444223 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4444224 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4444225 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4444226 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4444227 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4444228 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4444229 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4444230 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4444231 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4444232 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4444233 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4444234 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4444235 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4444236 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4444237 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4444238 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4444239 who are open to doing something on the production side
4444240 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4444241 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4444242 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4444243 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4444244 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4444245 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4444246 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4444247 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4444248 were all breathing a sigh of relief right now even in a low turnout primary you take nothing for granted
4444249 we largely viewed it as an opportunity to get a debate going now
4444250 the common denominator issue now is the economy the interesting thing is it doesnt matter if i am talking to someone who is wealthy or poor theyre concerned about it
4444251 everybody is focused on this very unstable economy and feeling insecure
4444252 hey folks lets get out there and help out poor mr shays
4444253 dois produtores de diferentes universos se encontrando para um almo o tem alguma coisa no ar
4444254 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4444255 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4444256 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4444257 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4444258 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4444259 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4444260 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4444261 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4444262 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4444263 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4444264 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4444265 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4444266 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4444267 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4444268 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4444269 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4444270 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4444271 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4444272 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4444273 this could just be one of the most exciting cars to hit the road since well since the original mini cooper handbrake turned onto the scene sadly though the reality is anything but instead of being the best sporting mini ever created it is the least appealing ive driven
4444274 there are a few small problems you could overlook the interior is barely distinguishable from that of the standard cooper s the new badges look cheap and in the quest for more visual
4444275 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4444276 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4444277 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100 million he was very emphatic
4444278 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4444279 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as fifa president sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo
4444280 they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4444281 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer
4444282 there are two networks at terminal 3 one a legacy network the other a shiny new one
4444283 we think that a device was plugged into both networks and started to get some feedback and conflict with both of them we have identified three potential devices electrical components such as a switch
4444284 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4444285 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4444286 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4444287 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4444288 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4444289 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4444290 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4444291 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4444292 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4444293 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4444294 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4444295 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4444296 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4444297 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4444298 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4444299 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4444300 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4444301 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4444302 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4444303 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4444304 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4444305 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4444306 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4444307 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4444308 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4444309 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4444310 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4444311 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4444312 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4444313 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4444314 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4444315 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4444316 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4444317 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4444318 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4444319 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4444320 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4444321 grazie alle leggi fatte da berlusconi per salvare s stesso e i suoi sodali
4444322 its a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
4444323 very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia
4444324 the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4444325 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4444326 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency
4444327 but what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the us offered us new proposals
4444328 while china has its coming out party to the world people forget that in tibet right now theres a vicious military crackdown thats been in place since march
4444329 oh my gosh ive been up until 12 30 in the morning almost every night
4444330 but we watch it live and record it so we can go back and watch it again later
4444331 its been a long time since a swimmer has been a poster child of the olympics like this
4444332 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4444333 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4444334 its what everybody talks about when they come into the pool
4444335 weve talked about the relay where we beat france and how far michael phelps torpedoes under the water doing dolphin kicks when the rest of the swimmers are already above water and hes still down there looking up at them it just makes people more excited about swimming especially the young ones who are just learning
4444336 i just learned how to dive off the side and im practicing diving off the blocks now
4444337 this year i started to become fast and sometimes when im in a good mood and a happy mood and a confident mood i try to swim fast and good like michael phelps
4444338 usually id be out doing other things playing sports with friends or going to see a movie
4444339 but ive been staying in to watch the olympics just to see michael
4444340 i dont want someone to tell me the next day what happened i want to experience it first
4444341 to know someone just going to the olympics is so absolutely incredible and exciting but this is just hard to explain its so motivational and hes just so michael
4444342 i think the visual of seeing so much excitement about swimming combined with higher summer temperatures it makes people think about having a pool
4444343 personalmente me cae bien y le deseo que le vayan bien las cosas en su partido
4444344 el valor de las encuestas es mucho mayor cuando se encuentran cercanos los procesos electorales y querer trasladar un resultado demosc pico a unas elecciones para las que faltan cuatro a os es poco real

4444365 its a decent start but she left some points on the board
4444366 with the hurdles we just wanted to run it clean and she got a little sloppy at the end but considering it can be over before you start if you catch a hurdle it was a good race
4444367 it was a good performance especially the first half its hard to be critical of too much we did
4444368 its his ankle thats the problem so its going to be a couple of weeks at least if not worse
4444369 thats not good news for us hell have a scan tomorrow and see how he goes
4444370 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4444371 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4444372 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4444373 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4444374 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4444375 railroads are expanding mileage based fuel surcharges to apply to more and more commodities including intermodal
4444376 pc miler rail provides shippers of those commodities with an easy way to verify the accuracy of fuel surcharges as they process the railroads invoices
4444377 it is extremely important to be able to accurately estimate rail distances from dow plants to the customers
4444378 pc miler rail allows us to quickly calculate mileage and plot multiple routes on a map i find the tool user friendly and easy to use
4444379 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4444380 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4444381 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4444382 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4444383 is an overlay worth it if were unlikely to retain voyager for a significant period of time
4444384 i am looking for a place searching for your face
4444385 i m so glad that it was you that stayed by my side
4444386 you two were at the end of the universe eh right at the edge of knowledge itself and youre busy blogging
4444387 what would stop them from uninstalling deleting steadystate deep freeze or any other restoring software you install
4444388 the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle then ill be closer to 100 percent
4444389 if im not 100 ill probably be 95 96 which ill definitely take
4444390 just trying to pretty much gauge where im at and go out and pretty much do the same that i did the other day
4444391 i can get out there and run around and do some things that i want to do
4444392 its basically just soreness its not what i had last year im excited about turning the corner and getting healthy the healthier i am the more explosive im going to be
4444393 its not a cure and its by no means a guarantee
4444394 but its not going to hurt him other than the discomfort that goes away in about two weeks at this point theyll probably want to try anything to keep him healthy
4444395 theyve been telling me for a while to try them out
4444396 ive just been running naturally for so long i didnt want to try them but being what i went through last year i thought it would be a good time to try them out
4444397 my feet are not in the same position theyve been in for the first 30 years of my life
4444398 its kind of putting them in a new position and theyre not comfortable with it theyre getting sore its just about me getting used to them
4444399 you have to be a petrol head to work here
4444400 whilst we want to save the planet if its not profitable its not going to be sustainable
4444401 i see the opportunity within the uk to leapfrog the first generation and go directly to the second generation making ethanol from biomass
4444402 the market is gigantic because of the legislative agenda in the us
4444403 whether or not that gives them something unique probably not there are other people out there with similar types of microbe but tmo probably has more of an advanced position in terms of demonstration scale up
4444404 you have pled guilty to a serious offence of assault to injury with intent to rob
4444405 the public and particularly householders are entitled to be protected from violent and antisocial behaviour
4444406 he thought nothing of this until a short time later he observed four males wearing balaclavas and dark clothing running across his garden and approaching his conservatory door
4444407 they were carrying various weapons an axe a large knife a bat a bar and a pole they approached the conservatory and began to kick it and hit it
4444408 nel nostro nuovo album abbiamo intenzione di registrare una cover di un grandioso brano dei rush yyz
4444409 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal
4444410 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4444411 any implication otherwise is an absolute lie balthazars affair has been utterly devastating to rosetta and her family
4444412 yes theyre living separate lives at the moment because of his shenanigans
4444413 its disappointing that getty and miller are flaunting this so publicly there are four children involved their oldest cassius is mature enough to understand somethings not right
4444414 the only thing ill say is that i received two different letters i turned them over to the league authorities as was recommended and its in their hands
4444415 thats all i can tell you whoever leaked this information and put it out there did not inform me that this was going to take place
4444416 she looks like the kind of woman that would hit her husband with a shoe for talking back
4444417 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4444418 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4444419 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4444420 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4444421 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4444422 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4444423 she had a cheeky smile which lives with us still and we will cherish the things she did and said for a very long time
4444424 joanne only ever wanted to be friends with everyone and could not see why you had to choose one group of friends instead of another
4444425 i felt so good after that series then outta nowhere bam its like they hit me with a truck
4444426 this doesnt have to be season ending i know a little something that can get me back out there playing in no time
4444427 weve grown a lot ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4444428 kevin has a wonderful heart i dont agree with giving him more money he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4444429 she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4444430 deer drive is an entirely different animal when it comes to hunting games
4444431 most hunting games are slow moving simulations with frustrating controls deer drive is all about shooting all about pick up and play fun and being a more accurate marksman and better hunter than your friends
4444432 clinicians should discuss the possibility of infection and offer treatment to patients who have not been previously treated
4444433 remember your roots what got you to where you are
4444434 it doesnt increase taxes thats whats made clear in this
4444435 its a net tax cut and its paid for by a net spending cut
4444436 w ere at a very fragile state in this economy
4444437 if indeed as cnbc contributor dennis kneale suggests were at an inflection point at either the economy or the stock market this is the worst time to raise taxes you want to improve the economy cut spending dont raise taxes
4444438 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
4444439 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4444440 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4444441 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4444442 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
4444443 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4444444 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4444445 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
4444446 middle ear nerve damage may play a role in affecting taste in children with recurrent ear infections or chronic ear disease who get drainage tubes this damage may increase intake of fattening foods
4444447 there was a trend but not significant for recurrent ear infection to lead to overweight
4444448 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4444449 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4444450 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4444451 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4444452 a tonsillectomy may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4444453 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4444454 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4444455 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues
4444456 the psyche is probably better going into matches now the attitude is better
4444457 people realise that the years are slipping by and their chances are slipping by
4444458 we were lucky enough to get over antrim offaly and wexford it puts us into an all ireland semi final against tipp as underdogs
4444459 we took him down to the community shield last sunday and he did some work for us then
4444460 there are clubs out there that are trying to unsettle my players and its not something im happy about
4444461 but the likes of roque steve warnock theyre all staying i dont sell my best players unless i want to sell them and roque and steven warnock are two players that i definitely dont want to sell and wont be sold
4444462 theyre staying as far as im concerned thats the end of the story
4444463 robbies done well his last game was in october so its a long long time but hes trained ever so well
4444464 hes getting his sharpness back and some of the things hes done in the last three or four days in training are absolutely mind blowing
4444465 hes still got it and he could be a very good asset for us if we decide to take him on
4444466 the olympics has become a really significant cultural event that the country is sharing
4444467 who im kidding its a win win situation theres no question hes the dominant story and a great driver of olympics interest but were finding people might come to see michael phelps but they stay to see lots of other olympics content
4444468 what its confirming essentially is the strength of network television
4444469 james is still working on his fitness and on things he can improve
4444470 fitness isnt an issue because he lives his life right but he can put in more deliveries in the final third
4444471 can he score more goals the answer is yes his finish for our winner against psv was good it was an excellent goal
4444472 prescott looks dangerous but hes just the kind of opponent i need at this stage of my career to get my fear instinct to kick in
4444473 he may have been knocking them out left right and centre but im going to make him wake up and smell the coffee
4444474 ive been working on my defensive skills with new coach jorge rubio and it looks like prescott will be testing out what ive been learning in the gym
4444475 along with my strength and conditioning coach im also punching harder than ever before and i think my offensive skills are going to win my this fight
4444476 i love to entertain the crowd and i plan to go to war against prescott
4444477 i wont be hiding from him ill go after him and try and knock him out like i do with all my opponents
4444478 i think certainly theyre fitter for a start thats probably the thing id see most of all
4444479 i think theyre in better physical shape than they have been in a while
4444480 i think theres a good few new and younger players coming into the set up
4444481 its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4444482 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands
4444483 you cant do it for them you can draw on your own experiences and tell them what it will be like and you can try to recreate situations at training we trust these boys that they will put it all out on the park this saturday
4444484 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4444485 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4444486 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones whether thats slipped a bit i cant answer that i dont know
4444487 lo que dijo es una bestialidad uno puede gritar m s o menos ser m s o menos simp tico pero no acepto de ninguna manera comparar al verdugo de seis millones de personas con un hombre de la democracia
4444488 esos son ejemplos para sacar ventaja politiquera que no tendr an que utilizarse

4444492 for it has been granted to you on behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for him
4444493 most men are hardwired to compete for supremacy in the workplace women are not most want a balanced life of work family friends and community because their biology has evolved that way
4444494 she is also irritated by finding herself in the midst of a controversy about gender difference that wasnt her goal
4444495 everyone in a complex system has a slightly different interpretation the more interpretations we gather the easier it becomes to gain a sense of the whole
4444496 athletes are continually in a dialogue or negotiation with themselves assessing how fatigued they feel
4444497 adept runners are faster due to their underlying physiological capacity rather than because they put more relative effort into their competition
4444498 when you prepare and go out and run a 10 k the person who wins is probably not running harder
4444499 to me what they are saying is there is a protective system built in that doesnt allow us to overuse our muscles
4444500 when you do something repetitive the body knows how to prevent injury
4444501 is a learned pattern of behavior and the muscles get regulated subconsciously by the brain
4444502 it gives us hope we arent going to kill ourselves
4444503 the new pearl harbor disturbing questions about the bush administration and 9 11
4444504 our trial was not powered on a difference in clinical outcome between the two groups however we noted a better clinical outcome in the tirofiban group than in the placebo group with lower overall mortality and less urgent repeat primary coronary angioplasty
4444505 reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the need for fast and strong platelet inhibition it reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical until now only well organized hospital systems have been able to provide such a service
4444506 these data should not lead to guideline modifications combined with previous studies this study supports the notion that use of single agents to block the renin angiotensin system is well tolerated
4444507 the project was among hundreds of repair jobs subsidized in recent years by a 30 million fund established to rid the district of dangerous dilapidated properties
4444508 as tenants across the city complain of squalid conditions the dcra is struggling to account for the millions it has spent
4444509 records show the agency has repeatedly directed jobs to small home improvement contractors without business licenses in some cases for costly projects at empty buildings years later haphazard oversight and record keeping at the dcra make it difficult to track what projects were ordered whether the city paid a fair price or how much work was done
4444510 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4444511 she must know shes a fugitive in at least one state
4444512 one of the major problems we have in clinical trials for new melanoma therapies is that we cant identify the people who are going to have a slower disease progression no matter what they receive in a clinical trial
4444513 when new treatments are tested it is necessary to show clinical benefit by comparing patients who receive the new therapy with those who do not although patients might all have the same type of cancers there can be big differences in their survival simply because their cancers behave differently and this may have nothing to do with the treatment if we are able to identify the good players and the bad players up front it becomes a whole lot easier figuring out whether good results are due to the new treatment or not most importantly far fewer patients would be needed for the clinical trials its partly because we cant clinically identify subtypes of patients that we have to do very large and very expensive trials and of course this increases the time it takes to test the clinical benefit of potential new therapies
4444514 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4444515 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4444516 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4444517 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4444518 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4444519 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects
4444520 the torch study brings some clarity to the treatment picture and provides some hopeful signs for patients with copd
4444521 this study also demonstrates that no treatment placebo is not an option for patients with moderate to severe copd
4444522 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
4444523 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
4444524 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4444525 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4444526 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4444527 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements
4444528 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4444529 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4444530 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4444531 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4444532 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
4444533 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
4444534 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
4444535 if you were more discerning you d probably buy this book if you do read this book you will be this book on discernment is simple clear well written and well illustrated
4444536 to keep the excitement over phelps and company on the u
4444537 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4444538 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4444539 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4444540 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4444541 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4444542 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4444543 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4444544 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there

4444548 there are more than 35 000 visits each year in the u s to emergency departments for injuries from nail guns
4444549 over the past three years we have consistently found the sequential trigger twice as safe as the more commonly used contact trip trigger
4444550 the contact trip trigger allows workers to rapidly fire the tool and more frequently results in injuries from accidental discharges double fires and ricocheting nails
4444551 we found that carpenters with more training were better equipped to handle the tool and less prone to injury carpenters were best protected when they received both classroom training and hands on instruction unfortunately most residential carpenters including immigrant workers are less likely to get training compared to the union workers we studied
4444552 there are currently no regulations that require the sequential trigger be used or that define minimal training requirements even though data suggests there should be
4444553 last week saw three human rights episodes play out in russia china and the united states these events show us how america stacks up against the rest of the world this past week the world saw the resurgent danger of the old soviet union in the modern russian federation russian military forces invaded the sovereign neighboring nation of georgia although russia claims to be aiding people in the disputed georgian province of south ossetia the reality is that covert russian agents have been fomenting upheaval and russia had been moving forces into place for this invasion prime minister vladimir putin is taking russia back to an autocratic government political opponents are being jailed critics silenced strategic assets seized the bear has returned putin is also using this to send a message his message to europe is that the russian bear will maul any who oppose it
4444554 well im not the one who put myself in there
4444555 ia adalah termasuk teman setan atau mungkin termasuk golongan pendeta nasrani karena sunnah kami adalah menikah orang yang paling buruk diantara kamu adalah mereka yang membujang orang mati yang paling hina di antara kamu adalah orang yang membujang

4444561 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4444562 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4444563 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4444564 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4444565 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4444566 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4444567 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous uvb induced priming for skin cancer by practicing good sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4444568 these moisturizing creams might act as an irritant or a promoter of skin cancer in mice skin but extensive study is needed before we advise people that their commonly used moisturizers can cause skin cancer
4444569 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not
4444570 non pharmacological methods such as exercising are important in improving blood pressure control on a population level as this study looked at the cross section of the u s population
4444571 that would result in an annual reduction of stroke coronary heart disease and all cause mortality by 6 percent 4 percent and 3 percent respectively
4444572 it is thus appropriate to recommend exercise as most patients will follow their physician recommendations and this is associated with improved blood pressure control and likely a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled blood pressure
4444573 despite clinical trial evidence and national guideline recommendations for exercise counseling to be provided for patients with high blood pressure this study demonstrates that only one third of these eligible patients received exercise counseling
4444574 much more needs to be done to ensure that patients with high blood pressure receive appropriate counseling on lifestyle change including counseling on the importance of regular aerobic exercise from their physicians
4444575 they could have died within months to a year or two
4444576 they direct traffic recognize when foreign invaders come into the body and they can induce formation of killer cells to go after the invader
4444577 the antibody decorates tumor cells so any passing t cell touching that cell briefly will adhere to it much longer than normal and then the whole program of cell killing is kicked off
4444578 i think its exciting that we have new tools to treat cancer
4444579 whenever you have specificity to act against the cancer cell and also solicit host systems to combat the cancer i think thats an advance
4444580 if i give this to a person with a normal immune system will i take out all the b cells
4444581 probably and you have to ask yourself what the significance of that is
4444582 schip and medicaid provide an important safety net for americas families especially for families with chronically ill children these programs allow kids to get the care they need so they can feel better grow stronger and thrive in school
4444583 when children who need care do not receive it their conditions worsen and are harder and more expensive to treat later because of medicaid and schip millions of kids can get regular check ups take the medications they need to stay well and see a doctor when they are sick parents of any uninsured child should find out if their family is eligible for low cost or free insurance before sending their kids back to school
4444584 there is not a lot of data out there on the actual dose response
4444585 stopping is the best thing to do but cutting back will also reduce the risk
4444586 cigarettes among other tobacco products are the only products that when used as directed are still guaranteed to do harm
4444587 smoking disrupts the cells lining the blood vessels it increases blood fibrogen levels which makes blood more likely to clot it increases the stickiness of platelets the cells that form blood clots and it also decreases the bodys natural clot dissolving mechanism
4444588 we see broadly how it applies to all young women
4444589 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4444590 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4444591 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4444592 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected

4444611 barangsiapa beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir janganlah ia bersunyi sepi berduaan dengan wanita yang tidak didampingi mahramnya karena yang menjadi pihak ketiganya adalah syaitan
4444612 sungguh kepala salah seorang diantara kamu ditusuk dengan jarum dari besi lebih baik daripada menyentuh wanita yang tidak halal baginya
4444613 barangsiapa yang menikahkan putrinya karena silau akan kekayaan lelaki meskipun buruk agama dan akhlaknya maka tidak akan pernah pernikahan itu dibarakahi nya siapa yang menikahi seorang wanita karena kedudukannya allah akan menambahkan kehinaan kepadanya siapa yang menikahinya karena kekayaan allah hanya akan memberinya kemiskinan siapa yang menikahi wanita karena bagus nasabnya allah akan menambahkan kerendahan padanya namun siapa yang menikah hanya karena ingin menjaga pandangan dan nafsunya atau karena ingin mempererat kasih sayang allah senantiasa memberi barakah dan menambah kebarakahan itu padanya
4444614 janganlah kamu menikahi wanita karena kecantikannya mungkin saja kecantikan itu membuatmu hina jangan kamu menikahi wanita karena harta tahtanya mungkin saja harta tahtanya membuatmu melampaui batas akan tetapi nikahilah wanita karena agamanya sebab seorang budak wanita yang shaleh meskipun buruk wajahnya adalah lebih utama
4444615 berikanlah mahar mas kawin kepada wanita yang kamu nikahi sebagai pemberian dengan penuh kerelaan
4444616 wanita yang paling agung barakahnya adalah yang paling ringan maharnya

4444618 jangan mempermahal nilai mahar sesungguhnya kalau lelaki itu mulia di dunia dan takwa di sisi allah maka rasulullah sendiri yang akan menjadi wali pernikahannya
4444619 hai orang orang beriman janganlah kamu mengharamkan apa yang dihalalkan oleh allah kepada kamu dan jangan kamu melampaui batas karena allah tidak suka kepada orang orang yang melampaui batas
4444620 ya allah jadikanlah aku ridho terhadap apa apa yang engkau tetapkan dan jadikan barokah apa apa yang telah engkau takdirkan sehingga tidak ingin aku menyegerakan apa apa yang engkau tunda dan menunda apa apa yang engkau segerakan ya allah berilah pahala dalam musibahku kali ini dan gantikan untukku yang lebih baik darinya amiin

4444625 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4444626 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4444627 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4444628 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with age
4444629 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4444630 i do think this is one of the most underreported issues of the past 10 years
4444631 the reality is that in many respects the middle class of this country is collapsing the vast majority of our people have seen a decline in their standard of living
4444632 seven years of flat or declining wages seven years of increasing costs and seven year of mounting debts have placed unprecedented stress on the ordinary families by every critical financial measure these families are losing ground without changes in critical economic policies the strong middle class that has been the backbone of the american economy and the american democracy is in jeopardy
4444633 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4444634 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4444635 the continuing improvement in profitability is attributable to the higher prices which vestas initiated in 2005 and the ongoing enhancement of operational efficiency

4444639 we need the high ambitions of the youth when the imam khomeini made the prophecy of collapse of the soviet union there were those who did not believe him but the prophecy was realized and when there is speech of collapse and dissolution of the world order there probably are those who do not believe this but they will decline and become invisible thanks to divine insight the most important thing is that we choose a goal

4444646 no please finish what you are doing and then ill pay for my stuff
4444647 what who was bitching all i said was that you could finish your shopping and i would wait rather than you hog up the whole conveyor belt
4444648 seeing how quietly this news has been released has surprised us all
4444649 officials have confirmed that a press release will not be issued by either the ministers of canadian heritage or foreign affairs
4444650 that this communications strategy was specifically intended to minimize negative reaction from industry stakeholders
4444651 were surprised by the cancellations because this government has been quite vocal about the importance of canadas role internationally the importance of our exports and being competitive globally it feels counterintuitive and counterproductive
4444652 we were on a teleconference with the canadian conference of the arts and somebody checked their web site and found out that theyd posted this
4444653 apparently thats how most of us are finding out not that anyones contacted us from heritage its just posted on web sites and all of a sudden the programs are gone
4444654 if its not short term electoral strategy what the hell is it
4444655 is it an error in judgment is it a political gamble i dont know but from a purely economic sense and a governance sense we cannot understand unless they have replacement programs
4444656 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4444657 we look forward to working with them as our board continues its ongoing efforts to enhance stockholder value
4444658 do you want to enlarge the font so you can see it clearly
4444659 if the answer is yes please meet me at adrians a chic restaurant in provo utah if the answer is no then please set the timer on the bomb and leave i will be home before it blows up because living without you isnt worth living
4444660 it would be alright if you were to get lost
4444661 the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
4444662 joseph dont blame the principal for once youre supposed to be a manager act like one
4444663 youre not my friend and you never have been my friend because a friend would not treat another friend as badly as you have treated me
4444664 first of all my biggest problem is that i was not told about this until now i should have been told you werent renewing my contract last week when all of the other schools are hiring teachers for the upcoming year but no this school this lazy school that doesnt do anything until the principal orders it waited until the last possible minute to tell me now my options are small i will probably have to commute a long way to work if i can even find a teaching job if you had told me last month as every other school in the area would have i would have had a lot of options
4444665 second in my job before coming to taiwan i was in airline management i had to fire dozens of employees in my time there i never once did it via email and i always gave them a chance to change what they were doing to avoid being fired not once have you or anyone at this school told me that i was doing a bad job in fact i heard many times that i was doing a good job let me tell you something joseph i feel confident that im the best english teacher you have here
4444666 if youre talking about the english program of this school as being your way then i understand it completely i have told you in the past that i think it is the wrong way to teach english because students actually know less english after leaving here than when they came you were okay with me teaching in a different way then if your feelings changed you should have told me
4444667 we just felt that you werent encouraging the students to speak english
4444668 students from class 306 some of them have had a problem with me throughout all their three years at this school you know that they have been encouraged to say those things by their homeroom teacher sharon
4444669 we just felt that you werent encouraging the students to speak english
4444670 how many times did you watch me teach joseph or how many times did sharon or her predecessor carol watch me teach zero thats how many times if you had a problem with me at any time you would think that just one of you would actually see how i teach instead of listening to some under achieving students who are just trying to get on the good side of their homeroom teacher if that wasnt the case with those students and i may be wrong then surely it was because they were upset that i was actually challenging them to learn english no other teacher does here
4444671 we just feel that you werent encouraging the students to speak english
4444672 back when you asked me to conduct some classes outside for the remainder of the semester i did so when you asked me to take the students on a field trip i did so other than that you havent asked me to do anything you dont even know what i teach or how i teach honestly i taught from the assigned textbooks to all students every english major class i taught has completed their textbook how many other english teachers did that im sure you dont know the answer but i do none that is because they have been busy teaching their own things telling their own stories about life or simply not teaching at all
4444673 i am the only one who is actually encouraging the students to speak english
4444674 no other english teacher asks students questions and gets answers orally throughout every class but me i award them extra points not only for answering questions but asking questions too and the way i teach using various audiovisual tools and the internet is to help them get excited about speaking english but you wouldnt know any of that because you or any of your subordinates never took the time to actually watch me teach youd rather just guess that im not doing a good job because the students are not meeting your expectations with their verbal english ability i am not the problem here it is the entire english program that is the problem english needs to be taught as a whole reading writing speaking and listening you shouldnt have the majority of english teachers focusing on teaching vocabulary words and expect the only two foreign teachers you have at the school to teach everything else
4444675 when taiwan is second from the bottom in english proficiency as they are now just one up from the bottom level vietnam your way is not working if you dont change your way taiwan will continue to remain at the bottom dont you think that is sad for a country with this much potential
4444676 it might not be the right way as you say it
4444677 but it is our way and you should understand that
4444678 and i understand that if the president of a company wants something done a certain way like youre saying the principal wants english speaking taught and then the employees of that company should do it or leave the company i understand that and i have always been willing to do what the principal wants but you never told me what he wants i dont even think he knows what he wants do you know what he wants
4444679 youre the english teacher im not by now you should know our way
4444680 well i start with the basics and go from there but my students are a lot lower level than your students
4444681 i try to tell them how learning international business will help them in the future
4444682 thats exactly what i do i first try and get the students interested in learning english by helping them understand how it can help their future then i begin with the basics so i am doing it your way
4444683 next year at the end of my contract im not going to do it anymore its just too much for me
4444684 but i dont think youll do it you love the money too much
4444685 i dont care about the money the principal is just putting too many demands on me do you know that i didnt leave here until 7 30p every night last week every night and nobody cares
4444686 i know exactly how you feel when i was doing that student video for more than a year i put in numerous extra hours and worked several saturdays without extra pay nobody cared about that in fact this is what happened to me because of my extra efforts im getting fired i never thought id get fired for doing a good job
4444687 voy a hablar ahora con el presidente georgiano saakashvili acerca de las aclaraciones que han brindado los franceses

4444693 the preference canadians are showing for conservatives on most issues is really a reflection of the greater trust they have in harper as a leader right now conservatives are very solid in a whole bunch of areas and thats almost a surrogate for leadership thats why it really will come down to the campaign

4444702 we would like you to read a couple of paragraphs on the following page after reading these paragraphs you will be asked to make a judgment about the main character
4444703 the assumption is that english carries with it knowledge about american or anglo saxon culture and so evokes individualism whereas other non western languages carry with them knowledge about a home culture assumed to be more collectivist
4444704 thung phramen and oval public area surrounded by 365 tamarind trees
4444705 not sufficient admissible evidence to support a conviction proving the identity of the driver beyond a reasonable doubt
4444706 its the highest burden in the law proving beyond a reasonable doubt we can only base our decision on admissible evidence
4444707 we just didnt have sufficient admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt criminal liability
4444708 and the law is clear that you have to have corroboration of accomplice testimony
4444709 we didnt have that were ethically barred from filing a case unless we have sufficient corroborating evidence
4444710 i dont see how the d a can convict me of racing when it takes two to tango
4444711 how can i get convicted of racing and they get let go free the same witnesses said i was racing and they were racing whered they go
4444712 its a huge letdown that this wont be going to trial

4444717 shes become an adjective friends will go shopping with each other and say its so madonna thats what you want in fashion
4444718 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4444719 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4444720 that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4444721 the gop ate new orleans and i was hungry again an hour later
4444722 theres a lot of cars but they dont make a peep
4444723 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4444724 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4444725 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4444726 im old enough to remember when they called people retarded were not retarded were mentally disabled
4444727 maybe it will help the mainstream realize that people with disabilities are simply people first and that they should be treated with the same sensitivity all people want to be treated with
4444728 hes rehabbing regaining the range of motion doing what theyre asking him to do

4444732 will the site make it still cant tell the bar is set high for the inquisitr mostly due to the investment in a writing staff standalone without any paid staff it would certainly put some food on my table now but on the same token could i have grown it that far without the support of our writing team i would be lying to say were out of the woods yet but the trends are positive and if it does fail well go down fighting alone considering technorati rank traffic and even revenue its a minimum 20 30k sale on sitepoint but possibly pushing 50k or higher theres great value there and hopefully it will start paying for itself soon
4444733 in my regular life i have a little brother who looks up to me so i just try to behave for him
4444734 the biggest thing ive learned is that everything that seemed so important when you were younger just goes out the window what other people think of you you just dont care anymore when you get a bit older you become more comfortable with yourself
4444735 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
4444736 the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth
4444737 circumnavigation is a case of traveling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
4444738 given these trends risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside
4444739 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4444740 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
4444741 why yes brad and i are having a little spat oh look at the superior detailing and textures on my sheets arent they a beautiful example of fine craftsmanship and meticulous construction i think the unique embroidery techniques on each piece results in a layered elegant look dont you there is no doubt that he is having an on set affair with that little tramp

4444745 this reveals his unsuitability to hold office we cannot afford to wait until the next elections we must seek a change in direction right now
4444746 she used to say she was angry with her family and was going to run away but i mean every teenager says that nobody took it seriously shes a nice girl from a good family
4444747 the whole thing was set up with military precision its really scary
4444748 im leaving i want to live my own life and not live by your rules anymore
4444749 she has never even slept away from our home before
4444750 there are no words to describe to you how we feel
4444751 all we want is to know our daughter is safe and for her to contact us and tell us she is okay because for all we know right now someone has manipulated her and anything could happen to her
4444752 consideration should be given to whether it is necessary to have some inclusive electoral system made up of both constituency and proportional list mps
4444753 rasmussen is the most handsome prime minister in europe i think i will introduce him to my wife because he is even more handsome than cacciari
4444754 we see all sorts of people the thing that links them is that they have no money worries accountants doctors even footballers and politicians
4444755 cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life i never found any occupation more important
4444756 i love my husband that is why i want to swap him
4444757 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4444758 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
4444759 we will be seeking a meeting with hbos to discuss their plans and to see what assistance support and advice we can offer to local employees
4444760 we are hopeful the workers affected will redeploy or take voluntary redundancy
4444761 always use the selected program to open this kind of file
4444762 its something that weve wanted to do we are very very excited
4444763 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
4444764 its unfortunate because we do feel like we beat ourselves more than anything in that big inning
4444765 they got some hits at the end there but it got a little bit out of hand due to ourselves and were really confident in our defence and thats something thats not a norm for canada
4444766 its about a 30 minute trip back to the village and i think its going to be a pretty quiet one
4444767 but the main focus is washing this off and getting ready for tomorrow
4444768 when we started the game we had the top of the order lefty lefty lefty lefty righty lefty so its really about putting us in the best position and lauren was going to do that
4444769 she had pitched all morning so we were only really asking her to do that
4444770 anoche de forma inmediata murieron dos personas y luego murieron en el trascurso de la noche varias de las personas que hab an sido trasladadas al hospital en la ciudad de medell n
4444771 hay todo tipo de heridos y los que fueron trasladados est n graves y otros con menor gravedad son atendidos en ituango
4444772 es un sitio donde concurre mucha gente y seg n me han comentado que pod a haber m s de 500 o 700 personas y con ese saldo tan tr gico podemos pensar que puede llegar a aumentar el n mero de muertos
4444773 es una reacci n de la subversi n contra la poblaci n civil porque fueron ellos los que sufrieron este atentado no fue la polic a ni el ej rcito el que sufri las consecuencias
4444774 i know im digging a hole for myself with the raptors and everything because the expectations are going to be there
4444775 i can play defence and i can play a different role i think thats hard for guys to accept sometimes but i just want to win
4444776 in 06 i was still trying to find out what that role was i was still trying to find myself and everything
4444777 it was frustrating because i wasnt playing well and if i wasnt doing what i was supposed to be doing i couldnt play
4444778 i think this time i kind of figured it out i kind of just let the game come to me and to be honest its a lot easier as long as i exert all my energy on defence run the floor and set screens ill play
4444779 he always seems to find himself in the right place at the right time and when we penetrate hes able to find a little crack or seam and be able to finish
4444780 and defensively he did a great job on the pick and roll and stopping their guards from penetrating he was getting steals and we converted them into easy points he did a fantastic job
4444781 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4444782 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4444783 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4444784 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4444785 act on what you know and allah will bestow upon you what you do not know
4444786 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4444787 el futuro es incierto pero esa incertidumbre est en el coraz n mismo de la creatividad humana
4444788 through the lords mercies we are not consumed because his compassions are new every morning great is your faithfulness lord
4444789 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents
4444790 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of the scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4444791 will be ruling supreme this winter as the tween hit god save us all
4444792 to think that someone in public office is running these companies and is perhaps making a lot of money and the service of these companies is so terrible and the homeowners hands are tied
4444793 no estamos de acuerdo con la caza de brujas que est organizando el alcalde contra todos los j venes socialistas y a las que se ha unido el presidente de nngg juan parejo en una actitud irresponsable para un cargo pol tico como el que sustenta
4444794 a los datos me remito prosigue ferreira alonso cuando 6 j venes que no piensan igual que el alcalde tienen que pasar por el juzgado ya que el sr m ndez los ha se alado como sospechosos simplemente por ser j venes socialistas y sin tener una prueba fehaciente
4444795 parejo nos quiere vender la piel del oso antes de cazarlo y si tiene una prueba de que el concejal socialista y secretario general de las js de calera de le n francisco jos gata bejarano es el culpable de las pintadas contra el alcalde que vaya y lo denuncie el sr parejo vive en una nube en esta pa s hasta que se demuestre lo contrario hay que demostrar que una persona es culpable d nde queda la presunci n de inocencia le preguntamos al sr parejo o es que se quiere saltar la ley
4444796 que hacia este se or en la v a p blica tumbado en el c sped en un parque a altas horas de la madrugada acompa ado por ni as menores de edad me imagino que le estar a contando un cuento a lo mejor
4444797 tira la piedra y esconde la mano dejando a las pies de los caballos a nuestro compa ero esto si es una prueba fehaciente
4444798 given these trends risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside
4444799 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4444800 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
4444801 je me fous de cette m daille je voulais lor
4444802 there appears to be a shift in the willingness of firms to raise prices
4444803 costs are rising so rapidly that many businesses have no choice but to pass along price increases
4444804 with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks
4444805 inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term
4444806 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4444807 great place to go out with a small group or take a date
4444808 no way she was born in ohio too we have so much in common
4444809 you call this history where are the salacious details about origen

4444811 passados que s o cem dias continua em aberto a quest o de se o duo medvedev putin uma constru o tempor ria ou um modelo a longo prazo de organiza o do poder supremo no pa s
4444812 fazendo uma analogia com os jogos ol mpicos pode se dizer que dmitri medvedev come ou a correr no cargo de presidente do pa s e at ao dia 14 de agosto
4444813 muito importante que tenha passado a prova a sua uni o com putin porque frequentemente essas alian as desmoronam se em situa es de crise
4444814 medvedev pela primeira vez passou para primeiro plano empurrando para tr s o primeiro ministro putin
4444815 raramente se encontra um presidente que durante os primeiros cem dias tenha sa do vencedor numa situa o militar muito s ria
4444816 durante o conflito georgiano ossete putin demonstrou precisamente que ele desempenha um papel fulcral
4444817 medvedev actua no campo internacional enquanto putin est presente no campo interno
4444818 logo que come ou a crise na oss tia do sul a discuss o conjunta de quest es e a tomada de decis es foram rapidamente estabelecidas
4444819 resta saber quando ir come ar a realiza o pr tica da estrat gia do desenvolvimento do pa s a longo prazo porque essa foi precisamente a base da nova configura o do poder o duo medvedev e putin
4444820 the outlook for the economy has worsened in recent months and the downside risks to growth have increased
4444821 to date the largest economic effects of the financial turmoil appear to have been on the housing market which as you know has deteriorated significantly over the past two years or so
4444822 it would be less but i do believe well keep growing
4444823 show lower projections of growth growth looks to be weak but still positive
4444824 if we are going to get back on our feet again
4444825 followed by a somewhat stronger pace of growth starting later this year
4444826 important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain including the possibilities that the housing market or the labor market may deteriorate to an extent beyond that currently anticipated
4444827 a critical task for the federal reserve over the course of this year will be to assess whether the stance of monetary policy is properly calibrated to foster our mandated objectives
4444828 we count on those at the top to sound an alarm
4444829 what we got was a snooze button weve been behind the curve
4444830 its one thing to identify a problem its another thing to know exactly what to do about it

4444839 if obama wins he will win by a landslide margin if mccain wins it will be a very small margin
4444840 dieses verfahren ist kein verfahren wie jedes andere gewesen auch f r uns nicht
4444841 es treibt uns um dass hier in diesem lande ein kind verdurstet und verhungert
4444842 es gab eine tiefgreifende entfremdung zwischen ulrike und dem kind
4444843 beide rechneten sp testens nach einem besuch bei den gro eltern weihnachten 2007 mit dem tod des kindes
4444844 its actually eight but theres three tracks for each one so it sounds like 24

4444846 no because we want it to sound more like a gang than a choir
4444847 there shall be no interference whatsoever by sacred religious feelings in state affairs and politics
4444848 it is not possible to prevent being listened to the only way is not to talk on the phone if there is nothing illegal in our actions we should not be concerned about such things
4444849 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
4444850 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
4444851 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
4444852 promover el desarrollo local y regional favorecer la radicaci n de inversiones la generaci n de riqueza y la creaci n de fuentes laborales en las distintas localidades del partido de general villegas

4444855 ante la falta concreta de una iniciativa del gobierno nacional presentamos una serie de medidas para el campo frente a la crisis con el campo nuestra obligaci n como oposici n es elaborar y discutir propuestas para alcanzar una soluci n distinta y superadora de los planes que intenta imponer el gobierno nacional
4444856 5 things to live by and guaranteed if you did your life would be successful
4444857 do the right thing for the right reasons i attempt to live by this and although i am not always successful i make the good effort
4444858 el gran presupuesto que tiene el partido debe gastarse en lo que la gente necesita no donde la pol tica elige
4444859 somos la oposici n real en general villegas y lo demostramos en el concejo deliberante estamos convencidos que el a o que viene vamos a hacer una elecci n mucho mejor que la campa a pasada que fue muy buena pero la vamos a mejorar
4444860 general villegas tiene una particularidad es el lugar donde el pro realiz la mejor elecci n en toda la provincia de buenos aires
4444861 se construy un equipo que logr r pidamente interpretar los valores del partido que no es m s que recuperar la pol tica al servicio de la gente
4444862 nuestra postura es muy clara y de profundo compromiso con el campo pero entendemos que este conflicto no debe ser aprovechado o manipulado por ning n espacio pol tico
4444863 tiene una oportunidad espectacular que no se da desde los a os 30 de convertirse en una potencia el mundo quiere comprar lo que tenemos para ofrecer y est dispuesto a pagarlo caro pero la falta de inteligencia y capacidad para llevar los hilos del pa s han transformado esta buena noticia en una desgracia estamos convencidos que sin el campo no hay pa s real posible
4444864 la planta de tratamientos cloacales las calles en malas condiciones las cloacas que se rompen en pleno centro los barrios que no tienen infraestructura
4444865 este es un a o para estar cerca de la gente hay que caminar escuchar y hacer crecer este espacio porque estoy seguro que un d a va a estar bueno villegas gobernado por gente del pro
4444866 el campo est defendiendo la vida en los pueblos del interior
4444867 me encontr con un grupo muy conciente de la legitimidad que tiene el reclamo de la vocaci n que tienen para que las medidas que tom el gobierno se corrijan pero tambi n tremendamente comprometidos con intentar buscar una soluci n de pacificaci n en funci n de eso creen que lo mejor es poner la otra mejilla una vez m s intentar levantar el paro para despu s dialogar es una postura entendible que no se si tendr xito pero es un intento m s que en el pro valoramos como cada instancia de apertura de di logo ojal la pol tica no mal utilice la buena intenci n que sin bajar las banderas del reclamo intenta pacificar el pa s
4444868 este partido genera much simo m s de lo que recibe se van m s de 120 millones de d lares con las medidas anteriores adem s deber an sumarse unos 30 millones con las retenciones m viles y tiene un presupuesto de 70 millones de pesos con lo que queda claro que a este distrito le quitan recursos
4444869 inaceptable que con el tama o que tiene la ciudad tenga el basural que tiene se podr a instalar una planta de reciclado de residuos para que la gente que cirujea viva de su trabajo dignamente de esta manera el 70 de los desperdicios ser an reutilizados en otra cosa y lo que queda s debe colocarse en un relleno sanitario bien hecho donde se traten los l quidos lixiviados nos preocupa tambi n la ubicaci n del futuro parque industrial los que gobiernan deben comprender que a esa zona dentro de 10 a os ya se la devor la ciudad y no pueden convivir las f bricas con los vecinos porque despu s vienen los problemas
4444870 la justicia que se torn sumamente garantista tiene que ponerse a la altura del reclamo de la gente aunque es un problema que se repite en toda la provincia de buenos aires hemos presentado varios proyectos al respecto pero todo viene demasiado lento comparado con el avance de la inseguridad
4444871 en los ltimos dos a os el club recibi subsidios y ayuda econ mica por valores cercanos a quinientos mil pesos 500 000 atraviesa una situaci n institucional irregular y se le est dando mucho dinero de los contribuyentes
4444872 hay que establecer prioridades porque tenemos el tema de la salud sabemos que el centro de salud donde deben atenderse los vecinos de villa sauze es muy pobre y no tiene infraestructura
4444873 y si le sumamos que la provincia de la pampa impuso restricciones para atender en sus hospitales a vecinos de otra provincia y que para atenderse en el hospital municipal deben usar el camino a villegas de tierra que se vuelve intransitable los d as de lluvia deber amos pensar en atender tambi n la necesidad de salud que tiene los vecinos de villa sauze
4444874 apoyamos el aumento dado pero nos parece poco ya que seg n estimaciones oficiales y privadas la canasta b sica ronda los 1
4444875 teniendo en cuenta la inflaci n los recursos del presupuesto el aumento que se avecina en las tasas que cobra el municipio y sobre todo considerando que los trabajadores contribuyen con su labor a generar ingresos instamos al ejecutivo para que a la brevedad proceda a recomponer los salarios de los empleados municipales
4444876 si esto se ocult qu puede pasar con temas m s graves referidos a la gesti n del intendente o sus funcionarios no podemos ser c mplices de este ocultamiento

4445072 ive done two remixes for the new primal scream single uptown one of which is now on my page have a listen see what you think
4445073 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
4445074 i was mentioned in the statement to suggest ive given the project my seal of approval
4445075 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
4445076 i heard woody is saying that everything that was said in spanish was improvised and thats not true
4445077 most of it was translated literally from the english that he wrote so when you are working in your mother tongue you put that word and you take that other word because you know its going to help the line to be more understood

4445079 i count myself as one highly blessed of the lord to be able to remain at least within my continent and receive such high quality education i have had the honor of sitting under dr minnick dr horn dr muri dr patterson dr straub and now dr hankins what impresses me most is not their titles which are important or even their reputation stateside but what god has done in my life through their ministry of teaching my view of the holy scriptures has been profoundly elevated along with my appreciation for its depth and the level of diligence called for in my dealings with it which is what you my lecturers are equipping me with i walk away from the recent class with such a grand view of my calling and the charge call to be the man of god out of the pulpit so as to enable me to preach in the first person i am truly grateful to all who are sacrificing to expose me to these men and all who are enabling my lecturers to stay here and serve me these men have been used by god to help transform me it is for them that i am most thankful i type this letter from the building that supporters have helped build we often thank god for these faceless saints my prayer is that god will complete the work that he is doing through them by making me a fruitful man of god back home and allow me to enjoy this eternal fruit with them

4445085 but a half way house between flesh eating and a truly humane civilised diet
4445086 as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems at every scale from local to global
4445087 one personal act that can have a profound impact on these environmental issues is reducing meat consumption considering the tonnage americans consume even modest reductions in meat consumption would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources

4445101 fifteen of the 30 students were seriously injured and admitted to a local hospital
4445102 many terrorist groups have become active in india as well as abroad but we should strengthen our views against terrorism to get rid of this fear psychosis
4445103 if we have to progress and bring reforms in our economy we need to build up a front against terrorism
4445104 the security arrangements have been stepped up and we are carrying out random checking at major installations like railway station bus terminals hotels and all other public places these activities are on since past two days across the state
4445105 we were going to contai town to perform in a cultural programme on the occasion of independence day the bus overturned near deulti in kolkatas twin district howrah quite a few members of our theatre group bohurupee were injured in the accident and shifted to uluberia state general hospital by the locals
4445106 would not tolerate any attacks on the legitimacy of their unions from the government or anyone else
4445107 it seems that the government is now waging a dirty fight since it is decapitating the workers movement and huanuni which has been the vanguard of trade union struggles for this reason we must not play the governments game
4445108 i empathise with the comrades who are shocked by the deaths in caihausi this was the governments fault but we cannot turn in on ourselves and our leaders since this is exactly what the government wants to divide the workers movement and to rule over it
4445109 these positions in huanuni will be filled so that this great union is not undermined and so that there is no crisis in the unions and the people in the leadership of the sindicato de los mineros de huanuni will be able to lead the workers struggle in the interests of the workers movement
4445110 there is a sweet spot between complete order and complete disorder what you have to remember is that there is a cost to order if you stop to tidy up every time something becomes disordered youll continually interrupt yourself and never get any work done but on the other hand if youre a complete mess youll never find anything
4445111 people with a moderate amount of mess usually have everything to hand
4445112 candidates who went on the show raised about 44 percent more money than like candidates who didnt in the 30 days after the show
4445113 can i trust joseph shereshevsky i am planning to invest a lot of money with him
4445114 when the evidence comes out it is going to be clear that mr shereshevsky did not intentionally commit a crime
4445115 i dont make much money so i worked nights for six years to raise extra money
4445116 now i have to sell my dream house or lose it because i cant afford the payments
4445117 he pays peoples mortgages pays to keep loved ones in a nursing home
4445118 people trust him and you do business with people you trust
4445119 when he began to mingle with the jewish community of norfolk
4445120 we are in debt and i am working diligently to get us out of it
4445121 for us to get to the final we feel like we have already done really well
4445122 i feel very honoured ive been in singapore for just over two years and can help it get an olympic medal at least a silver for the first time in 48 years
4445123 we were doing a lot of work for not a lot of money and if we said anything we got fired immediately
4445124 if the votes of illegal workers are counted in union elections unions may have an incentive to encourage illegal aliens to conceal their undocumented status
4445125 every day that goes by is one day less that they have to negotiate
4445126 you are employing and taking advantage of the workers vulnerable status and then when they try to assert their rights then you use that immigration status that allowed you to exploit them to prevent them from using the courts and fighting for their rights
4445127 but for the most part international is a decent place to work the workers have been there for years it doesnt have to be like it is at agri
4445128 the supreme court petition speaks for itself as to anything else youll have to rely on the record in the case
4445129 nobody wants to lose their job and if they talk about it they are definitely going to lose their job
4445130 we cannot work any longer for 55 hours a week at straight time with no benefits and abusive treatment by our boss
4445131 i heard that whoever would sign the papers would get fired thats when i moved to get another job
4445132 if a union organizer keeps bothering you just say no
4445133 the owner is mad that the workers have chosen to be represented by a real union instead of the fake union the owner picked out and believes he can control
4445134 i decided to go on strike because i wanted a contract with more time for lunch overtime pay and proper clothing for working in the freezer
4445135 discovered that of the 21 workers who voted in the election the social security numbers of only four matched social security records with the same name
4445136 it just kind of makes sense logically that if you cant work for this employer you shouldnt be a member of the bargaining unit for this employer
4445137 here respondent is grasping at anything to deny employees the right to representation
4445138 respondent came up with this defense after it tried everything else and the union was certified
4445139 remarkably agri processors brief neither acknowledges this controlling language in sure tan nor even quotes the nlras definition of employee
4445140 the court should reconsider the central legal issue and interpret the national labor relations act in light of todays laws and todays public policies
4445141 they knew that they had illegals and that was their chance
4445142 they could have cleaned up postville too but they didnt
4445143 es w rde mich nicht wundern wenn im nachhinein noch unerlaubte mittel entdeckt w rden

4445149 vielleicht w re es f r ihn mal gut wenn er ein rennen verliert um zu zeigen dass er kein bermensch ist
4445150 wenn ich die zeiten sehe werde ich skeptisch da frage ich mich schon wie ist das m glich ohne unterst tzende mittel

4445158 he pasado toda la noche en gori la ciudad es patrullada por las fuerzas de ocupaci n rusas la situaci n es de calma
4445159 los rusos prometieron que hoy permitir n el paso de ayuda humanitaria

4445162 the competition is different i am very competitive and get a buzz out of finding new ways of challenging my mind
4445163 it started when a teacher at school taught us a rhyme to remember i read a few books on memory and started competing this year
4445164 el bar a nos ha despertado de una manera muy brusca de todos nuestros sue os
4445165 extensive aerial surveys for moose and caribou were conducted on the entire northern peninsula during the 2007 08 winter season
4445166 throughout the survey period wildlife officials did not observe any indication of a widespread disease
4445167 however we are continuing our efforts to collect and examine any animal reported to be in poor physical condition as the health of our wildlife populations is critical to our management of these species
4445168 we ask people in the area to work with us to monitor the health of the local moose population as well as any other animals in the area that may be exhibiting signs of illness
4445169 african countries are not using alternative power supplies since international combines do not encourage the switch indeed the use of such technologies may damage their business
4445170 im going now to talk to georgian president mikhail saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4445171 and then well try to get this formal cease fire in place because the goal of this is to get a cease fire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4445172 so if you want to see what facebook looked like about three years ago you can go there at the time it literally was just facebook copied in red
4445173 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action their strategy appears to be if you cant beat them sue them
4445174 the first difficulty they run into is studivz is in germany
4445175 so facebook has sued them here on the theory that by logging in to the facebook site they agreed to be subject to suit in california
4445176 because it lets the person who executes the idea best win in the marketplace and that protects a healthy competitive marketplace
4445177 it may look like an easy thing to do but actually growing such a copycat is just as hard as building a company thats otherwise your own original idea
4445178 se voc quer gastar menos compre para usar n o para ter
4445179 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt
4445180 we dont want any cease fire document to become the legitimization for russian occupation of georgian territories
4445181 we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4445182 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died and georgia whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect must be able to get back to normal life
4445183 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4445184 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we as we look ahead
4445185 and i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build and build their economies
4445186 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt
4445187 we dont want any cease fire document to become the legitimization for russian occupation of georgian territories
4445188 we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4445189 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died and georgia whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect must be able to get back to normal life
4445190 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4445191 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we as we look ahead
4445192 and i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build and build their economies
4445193 congressman sali informed us that a solution to the high price of gasoline was to make petroleum from
4445194 forty percent of the mass of every tree in the forest is crude oil
4445195 could put idaho in the oil business for the first time
4445196 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4445197 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4445198 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4445199 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4445200 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4445201 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4445202 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4445203 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4445204 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4445205 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4445206 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4445207 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4445208 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4445209 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4445210 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4445211 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4445212 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4445213 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4445214 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4445215 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4445216 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4445217 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4445218 natasha im glad youre here today because youre going to phase three
4445219 you proud of yourself you were pretty damn mean when you first got here girl
4445220 a person who relapses on drugs needs further treatment our responses are research driven
4445221 we have 157 000 people in the prisons of texas thats a lot
4445222 im very excited about this opportunity and looking forward to mixing it with the regulars in the world championship again
4445223 i will be carrying on from where i left off at brands hatch and hopefully taking it to the next level i want to be racing closer to the sharp end of pack with more of the big names of the world championship behind me again
4445224 terrible does anybody speak english at the other end of that phone both j and i have been trying to get a very simple problem dealt with its taken both of our times several blatant hang ups at their end countless transfers and thick indian accents to get nowhere
4445225 her order was canceled because she made a typo in the phone number not pissed off about that its our fault
4445226 i dunno what a dsn tree is man i just want the fucking laptop
4445227 so i find the number for their office in toronto yeah an english speaking person the person at the 416 area code understands my frustration and really wants to help me he says hang on ill transfer you to internet sales i say a nice thank you this helps 5 min later im back to no english speaking and more than frustrated j trying to re order for f amp ing laptop he says its canceled i know then hes needs my credit card number again before i do that i ask how long it will take he says the aug 27 i say never mind cancel my order i needed it yesterday he says mama its already canceled ugh l
4445228 to be honest i loved dell i thought i had great customer service the last time i bought a laptop no problems this time around ive never in my life have had shittier customer service awful
4445229 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
4445230 ive got to say that a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time i impacted a surface to air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again
4445231 how come everybody goes to mamma mia huh i mean really seriously huh i hate abba theyre no good you know well everybody goes theyve been selling out for years
4445232 the prisoners languishing in the prisons of tyrants be it infidels apostates or hypocrites christians or jews or infidels idolater and apostate
4445233 a couple could pretend to be joking before attacking the target
4445234 this would lead to his eyes nose and mouth being plugged and loses the ability to breathe
4445235 this type of weapon is excellent in close combat where fire arms are not desirable
4445236 but to be honest i have serious doubts that this will really happen there are many reasons for that especially on the practical side we all have our own lives our own bands and all kinds of things which we have to take care of this playing at festivals is already a very big step for me we can still have a look at all that once we have done all these festivals i think that after those gigs everybody will probably like to have some time off anyway in the beginning of our career we played so many gigs were not going to plan such a hectic tour schedule like we had in the past that would ruin everything were going to have a look at everything and then well see somebody already proposed a tour of two weeks through the states to us something like that is somehow realistic
4445237 i would be very surprised if that would really happen but never say never im always the last one who needs to be convinced michael amott guitar and jeff walker bass vocals are much more busy with those things than i am im also not very much involved in the planning of all the festivals which are scheduled at this moment i barely know in which countries were all going to play laughs
4445238 we have lost so much to vaccine injury we have lost money health happiness friends and family the desire to have more children and faith but we have not lost our family vacations thank goodness
4445239 you will need to tell us if there is anything we can do to help we cannot take off like this
4445240 i have to get off this is not right he is not capable of doing this today
4445241 oh no we wont i will not lose anymore i will not i will get a sedative from the doctor and jimmy and i will join you in a couple days

4445256 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
4445257 whatever is here seemed curious about our work the feeling we got was benign it seemed to approve of what we are doing
4445258 we both noticed it but could never find out where it was coming from
4445259 we chatted a while he asked if i been there long i said about three months
4445260 i have been in the hospital now for six months
4445261 what he had said suddenly hit me and as i drove out of the car park all the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end i had just seen a ghost
4445262 i was sure then that i had been speaking to a ghost a very sickly and consumptive one who must have died here at ventnor
4445263 beijings air quality today shows chinas growth model of develop first and clean up later is wrong and should be dropped as soon as possible

4445362 vizio in the second quarter maintained the no 3 position in the north america flat panel television market due to its increasing plasma shipments particularly in the 32 inch size range
4445363 the company is likely to remain a top player in the flat panel television business in the second half as the markets focus shifts to 120hz refresh rates for lcds and pricing becomes an increasingly important factor

4445374 all around us there is a huge policy failure on fighting terrorism we are just firefighting from case to case but there is one silver lining these incidents have failed to break communal harmony in india even in a place like gujarat
4445375 otherwise can you imagine what could have happened after bombings in temples and mosques we would never have been able to handle it it says something of indian people
4445376 my brother and i were sorting flowers and my uncle was a few feet away sitting on someones motorcycle when the bomb exploded i thought it was a short circuit i ran into a shop

4445405 it is difficult not to feel a wee bit vulnerable when an armed convoy cruises by

4445413 at headingley he bowled quite well and didnt let himself down at all perhaps there were a few nerves on day one as you might expect from a man making his test debut but on day two he was probably englands best bowler
4445414 hes been doing well since he was left out and his performances would certainly merit the selectors taking another look at him
4445415 we didnt really know anything about pattinson but we made a few phone calls to some of our contacts on the county circuit and got some information from them pretty quickly
4445416 when it came to our first innings we all studied him closely to find out what his bowling was like
4445417 he didnt ask to be selected and every player wants to represent their country he was hardly going to turn them down

4445424 who are the fortunate ones the ones who died or the ones who were spared
4445425 and again it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed and shall be healed
4445426 why should the young mother die of cancer and leave her eight children motherless why did not the lord heal her
4445427 shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and this because of their own iniquity being led captive by the will of the devil alma 40 13
4445428 as i pondered over these things which are written the eyes of my understanding were opened and the spirit of the lord rested upon me and i saw the hosts of the dead both small and great
4445429 while this vast multitude waited and conversed rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death the son of god appeared declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful and there he preached to them the everlasting gospel the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall and from individual sins on conditions of repentance
4445430 many other great truths not known before have been declared to the people and one of the greatest is that to hell there is an exit as well as an entrance hell is no place to which a vindictive judge sends prisoners to suffer and to be punished principally for his glory but it is a place prepared for the teaching the disciplining of those who failed to learn here upon the earth what they should have learned no man will be kept in hell longer than is necessary to bring him to a fitness for something better when he reaches that stage the prison doors will open and there will be rejoicing among the hosts who welcome him into a better state
4445431 when the idea was forming about ten months ago we didnt plan to gather the best blogs on everything from archeology to beekeeping to celeb gossip and we certainly didnt plan to have built in audio and video players twitter and facebook sharing or the level of social interaction we ended up with scott was working in real estate not in an i want to sell you a house kind of capacity but in a i want to use technology to improve the industry sort of way and noticed there was no site where he could go to see the best real estate blog posts without all the rubbish he decided to build one and call it regator meanwhile chris was learning php for a billiards video game he was working on he was discovering that he could do all sorts of nifty stuff pretty easily with the new language and after talking with scott about regator he spent a couple weeks teaching himself mysql and ajax so he could start building the site it wasnt long before it moved beyond scotts initial real estate focus when kimberly who is a magazine editor and therefore used to being picky about writing and content was asked to select a few blogs for the site the team was complete and the idea has been evolving ever since regators three founders live together in a little green house in georgia the u s state not the nation and our constant access to one another for brainstorming probably caused it to go in directions that it might not have otherwise gone
4445432 our biggest challenge was and still is that there are only three of us and two of us have full time day jobs
4445433 ah atlanta georgia weve got lots of streets called peachtree perfect weather and the worlds busiest airport but when it comes to a start up culture we seem to be a little lacking
4445434 at the opening ceremony it took a few seconds for li to make the right pose thats why the flame seemed to go out the flame was not put out it was just burning inside the torch and wasnt visible to the audience
4445435 the last torch has more and bigger vent holes than the others so enough air will flow through
4445436 to keep the lighting plan secret i was informed about it on july 24 we had only 10 days to develop the torch which was tested on aug 5 then we only made three of them

4445439 near a packed football stadium using an explosive attached to his body
4445440 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4445441 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4445442 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter
4445443 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4445445 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4445446 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4445447 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4445448 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4445467 solzhenitsyn delivered each line in his high pitched voice in russian the translation blunted the impact somewhat in fact there were even sporadic bursts of applause but soon enough outraged professors realized that solzhenitsyn was charging them with complicity in the wests surrender to liberal secularism the abandonment of its christian heritage and with all the moral horrors that followed
4445468 moral impoverishment had led to a debased definition of freedom that makes no distinction between freedoms for good and freedoms for evil our founders he reminded us would scarcely have countenanced all this freedom with no purpose but for the satisfaction of ones whims they demanded that freedom be granted conditionally upon the individuals constant exercise of his religious responsibility
4445469 fashionable trends of thoughts and ideas are fastidiously separated from those that are not fashionable
4445470 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days
4445471 should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
4445472 every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the achievement of happiness in the morally inferior sense which has come into being during those same decades in the process however one psychological detail has been overlooked the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression though it is customary to conceal such feelings

4445530 for the last 11 years ken has steered the club forwards always with the best interests of the club at heart and i am hoping people will turn out in force to hear what he has to say
4445531 we will have the two sides of the stadium open but we also have a task force ready to open other areas if need be
4445532 whatever the turn out we will be able to handle it
4445533 that seemed to be like the beginning of the end
4445534 ive never felt like that before after a game of rugby league especially as captain
4445535 it was really demoralising we let the fans down and we let the club down in general we were pretty much awful
4445536 if a win on saturday keeps us on track for the top six and a couple of other results go our way then thats great
4445537 i decided to take these two weeks off from tournament golf as with automatic qualification now out of the question i thought it very important to put in some serious practice time so i am ready to perform to the best of my ability should i come into the reckoning for a captains selection
4445538 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4445539 after these few days with my wife and family i am ready to get down to some serious hard work at gleneagles which is no more than 10 minutes from home so some long hours can easily be put in
4445540 hopefully the crowds will inspire me to a great week it will be a really strong tournament with so many european players in the field battling to improve their positions on the european ryder cup rankings in the final qualifying event
4445541 i think the spectators are in for a great week weather permitting

4445545 its unfortunate because we do feel like we beat ourselves more than anything
4445546 they got some hits at the end but it got a little bit out of hand due to ourselves
4445547 i really thought we needed someone to come out and put zeros up so we could get the bats going
4445548 we have encountered problems with his insurance and are currently looking at different possible ways of working around that

4445568 even after rfid conversion libraries want to retain barcodes to have a visible number on their collection items for various uses and a logo to identify items that are loaned to other branches and libraries the 3m print conversion system handles all of that in one step plus weeding its one of the most efficient conversion systems available and eliminates the cost of buying barcodes for future additions to the library collection
4445569 we want libraries to have the freedom to make changes as easily and cost effectively as possible especially because an iso standardized format may be issued in the not too distant future
4445570 the 3m print conversion system is another important step forward for the productivity gains that rfid is bringing to libraries around the world
4445571 as the demand for library services increases at a time when budgets are static at best we are making this technology easy to use so that every library staff member can perform his or her tasks with greater efficiency and job satisfaction

4445577 ik was wel bezig met het maken van websites voor mensen echt als hobby maar toen was er ineens iemand die een factuur wilde hebben nou ja toen heb ik me maar ingeschreven bij de kamer van koophandel daarna is het balletje gaan rollen en kwamen er steeds meer klanten
4445578 we zijn ooit gestart met het ontwikkelen van websites maar nu is het veel meer alles wat maar met ict te maken heeft kunnen klanten bij ons krijgen
4445579 ik vind het leuk om vanuit het een bedrijf te starten maar ik kan bijvoorbeeld absoluut niet vormgeven daarom werk ik ook met freelancers
4445580 ik ben er bovendien van overtuigd dat het werken met n vaste vormgever slecht is voor de creativiteit van een bedrijf daarom bekijken we per keer wie geschikt is voor de opdracht want daar gaat het bij een creatief proces tenslotte om
4445581 de klanten vinden het eigenlijk eerder leuk dan een belemmering
4445582 je moet als ondernemer gewoon betrouwbaar zijn als wij het verpesten heeft de klant geen inkomen en ze verwachten een bepaald niveau veel starters pakken het in het begin niet professioneel aan en dat kan ze tegenwerken
4445583 ik denk dat het belangrijk is om zon forum te bezoeken ik heb er in ieder geval veel waardevolle adviezen gekregen als je een eigen bedrijf wil starten en je denkt dat je alles al weet dan kom je er niet en ik denk dat je ook goed moet weten wat je kunt en vooral wat je n et kunt maar ik vind wel dat je uiteindelijk je eigen beslissing moet nemen en een eigen mening moet hebben anders gebeurt er niks
4445584 ik vond de opleiding niet meer geschikt voor mij omdat die erg theoretisch was echt ondernemen leer je daar niet ik ben praktischer ingesteld

4445597 i got undercut and hurt my knee but i thought it was just a sprain i stayed down there two more months and it didnt get any better
4445598 things couldnt have been any better for me last season
4445599 we won a national championship and i had a chance to be around a great quarterback in matt flynn he showed me how to lead a team and how to pull a team together im excited to build off of that
4445600 hes very even keel very cerebral he plays and lives at the same level even when he gets hit hard or throws an interception he bounces right back hes just not a guy that gets intimidated
4445601 he doesnt have to do everything hes got a lot of people on that team that can do great things andrews role is to make good decisions and manage the offense well thats his forte hes good at making good decisions under pressure
4445602 i remember in high school he went four for five in a baseball game
4445603 he lined out in his last at bat and was like why couldnt i have gone five for five
4445604 andrew is a perfectionist our whole family used to pray that hed have good games so wed have a good weekend he feels like he should do well every single time
4445605 that doesnt always make things easy on him or us but its obviously served him well

4445611 thats at the back of my mind as well if i had to pick a course for it the cup bid to end gleneagles would be it but just having a sniff at a ryder cup place is a great feeling

4445624 also a major consideration was retention of nutrients in the juice we wanted to reduce any negative influences on the juice quality in the bag process it was not uncommon that because of the load we were putting on the freezers each day by adding large amounts of unfrozen juice it could take up to 18 hours for us to have a complete freeze on the juice bags
4445625 because we are dealing with a fresh juice degradation of the juice starts immediately after liberation in the press granted it is small initially but it does accelerate until the juice is stabilized either through drying or freezing we were seeing by products of oxidation in our juice bags because we are dealing with chlorophyll the first sign of oxidation is browning while this occurrence was not normally detectable by the naked eye a colour meter would be used to measure the change
4445626 now that we are using the berg freezing system we are literally freezing instantly and the frozen juice when measured is showing zero signs of browning through oxidation this literally impacts our bottom line since it is a requirement from some of our customers that we meet a minimum chlorophyll level our thawed juice from the berg freeze system is literally the brilliant green of fresh juice
4445627 we have improved our frozen juice quality dramatically we have eliminated wasteful and costly handling steps increased production as we now are freezing more juice at a higher solid level per 24 hour period we have less manpower requirement freeing up staff for other tasks

4445819 esta diferencia de trato por raz n de la edad
4445820 perjudica a las personas m s d biles econ micamente
4445821 ante la sospecha de una baja respuesta a la estimulaci n
4445822 que la nica soluci n ser a la realizaci n de un test de fecundidad in vitro fiv y se le remiti al hospital de cruces
4445823 seg n el protocolo s lo se hace con menos de 40 a os
4445824 en reconocimiento a su derecho a recibir el tratamiento in vitro a cargo del servicio vasco de salud denegado en atenci n a su edad
4445825 aunque la edad de la mujer receptora es uno de los factores que condicionan la probabilidad de la gestaci n por medio de la fiv esta t cnica est en constante cambio y los avances que se han producido en los ltimos a os se han traducido en un aumento de las tasas de xito terap utico m s all
4445826 resulta significativo que la gu a de recomendaciones en reproducci n asistida elaborada en 2007 por muface mutualidad general de funcionarios civiles del estado en base a pautas facilitadas por prestigiosos profesionales de la sanidad p blica y privada establece que la edad l mite de la mujer para realizar la estimulaci n ov rica y aplicar las t cnicas de inseminaci n artificial son los 42 a os y la edad m xima recomendada para acceder a la t cnica del fiv con donaci n de ovocitos y preembriones as como para la transferencia de preembriones congelados sobrantes de ciclos fiv autorizados son los 46 a os
4445827 la mayor capacidad financiera del sistema los cambios sociales producidos en los ltimos a os al ser tambi n notorios hechos como el crecimiento de la tasa de infertilidad el retraso del momento elegido por las mujeres para ser madres la creciente demanda de esta t cnica y su concentraci n en personas cada vez m s mayores as como las propias sentencias del sistema que determinan que entre la primera cita por problemas de fertilidad y la fecha programada para la aplicaci n de la t cnica de fecundaci n in vitro puedan transcurrir varios a os
4445828 supone la aplicaci n autom tica y no personalizada de un tope de edad que puede llevar a situaciones de frustraci n de las expectativas creadas por el sistema y de denegaci n de la prestaci n legalmente reconocida totalmente injustificadas
4445829 la pretendida aplicaci n del criterio de la edad por parte de los distintos hospitales p blicos no tiene car cter vinculante
4445830 no puede confundirse un protocolo de actuaci n de car cter general elaborado por el servicio vasco de salud con una mera gu a informativa confeccionada por el jefe de la unidad de reproducci n asistida de un centro hospitalario
4445831 decae la conclusi n a la que llega en relaci n a la existencia de un l mite de edad para realizar la t cnica fiv en el mbito del servicio vasco de salud configurado como condici n de acceso a la prestaci n que fue el motivo por el que le fue negada a la recurrida v a administrativa
4445832 existe una indicaci n facultativa para ese tratamiento por parte del servicio de ginecolog a del hospital de txagorritxu dependiente de osakidetza lo que presupone la existencia de posibilidades razonables de xito
4445833 este organismo no puede denegarlo por el mero hecho de que la interesada tuviera 41 a os cumplidos
4445834 y el documento elaborado por el jefe de la unidad de reproducci n asistida del hospital de cruces carece de fuerza vinculante
4445835 su indicaci n y aplicaci n deber realizarse a la vista de las concretas circunstancias personales m dicas biol gicas y psicol gicas concurrentes en cada caso incluida la edad de la candidata y sus valores hormonales que permitir n determinar las posibilidades de xito y los eventuales riesgos para la solicitante y el feto
4445836 es razonablemente efectiva para la aplicaci n de dicha t cnica
4445837 adem s de carecer de base legal y suponer una diferencia de trato por raz n de la edad que no aparece debidamente justificada ni en la forma ni en el fondo perjudica en mayor medida a las personas m s d biles econ micamente que carecen de medios para costearse el tratamiento en medicina privada

4445871 the film is not joker its salmans idea and he wants shirish to direct it the talks began when they bumped into each other at an event and connected the film will be a james bond like stylish action thriller with hollywood technicians its being made on a very huge scale and salman might even produce it
4445872 the ref cant make that call that early in the game
4445873 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4445874 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4445875 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4445876 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4445877 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4445878 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies

4445883 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4445884 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4445885 it was a beautiful thing to watch all those people lift up that bus
4445886 weve seen some bad movies come from the yash raj films stable recently maybe thats why expectations from its films have been low and openings have been bad
4445887 earlier yash raj would come up with original scripts which would only get the green light after a lot of work had been done on them
4445888 that meticulous work used to show in the quality of films now they only rely on those scripts already available in the market this might be why their films are flopping left right and centre
4445889 to be honest i think yrf has taken a risk with bachna ae haseeno
4445890 it is not the banners fault its films arent doing well the banner will keep giving a platform to various filmmakers but the problem often lies with the story no banner however big it may be can save a film if the story is not good
4445891 i have worked with aditya chopra in salaam e ishq hes a sincere and hardworking person yash raj films has always given great films and i am sure it will bounce back with bachna ae haseeno it seems to be a fresh film and ranbir is a talented guy
4445892 hits and flops are a part of bollywood sometimes certain stories dont appeal to audiences i think bachna ae haseeno will change the banners luck
4445893 it does look trendy and the music is good too it has the ingredients of a blockbuster but in this industry you cant predict anything when jhoom barabar jhoom was to release we were planning the release of mahesh bhatts jannat when i saw the promos of jhoom barabar jhoom i told bhatt we should postpone our film by two weeks because it was much smaller in scale but look what happened jhoom barabar jhoom bombed and jannat did well
4445894 the promos are promising the song has been remixed well and its fresh look is sure to grab eyeballs
4445895 shah rukh is hot property in india and overseas the film already has buyers
4445896 i signed the film before saawariya yash raj films had confidence in my potential and they signed me on
4445897 no they didnt sign me because i am raj kapoors grandson but because they believed in my talent i expect the film to do well as it has all the necessary ingredients
4445898 i cannot compete with him all i know is i have done my job well all i can do now is keep my fingers crossed that the film does well
4445899 yash raj films believes in every film it produces most of our films have been blockbusters globally including the recent dhoom 2 chak de india and fanaa
4445900 some films have not done as well as we would have liked but each of our films gets the same attention care and marketing bachna ae haseeno is a film that we hope will do well it has been painstakingly produced and has created a lot of enthusiasm among audiences
4445901 yash raj has given the film industry top heroes like vinod khanna rishi kapoor and others so it is just a matter of time
4445902 situa es muito espec ficas num contexto de milh es de cirurgias que o brasil realiza
4445903 i really like the stock but i just dont see a catalyst for the stock going forward
4445904 a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change
4445905 it is this kind of agreement the the split between russia and the united states over the problem of south ossetia l that may have a greater impact on the growth of tensions in russian american relations
4445906 this is one of our plans to cripple the economic base of rivers state
4445907 as a state we are ready to collaborate with federal agencies to begin to build new and modern prisons that incorporate best practices in reforms and rehabilitation by society
4445908 it is evident that the system as it currently exists was never intended to reform indigenes who were agitating for independence and therefore we must develop a prison system that suits the citizens of this state and comparable to foreign jurisdiction
4445909 they are overcrowded and not the kind of prisons that this country should refer to as prisons in the twenty first century
4445910 no treaty between the federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the national assembly
4445911 even if the government has scoffed at the ruling of justice muhammed umar of the federal high court sitting in abuja restraining the fg from handing over the peninsula until the determination of the case brought by bakassi indigenes it cannot afford to trash the nigerian constitution
4445912 the nigeria labour congress wishes to react to the renewed and repeated threats by the federal government to increase the prices of petroleum products at the end of the extended moratorium
4445913 the nlc remains opposed to any increase in the prices of petroleum products at the moment fuel prices in nigeria are unbearable for the poor working people industry operators and other productive players in the economy our fuel prices are among the highest in opec
4445914 we are at pains to understand why ajumogobia should reduce a serious issue to simple minded declarations
4445915 it is fraudulent for the minister and other agents of government to insist that the subsidy is largely for the rich car owners
4445916 i have just come into nigeria and what i met on ground is unhealthy
4445917 this is bad for the airline it had to carry us to competitors in its buses
4445918 apart from countries where they have witnessed wars and other major conflicts nigeria ranks highest among countries that have recorded rampant vandalism of telecommunications equipment in the world and this is very disturbing
4445919 build a strong brand which could compete effectively and drive the companys quest to become one of the top 10 global telecommunications players in the world
4445920 our cost of operations will begin to go down due to the economies of scale of being a member of a large group a big global player as we negotiate better and pay less for equipment and other resources
4445921 there have been various reports in the national newspapers on the demotion of 140 officers of the nigeria police force which has attracted tremendous public interest
4445922 i am fully in support of the crusade against corruption indeed i am totally against it
4445923 so in cases such as this we must do thorough investigation and avoid playing to the gallery
4445924 it is mind boggling that the man was said to have burnt n270 million in a cemetery
4445925 yet we shouldnt dissolve the whole place nddc board because of one man and stall the progress that is being made already
4445926 a continuation of the obsolete divide and rule tactics of an abuja cabal and its sometimes naive niger deltan agents that is determined to starve the nddc of statutorily due funding stultify development in the region thus preventing peace from being secured and so continue to negatively manipulate the global energy crisis for their myopic and greedy self serving ends
4445927 none of us must be too hasty to propose any steps that could further weaken the fragile development and peace process currently being delicately managed by the federal government with less than desired success to show for all the bluster and rhetorics let us all seek the aggregate best for the common good of our peoples eschewing self serving vendettas
4445928 which suggests that he had no direct access to nddc funds
4445929 undedss hereby reiterates its demand that the over n325 billion statutory funds owed the nddc by the federal government of nigeria be immediately released to the nddc for optimal implementation of the opening phases of the niger delta master plan
4445930 undedss cautions that no obfuscatory attempts to distract the peoples of the region from getting what is due them including this disingenuous attempt to demonise the nddc management and so maybe stall the regions development drive will deter niger deltans from standing up for the right thing and their rights it is a new dawn the niger delta renaissance has started nobody can stop it
4445931 such campaigns of calumny have failed in the past because the good peoples of the region are still satisfied with alaibes stewardship to date
4445932 is it not funny that a man who is alleged to have been a target of edems alleged diabolically murderous acts is now suddenly being positioned as villain against all evidence to the contrary
4445933 even vice president goodluck jonathan singled alaibe out for praise at a recent aso rock niger delta stakeholders meeting extolling his virtues as one of the most effective facilitators of the comprehensive process of peace and progress of the region
4445934 the president means business on this issue and want to see more commitment in this direction
4445935 if you are observant you must have noticed improvement in power supply in the last three weeks that is because some things have been done by the federal government within the last one month the president has effectively tackled the problem of system collapse which has gone on for years
4445936 he president has also sorted out the issue of funding for the short term with the governors and once the monies are duly appropriated in the states houses of assembly and by the national assembly everything will be in place
4445937 but there are some technical details that are being sorted out with the international oil companies
4445938 some of them are showing signs of non cooperation but now they are beginning to realise the resolve of the president because once the emergency is declared in the power sector there will be stiff sanctions if they fail to meet their obligations and all these will be clearly spelt out as pre condition for continued operations in our country
4445939 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4445946 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4445947 its a pretty big jump in manufacturing capacity and a big opportunity for the pv industry particularly for thin film
4445948 sunpower is ramping very quickly by 2010 our production will be at least 650 megawatts
4445949 and after building some 40 megawatts of power plants in spain sunpower has been able to improve its manufacturing processes and cut costs according to blunden
4445950 we could see where the cost reductions were coming down and the benefits of scal e
4445951 we saw there was a way for us to be competitive with other renewables
4445952 by taking control of the value chain from start to finish by being vertically integrated and cutting out the middleman
4445953 we can be competitive not only with other renewable energy but with conventional energy

4445973 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4445974 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4445975 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4445976 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4445977 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4445978 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4445979 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4445980 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4445984 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4445985 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4445986 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4445987 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4445988 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4445989 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4445990 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4445991 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4445992 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4446024 the unique part of this mission was the incorporation of a maintenance task force from an operational missile wing
4446025 for me the unique part of this launch was seeing all the moving pieces coming together
4446026 we had maintenance and operations teams from up north working together with us in the squadron the coordination we did with the 30th space wing who manages the range as well as the army and the navy who supported the mission downrange
4446027 im very proud of the team of professionals involved in making this test a success
4446028 their technical expertise dedication and adherence to perfection as the standard have ensured our nations icbm fleet is capable and extremely accurate
4446029 for the past 50 years vandenberg has been at the forefront of testing and improving american ballistic missiles
4446030 thanks to the hard work of team vandenberg we continue a proud legacy of assuring the readiness and reliability of our icbm fleet

4446032 over 10 000 competitors will converge on the gold coast in november for what has become a major biennial event and tatianas involvement this year is a great coup
4446033 tatiana has been a tremendous representative for australia in international athletics competition for over a decade and is now enjoying her athletic retirement as a queensland business woman and gold coast property owner she will be a great ambassador for this great event
4446034 the gold coast convention amp exhibition centre will be the official games village featuring live nightly entertainment a sports expo and fully catered hospitality
4446035 with more than 80 percent of participants coming from outside the gold coast broadbeach has plenty of great accommodation dining and entertainment options for our visitors as they experience all the gold coast has to offer
4446036 entries are already flowing in for all 34 sports on the program which following a record turn out at the 2008 gold coast airport marathon is a testament to the world class destination the gold coast is on the sports tourism calendar
4446037 it is an honour to be ambassador of a major queensland and australian event like the pan pacific masters games
4446038 there is something for everybody an opportunity to play sport competitively in all age groups as well as being able to socialize with fellow competitors and team mates
4446039 i think the slogan sums it up well play it live it love it
4446040 the object of these schemes is to defraud the government and the taxpaying public ci will continue to aggressively pursue those who file false tax returns to claim refunds for which they are not entitled
4446041 this significant investment in policing infrastructure is enabling officers to provide improved service delivery to the community of wujal wujal
4446042 for the first time wujal wujal now has a permanent policing presence
4446043 prior to february 2006 police had to travel the 75km around one and half hours from cooktown to provide assistance to this community
4446044 in february 2006 we began rostering police on rotation in wujal wujal working out of a council residence on douglas drive and herloin street
4446045 while this assisted in ensuring faster response times police did not have appropriate infrastructure to support their operations and without permanent officers there was limited opportunity for building partnerships between police and the community
4446046 since this new station became operational in april this year local police have been developing strong ties with the local community justice group businesses and the school
4446047 the new officer in charge sergeant craig roberts is taking a proactive approach to crime prevention working on community partnerships to reduce alcohol abuse domestic violence and truancy
4446048 with constable mick rumble set to take up his position at the station shortly im sure these initiatives will continue to grow
4446049 the people of wujal wujal have shown great support for their local police and the development of this new station
4446050 now with greater access to their local officers im sure this support will continue
4446051 with a permanent police presence and strong community partnerships we can continue to build a safer community
4446052 receiving reaccreditation further solidifies the air forces museum as one of national prominence and prestige
4446053 the commitment of the board staff volunteers and foundation to uphold the highest standards of the museum practice is shown with this award

4446055 but for commercial and closed source platforms its just a black box test
4446056 happily dixons bracing initiation is even handed enough to inspire jolts of defensive ire in readers of every stripe
4446057 this is a great example of the capability to let our airmen submit their forms and have a systematic visibility on their status throughout the chain of command
4446058 commanders could have reports in coordination without knowing their status
4446059 now guard and reserve commanders can know exactly where all their reports are by looking on vpc gr

4446063 these letters are examples of tier 0 service at its finest

4446080 in the big company world you come in you build a foundation
4446081 youre kind of a generalist but at startups from day one youve got to have a developed skill youll have to do operational finance on day one or fundraising on day one unless youve got a grand idea like bill gates or the facebook guy if you arent the founder youve got to have a plan to build skills so people come to you its different from big companies where they expect you to be smart and hard working but they will invest in building skills in a startup if you dont have the skills they change you out like underwear
4446082 its so much easier to move a startup if youre not moving youre probably dying
4446083 you defined the market but its not quite what you thought so you quickly change and adapt all the time
4446084 leadership means moving quickly if youre on the wrong track being bold is so important whereas big companies are proven and the skill there is orchestrating and knowing how to motivate and energize a big organization thats already successful

4446113 no necesitamos que la polic a nos proteja cuando llevamos las planillas o manifiestos de carga con las tarifas que se exigen si estamos cumpliendo no hay ning n riesgo de hecho a los generadores de carga que ya han entendido que es as los transportdores les hemos movido la carga los que est n buscando el acuerdo o la protecci n uniformada son los que conservan fletes de ruina para el camionero esos s necesitan protecci n porque est n abusando de los camioneros
4446114 seguimos trabajando y as lo haremos con todos aquellos due os de carga con las tarifas establecidas en la tabla de fletes

4446170 my fundamental opposition to obamas presidential candidacy involves public policy differences
4446171 the sexual attraction of his mother to her african husband jumps out from the page
4446172 how much more imagining hypothetical lying or just plain lying is obama capable of doing
4446173 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois how about in the u s senate
4446174 obama had to know that running for political office even state office would be much more difficult to do if voters suspected he was a muslim
4446175 yet once obama became a member of trinity he had proof he was a christian as he professed to be
4446176 if i may be so bold there was another president
4446177 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4446178 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4446179 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this

4446190 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4446191 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4446192 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4446193 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women

4446202 mccains inability to match bushs performance in attracting traditional republican donors illustrates the fundraising gap between the candidates salant finds
4446203 obama is seeking to bring in double or triple the 84 1 million in federal funds that mccain will have to spend in the final two months before the nov 4 election in june obama declined to accept public financing which caps his spending at the federal allotment
4446204 not all republicans are opening their wallets to a mccain presidential run mallory factor a banker who co hosts a weekly meeting of conservatives in new york and raised more than 1 million for bush and his party four years ago told bloomberg
4446205 some republicans who support certain principles are shunning mccain factor said citing the arizona senators initial opposition to bushs tax cuts and his authorship of a campaign finance law opposed by many in his party

4446258 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4446259 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4446260 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4446261 as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4446262 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year

4446278 just like you and i inhale oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide these bugs breathe in arsenic iii and breathe out arsenic v
4446279 we took a very business like approach to the race
4446280 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1000 metres we owned it
4446281 we probably relaxed just a bit more than we should have in the last 500 metres it would have been nice to finish first in the semi but were in the final and thats important
4446282 i was incredibly nervous the entire morning leading up to the competition and i didnt really know why
4446283 what happened today is good but im going to leave it behind me and know that saturday we all start at zero
4446284 a big high and then six outs away from even a higher high
4446285 of course i wanted to break the canadian record but to swim an olympic final and improve my ranking is something that i will cherish forever i always knew i had it in me to make an olympic final and today was the highlight of my career
4446286 to go in and be in the race with these girls and swim a lifetime best is just amazing
4446287 you were sad and worried when the boy entered kindergarten you were sad and worried when he entered 1st grade you were sad and worried when he entered 2nd grade you were sad and worried when he entered 3rd grade you were sad and worried when he entered 4th grade and you were sad and worried when he entered 5th grade it all worked out fine
4446288 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4446289 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4446290 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4446291 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4446292 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4446293 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4446294 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4446295 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4446296 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4446297 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4446298 esta diferencia de trato por raz n de la edad
4446299 perjudica a las personas m s d biles econ micamente
4446300 ante la sospecha de una baja respuesta a la estimulaci n
4446301 que la nica soluci n ser a la realizaci n de un test de fecundidad in vitro fiv y se le remiti al hospital de cruces
4446302 seg n el protocolo s lo se hace con menos de 40 a os
4446303 en reconocimiento a su derecho a recibir el tratamiento in vitro a cargo del servicio vasco de salud denegado en atenci n a su edad
4446304 aunque la edad de la mujer receptora es uno de los factores que condicionan la probabilidad de la gestaci n por medio de la fiv esta t cnica est en constante cambio y los avances que se han producido en los ltimos a os se han traducido en un aumento de las tasas de xito terap utico m s all
4446305 resulta significativo que la gu a de recomendaciones en reproducci n asistida elaborada en 2007 por muface mutualidad general de funcionarios civiles del estado en base a pautas facilitadas por prestigiosos profesionales de la sanidad p blica y privada establece que la edad l mite de la mujer para realizar la estimulaci n ov rica y aplicar las t cnicas de inseminaci n artificial son los 42 a os y la edad m xima recomendada para acceder a la t cnica del fiv con donaci n de ovocitos y preembriones as como para la transferencia de preembriones congelados sobrantes de ciclos fiv autorizados son los 46 a os
4446306 la mayor capacidad financiera del sistema los cambios sociales producidos en los ltimos a os al ser tambi n notorios hechos como el crecimiento de la tasa de infertilidad el retraso del momento elegido por las mujeres para ser madres la creciente demanda de esta t cnica y su concentraci n en personas cada vez m s mayores as como las propias sentencias del sistema que determinan que entre la primera cita por problemas de fertilidad y la fecha programada para la aplicaci n de la t cnica de fecundaci n in vitro puedan transcurrir varios a os
4446307 supone la aplicaci n autom tica y no personalizada de un tope de edad que puede llevar a situaciones de frustraci n de las expectativas creadas por el sistema y de denegaci n de la prestaci n legalmente reconocida totalmente injustificadas
4446308 la pretendida aplicaci n del criterio de la edad por parte de los distintos hospitales p blicos no tiene car cter vinculante
4446309 no puede confundirse un protocolo de actuaci n de car cter general elaborado por el servicio vasco de salud con una mera gu a informativa confeccionada por el jefe de la unidad de reproducci n asistida de un centro hospitalario
4446310 decae la conclusi n a la que llega en relaci n a la existencia de un l mite de edad para realizar la t cnica fiv en el mbito del servicio vasco de salud configurado como condici n de acceso a la prestaci n que fue el motivo por el que le fue negada a la recurrida v a administrativa
4446311 existe una indicaci n facultativa para ese tratamiento por parte del servicio de ginecolog a del hospital de txagorritxu dependiente de osakidetza lo que presupone la existencia de posibilidades razonables de xito
4446312 este organismo no puede denegarlo por el mero hecho de que la interesada tuviera 41 a os cumplidos
4446313 y el documento elaborado por el jefe de la unidad de reproducci n asistida del hospital de cruces carece de fuerza vinculante
4446314 su indicaci n y aplicaci n deber realizarse a la vista de las concretas circunstancias personales m dicas biol gicas y psicol gicas concurrentes en cada caso incluida la edad de la candidata y sus valores hormonales que permitir n determinar las posibilidades de xito y los eventuales riesgos para la solicitante y el feto
4446315 es razonablemente efectiva para la aplicaci n de dicha t cnica
4446316 adem s de carecer de base legal y suponer una diferencia de trato por raz n de la edad que no aparece debidamente justificada ni en la forma ni en el fondo perjudica en mayor medida a las personas m s d biles econ micamente que carecen de medios para costearse el tratamiento en medicina privada
4446317 no privilegiar el personal deseo de acceder a la maternidad por encima de cualesquiera riesgos expresos y advertidos f sicos psicosociales y otros con consecuencias indeseables normalmente para el nacido que puede conllevar el fen meno de la maternidad tard a
4446318 defender un planteamiento legal y judicial donde el concepto paternidad maternidad no se encuentre determinado por el simple deseo de apetencia o exigencia sino tambi n por el hecho biol gico m dico o por fines esencialmente terap uticos
4446319 todo aquello que protege o da cobertura en mbito privado no puede ser exigible al p blico merced a una mal denominada discriminaci n por su costeamiento o debilidad econ mica
4446320 if the whole country keeps on praying we can bring down prices even more to even less than 2
4446321 congress as usual is divided lord what else can we do
4446322 is that the intelligence community should invest in research for detecting and measuring psychological states via neurophysiological markers pharmacological developments along with other neuroimaging advances the potential growth in computer modeling of cognition and distributed human machine systems complicity of psychologists in the torture of detainees by the us military and intelligence agencies
4446323 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4446324 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4446325 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4446326 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4446327 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4446328 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4446329 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4446330 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4446331 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4446332 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4446333 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4446334 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4446335 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4446336 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4446337 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4446338 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans

4446342 the focus is not there it is on football and other sports
4446343 a lot of kids play basketball at a young age but as they get older the attention and the facilities are not there so they go in a different direction
4446344 i believe the game is growing here in the uk which is going to help a lot of kids with a lot of talent so hopefully theyll have a brighter future
4446345 back of the envelope guesstimate that i wont go into further here except to say that if the price of oil were to remain in the 133 120 range it is in now i would expect the year end inflation rate to be something like 3
4446346 eating in this hot weather should be made a careful consideration by everybody
4446347 it is not a known fact but fat meat especially salt pork is one of the best things to eat during hot weather the stomach will digest bacon when it will not digest anything else
4446348 we must seize the opportunity to show the world thatthe whole financial industry can be successful when westrengthen cooperation in tax questions
4446349 tdc cannot at this point in time give further informationabout if and when the negotiations may be completed and whetheror not this will lead to a transaction
4446350 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4446351 the fate of yahoo is not going to change by any addition of these board members
4446352 he is very well aware of the advertising community of madison avenue and the value of content
4446353 boards are typically going to pay a premium for what they consider to be a brand name
4446354 more and more women have a name in the worlds largest companies were starting to see the benefits of them realizing that
4446355 often times they feel that women can bring that out of the box thinking to the leadership role
4446356 they might have the relationship skills to drive a new culture and strategy through an organization
4446357 has no idea why someone would need one of these
4446358 she was sorry but the network was down but that it should be up any minute
4446359 the programme has been heavily pre funded and hasgenerated a great deal of interest
4446360 we are excited by the results which reveal valuableinformation related to the prospectivity of the survey areas
4446361 the no 2 sru claus unit was down from 11 33 a m to 11 52 a m theno 2 scot is still down by the time of reporting
4446362 it did collapse in the manner it was designed to collapse it just did not collapse when it was supposed to obviously
4446363 everything was progressing normally and then suddenly without warning a connection of one leg to the body seemed to fail
4446364 we believe nordstrom will offset some of this competitive pressure by planning inventory leanly in line with sales less markdown risk and prudent cost control
4446365 moderating sales trends significant california exposure and a wealthier customer that will not benefit from the stimulus checks
4446366 project porchlight is a great way to get ideas on how to decorate the yard and create flower beds
4446367 i saw all kinds of great things when i was doing porchlight
4446368 trees waterfalls different types of flowers and where to put them shady spots sunny spots
4446369 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4446370 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4446371 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4446372 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4446373 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4446374 hes sick hes got an addiction he needs treatment hes sick you know there is treatment for this kind of addiction a lot of men have gone through the treatment with a lot of success but he wont do it because he is in denial
4446375 if obama wins he will win by a landslide margin if mccain wins it will be a very small margin
4446376 if it had to be a foreigner couldnt it have been a german
4446377 if you want to find someone dont be a douch bag
4446378 robinho has felt slightly ignored in some aspects but he is happy with his team mates and with schuster he loves madrid
4446379 president ramon calderon told us that he would not leave for 100m they are doing with robinho what manchester united have done with cristiano ronaldo
4446380 if he stays next year he would be able to leave for a lot smaller fee than the 32m 25m now on offer from chelsea
4446381 we saw this car in may of 06 and all of us were just freaking out finally a car
4446382 zenn was the first neighborhood electric car that actually looked and felt and drove like a real car everything else before that was either a converted golf cart or a car that was built from the ground up
4446383 and if they do get into a collision the impact is much less severe
4446384 we would be able to sell as many of these cars as theyre selling hondas and toyotas
4446385 even if they made it a 30 000 car easily we could have toyota numbers theres enough people out there who are tired of paying high prices for gas who dont like buying and supporting foreign oil
4446386 since joining the microgaming poker network weve enjoyed a strong working partnership and so this decision has actually been straightforward microgamings casino software has an outstanding reputation in the industry for delivering cutting edge graphic rich games and one of the most reliable platforms in the business critical when running any online operation
4446387 we are delighted that unibet has decided to extend our relationship with the addition of our proven casino platform and very much look forward to a continued successful partnership in the last year weve achieved a number of major initiatives that will significantly benefit our operators and have a strong pipeline of innovative tools and games coming this year to power operator profits so when a partner such as unibet picks us to power multiple software products its further proof that we are delivering where it counts
4446388 i have this problem in a bad way one moment ill have very strong 3g reception and in the next ill have dropped the signal and switched to edge i can barely keep a call from dropping on 3g and this is in san jose and san francisco metro not the back woods
4446389 honestly at this point im a lot happier just turning off 3g and running the thing on edge all the time battery life is much improved obviously without all the switching and most applications run at a reasonable speed most importantly calls dont drop
4446390 i really do hope i can use the 3g on my iphone 3g sometime soon though thats kinda why i bought it
4446391 its entirely possible that theres a huge problem with the chips the phones or the network
4446392 its also possible that the press is going to latch onto any problems with the iphone because writing the word iphone guarantees people read the article cell phone reception varies so i can only report on what im seeing i have used the iphone almost daily since i got it and have had bugs a lot of random slowness some minor app crashes and issues with the battery it dies before the end of the day and you cant carry a spare battery but ive had no problems with reception
4446393 it may have been a temporary glitch or volume overload
4446394 listening to your customers for a large corporation very important but why just for iphone users i am in possession of an htc diamond but say the direct counterpart of the iphone my range is dramatically bad
4446395 it is certainly not the iphone i have an mda vario iii and also has poor coverage in various places in the country
4446396 my main issue with all of this is apples complete and utter silence on the matter what would be the harm in acknowledging the issue and saying we will have a fix in short order it wouldnt hurt and most likely would garner apple more respect
4446397 wow those numbers are definitely impressive we all knew it was going to be successful but i doubt any of us would have predicted this
4446398 and this is with how shall i say a flood of less than stellar apps imagine how this store will do once it grows to include more useful applications
4446399 iinet is offering itunes content quota free which is great hopefully other isps will follow
4446400 my guess is that its not just apple its that the usage rules for online rentals are based on what the rights holders want and demand and what the infrastructure supports
4446401 it did collapse in the manner it was designed to collapse it just did not collapse when it was supposed to obviously
4446402 everything was progressing normally and then suddenly without warning a connection of one leg to the body seemed to fail
4446403 none of the lifting mechanism was affected the structure is safe secure and stable
4446404 since seventh grade i think when he was taking metal class in junior high he wanted to be an iron worker so he loved it and they loved him also i could see from the emotions the outpouring down there that it was quite a scene when they had to take him out
4446405 one of the legs just collapsed like 300 feet out of the air i dont know what they were doing but i dont think it was supposed to have happened
4446406 there was a person who said yes you gotta get out of here now
4446407 its a visible sign of americas commitment to our security the missiles are not directed against anybody but its something that we feel we deserve being members of nato for 10 years now and having very little in terms of nato security infrastructure
4446408 and said during his visit to the georgian capital tbilisi on tuesday that russia had
4446409 most children in some point in their lives fantasize about travel into space or becoming an astronaut
4446410 it seemed very natural that at the very least i would want to find a way to connect to the player community during my time in space
4446411 we will leave it as a permanent archive away from the potential disaster that might befall the surface of the earth
4446412 i think there is no question that they will enjoy it at many levels
4446413 we think the players will find it both fictionally really fitting as well as just from a practical standpoint the chance to get their own data sent into space
4446414 i have a very substantial load of commercial and research activity ive actually presold the results of a lot of the commercial work that i am doing in areas like protein crystal growth that is of use to pharmaceutical companies
4446415 thats how i spend my spare time adventuring into the reality in which we live
4446416 social media companies are always going to have to be careful about the conversations that go on their networks
4446417 slander illegal acts and copyright issues are all potential risks since user generated content is by nature unpredictable
4446418 there are a number of laws out there that can be potentially violated on a social networking site
4446419 people have gotten nailed and lost their jobs when it has been discovered what they said on online industry forums
4446420 especially in the business networks the question becomes to what extent is your comment your own and to what extent does it represent the view of your employer
4446421 they write things online that they would never put on real paper
4446422 lori drew is definitely an exception however it is conceivable if someone posts derogatory pictures or writes something that could for example keep someone from getting a job or getting into college that they could be brought to court
4446423 besides apps that are used for e mail and personalized contacts and calendar were seeing some additional traction amongst crm apps sales field service there are also sparks of interest amongst inventory management and logistics apps
4446424 from a features and functionality standpoint on the crm apps organizations arent looking for the applications to do complicated algorithms rather they are looking to the mobile apps to provide field users with more customer related information such as service call information that the customer has asked for in the past and what sorts of things that a customer has purchased before
4446425 previously mobile apps tended to be focused on extending the line of business app like crm or order management
4446426 now the vendors are working on making their solutions plug into other systems easier out of the box capability to enable stronger cross visibility
4446427 besides rim there are windows mobile devices palm devices nokia devices and iphone devices that are being uses for enterprise mobile apps from what ive seen rim and windows mobile support the vast majority of mobile enterprise apps that includes e mail i think the chief strengths of blackberries include versatility and cost blackberry devices can support a variety of enterprise mobile apps on the device and device costs range from 100 200 on average
4446428 the browser is somewhat kludgy compared to the iphones browser it can be difficult to navigate and users sometimes must flywheel down to the bottom of pages to access links or enter data
4446429 i chose to put oss instead of devices because palm offers devices like the treo that operate on the windows platform
4446430 there are constraints for some handheld solutions running on different operating systems
4446431 for example oracle peoplesoft crm has a mobile handheld solution that runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry and microsoft dynamics crm runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry so if youre a buyer running those solutions as your enterprise crm apps and want to extend those capabilities out to blackberry devices that youve already rolled out for e mail you face a challenge
4446432 they offer a software layer that allows organizations to extend their crm application to multiple device types
4446433 devices definitely play a large role in managing the deployment of mobile applications from a developers perspective they must take into account the operating system and capabilities of the phone
4446434 for many developers ensuring their software is supported on many phones can be costly
4446435 sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smart phones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
4446436 even the most current mobile devices still provide a small fraction of the bandwidth screen size and memory available to desktop based applications
4446437 mobile applications must be designed to function well in such a limited environment
4446438 in addition we launched the oracle mobile business indicators to coincide with the launch of the apple app store on july 11th 2008
4446439 highly intuitive and flexible features including browse search and favorites for a superior overall end user experience
4446440 support for key erp business approval processes with rich analytical context
4446441 obviously the american mer rovers spirit and opportunity that were put up by nasa enjoyed an extreme amount of success they were able to travel large distances well beyond their planned lifetimes but were hoping that with our baby well be able to go places that are actually much further
4446442 its quite a tense period for us in astrium and for the other companies involved in building exomars and for all the many many scientists who will depend on this mission
4446443 on the one hand we are moving ahead with a great momentum as youve seen this is not a paper project there is real engineering going on and we are on the verge of building the real hardware that will go on to the planet mars
4446444 but on the other hand we do have a real problem in order to complete the project further funding needs to be made available and it wont be until november that we are sure that that is in place
4446445 the uk will be working with its international partners to try to bring about a mission that has high impact and is affordable in a process of negotiation that will culminate in decisions at the ministerial in november 2008
4446446 as of june nominal home prices declined 10 7 from a year ago
4446447 given our home price expectations for the remainder of this year we expect 2 7 million pre foreclosure and foreclosure filings in 2008 up nearly 50 from 2007
4446448 home prices take years to stabilize in a down cycle but seeing the rate of decrease slow after a year and a half is about in line with what id expect

4446451 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem

4446463 any way you slice it incomes arent keeping up with the inflation rate
4446464 people see it and they feel it on a daily basis
4446465 if its gasoline or food thats visible inflation and the stuff that households need the most and depend on
4446466 72 percent of foreign owned corporations went at least one year without owing taxes and the same was true for 55 percent of domestic corporations
4446467 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
4446468 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls

4446479 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4446480 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4446481 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter
4446482 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
4446483 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
4446484 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
4446485 killing fields in the middle east abandoning the field of battle will force the enemy to bring the war to us to america to our shopping malls to our sports stadia to our buses trains airliners churches synagogues and yes even to our childrens schools
4446486 hey hey ho ho guilt and conscience have gotta go
4446487 when was public virtue to be found when private was not

4446490 we are aggressively attacking the factual errors in this book and making sure that everyone knows about the deeply offensive things corsi has said that will give readers of any political affiliation pause and ample reason to question the lies hes written
4446491 i would strongly encourage republicans not to use the book i think going after someones religion is the lowest form of politics
4446492 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4446493 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4446494 i only pay 400 mo for my insurance thats affordable
4446495 brand new and never before seen locations content and features
4446496 candidates who went on the show raised about 44 percent more money than like candidates who didnt in the 30 days after the show
4446497 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
4446498 the gcs kind of copped out with 35 of them saying they should be equally accountable to the ceo the board and the shareholders
4446499 im not on the ballot but i am very much in this race
4446500 i just wanted to ensure that future candidates did not have doors closed to them as i had on me this is a mass movement which needs to be accepting to all comers now the minute i surrendered my petitions they closed the doors again i had a feeling they would do this but trusted a certain individual democrats had a real opportunity to establish something real and lasting but once again they shoot themselves in the foot i will continue my mission into november people have asked why i didnt attempt to change the rules from the inside well sometimes you stroke a donkey and give it a treat but then there are times like this when you have to grab it by the tail and give it a hard kick in the rear end
4446501 would devastate new yorks health care infrastructure and severely threaten access to care
4446502 in just a few short weeks we have gone from suggestions of shared sacrifice to making hospitals and nursing homes into sacrificial lambs
4446503 half of the money comes out of health care what happens to education
4446504 we support proactive budget balancing by the state but not at the expense of municipal property taxpayers
4446505 legislative leaders were noncommittal monday to patersons plan to cut pork barrel spending
4446506 nothing short of an all out assault on public services and taxpayers throughout new york state csea will not stand by and see our communities undermined
4446507 the governor is right that they need to act now that the deficit is only going to get worse
4446508 but there will be big resistance in the legislature particularly in the assembly
4446509 with the people of georgia and their democratic elected government
4446510 with the people of georgia and their democratic elected government

4446512 i idolize her and she is beautiful i would love to be just like her
4446513 maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
4446514 hes the leading evangelical figure hes trying to craft a new direction a new image for evangelicals the fact that this is happening at saddleback not focus on the family makes it more neutral ground its an audience that both obama and mccain have a real shot at getting
4446515 take up the causes that are politically correct and dont want to take up issues that are controversial
4446516 we thank god for his emphasis but its interesting that the candidates are going to a voice that has been somewhat silent on the great foundational issues of abortion and marriage even though he would stand for those
4446517 we are in danger of losing this whole country to the secularism of europe
4446518 i dont see any conflict at all and if there was i wouldnt be a part of it
4446519 im focused on the same thing rick warren is focused on i think evangelicals must be talking about disease and poverty
4446520 i believe that pastor rick is going to ask a wide range of questions and i believe he will ask questions about issues of life efforts to redefine marriage the importance of family and other issues that are of concern to traditional evangelicals
4446521 i dont know how hard he will press its sort of a new role for him
4446522 using his influence to become the next jerry falwell or james dobson
4446523 if you dont just focus on those two issues if you say there are a variety of issues that ought to be of concern to evangelicals you can plausibly see evangelicals saying obama is better on the first three mccain is better on the last two
4446524 mccain and the republicans need to have evangelicals vote mostly on social issues
4446525 if they do that theyll vote mccain obama is a very strong candidate to appeal to moderate evangelicals he talks about his faith in a compelling way and appeals to them on poverty the environment and the desire for change
4446526 counter my convictions and the convictions of masses of believing americans
4446527 i think the church is in danger of a deception of being courted by senator obama
4446528 this way we will benefit from their financial muscle and they will benefit from our most competitive margins
4446529 we currently have over 150 small medium and big distributors countrywide
4446530 it is an attempt to misuse the coalition arrangement since the cabinet does not address election issues we want to see justice done and the innuendo being brought forward to the effect that pnu was trying to steal the elections is wrong and should stop
4446531 this technique will cut costs and speed up construction times significantly
4446532 in april we met in lebanon with representatives of the state department of transportation dot about the state designation
4446533 all of our state legislators came i was amazed at the number of people interested in this it was standing room only
4446534 ive met so many interested and knowledgeable people in the process
4446535 ive also learned a lot for instance we have obtained documentation from the state that route 78 largely follows what was originally an old indian footpath
4446536 it is believed there are still iron ore deposits on its ridges
4446537 iron ore was one of the natural materials that helped develop this area of the state because it was used by foundries to make cannonballs during the revolutionary war
4446538 greenwich township has actually used this and built it into their master plan
4446539 that can serve to enhance protection of nearby lands when development is being considered
4446540 we have lovely little towns like stewartsville asbury and our own lebanon that people speed by without even knowing they are there
4446541 this grass roots approach ensures a strong local commitment to the promotion and long term preservation of a highway corridor that is officially designated as a scenic byway
4446542 scenic byways promote partnerships between local governments businesses civic groups and community leaders
4446543 it serves to strengthen civic pride and makes communities an even more attractive place to live and work
4446544 it also serves to identify an areas scenic historical and recreational treasures for the enjoyment of future generations

4446546 i won the gold and my world exploded i like to keep myself with my familiar comfort while the attention has been flattering at the same time there is constant glare of scrutiny which i can really do without
4446547 i am so looking forward to being home in my familiar comfort one i have flirted with the idea of donning a disguise and running away from a month till the euphoria passes and life gets to normal unfortunately thats not an option just as of now but hey its fun fantasy
4446548 i know my life is not going to be even close to the same upon return but it is something i am going to have to embrace and actually enjoy which i am at this moment finding way more daunting than shooting
4446549 i spent wonderful moments with the other volunteers we got on well together a lot of fun its worth doing it

4446555 a little dramatic tension at an otherwise over managed convention
4446556 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4446557 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4446558 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4446559 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4446560 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4446561 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4446562 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4446574 cant we just go to that little spot over there
4446575 its going to take more of an effort but i think its possible
4446576 this last meeting was a disaster from the scientific perspective
4446577 mexico and the european union also expressed concern that there are too many new issues of procedure and of a policy nature
4446578 the core of the problem in that these tend to be government nominees not scientists who are up to date with the literature
4446579 or it delivers himself to the russians to be judged or it must die
4446580 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4446581 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4446582 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4446583 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4446584 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4446586 iran just wants to use turkey as a transit country but turkey wants to be a partner iran is concerned about turkey becoming an energy hub

4446610 he thought nothing of this until a short time later he observed four males wearing balaclavas and dark clothing running across his garden and approaching his conservatory door
4446611 they were carrying various weapons an axe a large knife a bat a bar and a pole they approached the conservatory and began to kick it and hit it
4446612 were not in the business of taking licences away just because weve got too many this is a historical thing that has been allowed to build up over the years
4446613 it is a cultural centre and you can see that particularly at this time of the year but if you look around the city there an awful lot of for sale signs up and some pubs are going to the wall so perhaps thats the situation catching up on a few places
4446614 this is good it shows that it is now being taken seriously whereas in the past perhaps it fell under the radar

4446619 in the coming weeks amazon ec2 will be launching a new persistent storage offering
4446620 in summary the policy states that where possible informal settlements will be upgraded in situ ie where settlements are safely located and their location does not compromise the development objectives of the city for example they are not on a servitude required for high priority road development they will be given some form of legal recognition and also physically upgraded
4446621 it is significant that in brazil favelas began as precarious settlements with cardboard and tin dwellings but with an increased sense of permanence and legal security residents upgraded their dwellings and most are now brick and concrete
4446622 the bill doesnt address existing legislation and new acts and ordinances the roles of the different spheres of government are not adequately clarified the role of spatial policy is underplayed environmental management and development planning procedures remain separate
4446623 constitutional principle for provinces to assist facilitate support and strengthen the capacity is confirmed in the bill
4446624 the white paper promised a single piece of enabling legislation with common processes the bill is not clear how the land use management bill will co exist with existing national and provincial legislation
4446625 the city will take an inclusive consultative approach and the dfa provides the mechanism to do this
4446626 the potential to improve the lives of over half a million residents
4446627 as new approaches are being tested here there needs to be acknowledgement that the programme will need to be flexible to accommodate improvements as projects are piloted
4446628 cognisance must also be taken of the capacity within the city notwithstanding a dedicated unit it is important that the programme be well run and achieve its objectives efficiently and should become a best practice approach that other cities can learn from

4446673 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4446674 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4446675 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4446676 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4446677 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4446678 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4446679 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4446681 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4446682 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4446683 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4446684 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4446685 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4446686 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4446690 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4446691 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4446692 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4446693 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4446694 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4446695 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4446696 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4446697 if we replace our windows with newer silverline replacement windows ones our house will be worth up to 25 000 more than it is now
4446698 and it would make a great selling point if we ever decided to sell the house too
4446699 weve lived here a long time and weve been perfectly safe so far
4446700 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4446701 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4446702 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4446703 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4446704 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4446705 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4446706 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4446707 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4446708 if anybody can fly a bucket of bolts through hyperspace he can
4446709 the force can have a strong influence on the weak minded
4446710 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4446711 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4446712 a typical midwestern town mostly white mostly christian mostly red state all the way
4446713 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4446714 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4446715 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4446716 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4446717 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4446718 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4446719 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4446720 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4446721 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4446722 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4446723 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4446724 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4446725 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4446726 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4446727 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4446728 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4446729 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4446730 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4446731 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4446732 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4446733 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4446734 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4446735 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4446736 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4446737 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4446738 health and social services directed toward increasing and maintaining the physical intellectual emotional and social functioning of developmentally delayed individuals including occupational physical and speech therapy assistance training supervision and monitoring in the areas of self care sensory and motor development interpersonal skills communication and socialization and reduction or elimination of maladaptive behavior

4446747 so if you want to see what facebook looked like about three years ago you can go there at the time it literally was just facebook copied in red
4446748 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action their strategy appears to be if you cant beat them sue them
4446749 the first difficulty they run into is studivz is in germany
4446750 so facebook has sued them here on the theory that by logging in to the facebook site they agreed to be subject to suit in california
4446751 because it lets the person who executes the idea best win in the marketplace and that protects a healthy competitive marketplace
4446752 it may look like an easy thing to do but actually growing such a copycat is just as hard as building a company thats otherwise your own original idea

4446776 its no surprise that rising living costs are impacting on peoples propensity to save for retirement what is worrying is the ongoing naivety that we are exhibiting with people accepting that they will be short of funds on retirement but still refusing to plan ahead its a strange juxtaposition that so many of us say we accept that our living standards will decline but still insist on spending our cash on enjoying life now instead of trying to save a little when reality catches up those without retirement funds will be in for a rough ride it will be interesting to see what impact the economic downturn has as people get a taste of being short of funds and realise that its not a comfortable option
4446777 so are they truly studio quality eh if you had a studio you wouldnt put up with the sweepingly uneven amplification you can compensate for it and get some very impressive sound from these ath ck7s rolls off the tongue dont it but then theyre going to be tied to whatever device youve got them plugged into i cant use these with both my media player and my pc because once i switch from my pc speakers i have to reset my equalizer and they would be a total waste if my media player didnt have a multi band customizable equalizer theres no preset in the world that can correct for these babies

4446804 the last torch has more and bigger vent holes than the others so enough air will flow through

4446806 i grew up on the he man cartoon and watched he man six days a week the notion that i think we most took from the cartoon are the characters and trying to find a way that is true to them
4446807 now at the same time we had to come up with why that is the way it is
4446808 the script is very true to the characters were not talking about putting nipples on the trapjaw suit but we had to come up with a reason again why trapjaw would actually not just be something thats totally absurd but why he would need those bionic parts added to him

4446845 additionally we expect to launch other phase ii trials this year in indications which could include binge eating disorder and alcohol dependence as we previously discussed it is likely that catalyst will seek partners for these indications

4446851 our hope is that this gift will increase the chance of survival for students faculty and visitors who may suffer sudden cardiac arrest while at school or attending campus activities
4446852 the presence of these aeds will add another level of safety for everyone in our school buildings students faculty staff parents and members of the community

4446855 with the construction of the first stage of the 50 000 ton per day milling operation well underway and nearing completion and the commissioning stage of the mill facility the loss reflects the increased activity in the construction phase the interest payments made on the notes that were issued to finance the construction and the increased activity by the employees at the mine in gearing up for the commencement of milling operations this fall with the closing of the silver wheaton deal our previous financing and cash flow from operations we ended the quarter with better than 77 million in working capital

4446857 we continued our strong growth during this past quarter our net revenue increased because of strong growth in the sales of non api products robust demand from overseas customers and higher average selling prices for all of our products
4446858 we also used proceeds from our public offering last december to expand our manufacturing capacity acquire a chinese steel and iron manufacturing company and expand our overseas marketing and sales network

4446860 our sales in the second quarter of 2008 rose only slightly and well below our expectations due to severe weather conditions and rising prices that curbed demand for our cellulose ether products
4446861 like many other chinese companies we are facing higher raw materials and energy costs that have put pressure on gross margin as a result we are focused on increasing sales of higher margin products and sales to export markets
4446862 we expect demand for our cellulose ether products to rebound in the second half of the year and we have already seen an uptick in sales volume in july unfortunately we have been forced to limit production due to energy restrictions imposed by the chinese government to avoid power outages during the olympic games once the restrictions have been lifted we plan to increase utilization beyond the current level of 80
4446863 our new biopolysacharride product will begin mass production later this year and is expected to generate gross margins of approximately 65
4446864 a policy or pattern and practice of discrimination against african american applicants for jobs at msg
4446865 intended to place msg on notice of class wide allegations of race discrimination
4446866 the fact is about one in five u s adults has a criminal record and a disproportionate number of them are african americans and hispanics millions of people like ms clarke are motivated to return to the workforce after they pay their debt to society only to be turned away by employers with unfair hiring policies
4446867 this type of discrimination is a worsening problem for workers who have had a brush with the law and has a devastating effect on low income communities nationwide and particularly on minority communities

4446870 our second quarter results reflect the strength of our position in the chinese high end chestnut market during the quarter we enhanced our distribution network by transitioning to agents rather than selling through wholesalers or directly to retailers and increased our number of counters in supermarkets to 500
4446871 our recent contract win with yum china division clearly demonstrates the strength of our distribution network and we look forward to further improving our network in the coming months
4446872 during the second half of 2008 we will focus on branding our chestnut products for the domestic market due to our marketing efforts and improved distribution network domestic sales of chestnut products are expected to increase by 50 during this year we are also seeing tremendous growth potential from our markets in europe and expect exports to these countries to double in 2008
4446873 we continue to expand our product offerings particularly in the convenience foods segment
4446874 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4446875 todays results demonstrate our continued emphasis on operational performance while maintaining our focus on integration activities building operational capacity and delivering a high quality of service to our customers
4446876 strategically the company is where we wanted to be at this point in the year
4446877 our integration efforts continue at a rapid pace our team is coming together and were creating an operational platform that will enable us to continue to be the preferred communications provider to the communities we serve
4446878 we are now positioned to be the leading end to end service provider to the deaf and hard of hearing community
4446879 the additions of sla and vli diversify our revenue and service offerings but equally important they strengthen our position as the employer of choice offering interpreters who join our company greater diversity in the practice of the profession
4446880 we are very pleased with the exceptional growth reflected in our second quarter results particularly the increase in our wind related revenue as we execute on our long term strategy to seek to become a leading component supplier to the wind power industry in china net revenue generated from the forging of rolled rings for the wind power and other industries accounted for 4 1 million or 36 5 of net revenues during the quarter in the first half of the year revenue from the sale of forged rolled rings to the wind power industry accounted for 2 6 million whereas one year ago we were in the start up phase of this business
4446881 our new manufacturing facility is scheduled to come online in october 2008 and will allow us to manufacture essential wind power components internally including larger forged rolled rings gear rims flanges and shafts
4446882 we expect to produce prototypes of our forged products for potential wind power customers in september 2008 and hope to secure sizable contracts upon successful inspection and acceptance of our prototype products
4446883 based on our 12 years of experience in manufacturing industrial equipment we believe we have the technical expertise to meet the high standards required by our potential customers we are confident that we have the strategy in place to take advantage of the wind power equipment market in china which industry analysts expects to reach usd8 59 billion in three years

4446887 there are a lot of interesting players in the market that bar a have the chance to sign arshavin is one of them but these things are in the air still
4446888 the team will be competitive whatever happens i have no doubt about that
4446889 in the champions league qualifier it was complicated and demanding i value that because i know how difficult it was and besides we have not yet qualified we still have to travel to poland
4446890 ive already said that i dont really fancy opening the season against a highly motivated newcomer like k ln for me they are the more mature of all the promoted sides and i dont think theyll have any problems this season
4446891 we need to watch out for their counter attacks but we will be positive and we wont start with a loss like we did last year
4446892 chievo feel that sergio is indispensable even if the player would love to play for a big team like lazio

4446900 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4446901 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4446902 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4446903 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4446904 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4446905 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4446906 i want to keep improving be successful and win more things hopefully that will drive us on to more success this season it is harder in the sense that all the other teams have improved and are getting better
4446907 weve been champions two years on the spin and are even more of a scalp so teams are really up for it we managed to overcome that challenge last season and that success drives you on
4446908 i think we will improve this season as well as other teams and its who can do it over the course of a season
4446909 weve managed to do it the past couple of years and its the test to do it again
4446910 the big clubs are always going to be in there towards the end of the season and it is really tough

4447092 a one year up tick does not necessarily mean the progress has ceased but at the same time the increase is significant enough to warrant concern for years the national campaign has celebrated the yearly decline in the teen rates but has also warned that good news can lead to complacency each year a new group of young people turns 13 and the need to retain a steady intense focus on preventing teen pregnancy remains we have also noted many times that even with the wonderful declines of the last 15 years the united states still has the highest rate of teen pregnancy and birth in the developed world perhaps todays numbers will encourage a greater more intense concentration nationwide on teens over the next several months our group and others will be trying to tease out what might account for todays news an important aspect of this work will be to recognize that birth rates went up last year not only for teens but also for women in their 20s 30s and 40s it will also be important to learn more about how these broad changes in the us birth rate might have been affected by the abortion rate public investments in education and services behavioral changes state variations and more as well
4447093 every child deserves a warm welcome and we hope that jamie lynn spears new daughter maddie briann will be surrounded by much love support and comfort but the media frenzy that is sure to now erupt as it did when this pregnancy was announced last december provides every parent teacher media outlet and more a chance to state the truth babies need and deserve adult parents who are committed to each other and to decades of being the best parents possible hundreds of thousands of teens and unmarried young adults get pregnant and become parents every single year and few of them have hollywood beginnings or endings getting pregnant and bearing children is one of the most important steps that any person ever takes and it deserves careful planning thought and consideration
4447094 the continued decline in the nations rate of teen pregnancy is good news but not unqualified good news
4447095 the teen pregnancy rate for hispanic teens increased slightly between 2003 and 2004 and for the first time hispanic teens now have the highest rates of both teen pregnancy and births also data released in december 2007 show a 3 increase in the teen birth rate between 2005 and 2006 the first increase in the teen birth rate in 15 years inasmuch as teen birth data serve as a general marker for trends in teen pregnancy data our celebration of todays good news may very well be short lived we continue to encourage policymakers practitioners parents and others to intensify their efforts on preventing too early pregnancy and parenthood
4447096 teen pregnancy and birth rates have declined by about one third since the early 1990s a remarkable success story
4447097 even so it is still the case that one in three girls in the united states get pregnant by age 20 given the nations stubbornly high rate of teen pregnancy it is most welcome news that the menu of proven research based interventions that help young people make better decisions about sex pregnancy and parenthood is expanding
4447098 i was so surprised because i just saw the contest and entered for the heck of it i hope people will see my video and think about how they should enjoy life right now while they are young i hope it makes them want to wait until they are older and have a plan
4447099 so often we dont ask teens what they think one thing the videos make clear is that young people have a lot to say about how they view their lives now and by extension how their lives might change if they became pregnant or caused a pregnancy i hope that lauras funny video gets the myspace generation and young people everywhere thinking and talking about the consequences of teen pregnancy
4447100 after 15 years of steady decline the teen birth rate increased slightly between 2005 and 2006
4447101 clearly a renewed focus on preventing teen pregnancy is needed and we hope that in some modest way the quiz will help teens think carefully about sex and contraception the possibility of pregnancy and the lifelong challenges of being a parent

4447266 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4447267 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4447268 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil

4447276 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content

4447306 unfortunately russia has tended to view the spread of freedom and democracy as opposed to its interests bush said today in a statement outside the oval office before heading to his texas ranch for vacation

4447309 she will bring me up to date on what she has seen and heard in georgia as well as paris said bush
4447310 some americans listening today may wonder why events taking place in a small country half way around the world matter to the united states bush said
4447311 georgia has become a democracy since the rose revolution the georgian people have held free elections georgia has sent troops to afghanistan and iraq to help others achieve the liberty they have obtained

4447320 in 2006 there was a similar campaign to the current one in brazil in argentina
4447321 the presence of hcg in various samples of the vaccine used against rubella were discovered the suspicion that brought about the investigation was caused by the fact that there were very few cases of the disease in argentina which didnt merit a large scale campaign
4447322 the age of the people who will be vaccinated is 12 to 49 years for women reproductive age and between 12 and 39 for men
4447323 the ages for women are the same as those who received the vaccines in nicaragua where they included a hormone that sterilizes the woman who receives it and similar to the age of those who received another sterilizing hormone in the philippines
4447324 if the campaign goal is really to eliminate rubella then why vaccinate those already vaccinated
4447325 why compel the vaccination of those that had the illness in the past it is a fact more than proven that an individual who has had rubella in the past will never have it again
4447326 we woke up at 12 55 this morning to this almighty thundering noise we thought it was someone breaking in went downstairs and saw people outside it was total carnage the car had hit the kerb and ploughed into the fence taking out a concrete fence post and hitting the caravan
4447327 i told the fire brigade there were two gas bottles in the caravan so they doused everything down with water when they got into the car they turned round and said theyre both dead and everything slowed down at that point its a terrible way to go
4447328 i was speaking to two lads who were crossing the road seconds before they saw the car come screeching round the corner hit one kerb and then another lose control and then it must have blown a tyre as it hit our kerb and took off clearing the shrubbery before hitting the caravan it must have been some impact because there are parts of the car in the back garden a brake disc i think
4447329 it punched the caravan into the shed buckling the floor and the sheds hit the greenhouse my wifes fiestas a write off as well from the side impact my son has slept in that caravan before when weve had guests in the spare room ive mixed emotions this morning itll take a few days to get over obviously i feel for the two lads and their families
4447330 the investigation into the exact circumstances of this collision will continue but at this stage it is not believed that any other vehicle was involved nobody else was injured in the collision
4447331 we made the vehicle safe and then extricated the males we were guided by the paramedics as to how far we went
4447332 they were both caring lads both top lads who look after their mates just good lads and its a terrible shame whats happened and the way theyve gone
4447333 its got right through to everyone they say they wont be speeding any more it was just a crazy moment i was with him a few minutes before and he nipped out with one of his mates

4447376 we want to express on behalf of the community around where this occurred and also on behalf of the victim and the doctor our utter outrage how low can somebody sink to have committed such a crime
4447377 vehicle crime per se is bad enough anybody who has their car interfered with will think that is bad enough its despicable in itself but this is just plumbing new depths
4447378 it was obvious an accident had taken place at the scene it would have been obvious to a blind man on a galloping horse that the person who had left the car was tending to someone who was involved in a road traffic accident but then to get in the car and steal it words really do fail me that someone can have such a lack of human decency to steal a car in these circumstances
4447379 what kind of mentality do some people have why would you want to do such a thing its sick
4447380 we are trying to sign players both overseas and in england but we are not close to getting any more new players at the moment
4447381 after signing half back jeremy smith from south sydney rabbitohs last week the priority now is to bring in outside backs
4447382 as well as paul sculthorpe newspapers have been linking us with three other saints in francis meli steven tyrer and willie talau
4447383 there is nothing in the meli story i cant see us digging a player like him out of a club that is likely to win things
4447384 tyrer is contracted to st helens so hes simply not available
4447385 as for bannister signing a new deal im delighted with that hes done very well for us this year
4447386 hes a very good player with a lot more in him hes only 20 but hes already proven he can make the step up to super league having played there for harlequins and st helens
4447387 i may rest a few front rowers but i will not be making any more than two changes
4447388 batley still have a mathematical chance of making the play offs and they only lost to second placed halifax on the final play of the game on sunday so they are obviously playing well and i expect them to have a real go at us itll be a tougher test than our last game with dewsbury and i dont want our form dropping with the play offs just around the corner

4447400 uitm sahaja yang kita orang melayu ada untuk dibanggakan kita seharusnya berusaha untuk mempertahankan apa yang kita miliki bukan menjahanamkannya pula
4447401 kami kesal menteri besar berbangsa melayu ini sanggup bertindak sebagai ejen pihak lain dalam usaha menghapuskan hak istimewa orang melayu dan bumiputera di universiti ini
4447402 kami berharap isu kuota bukan bumiputera untuk masuk ke uitm sebagai pelajar tidak perlu dibincangkan lagi kami kesal abdul khalid membelakangkan hak kaum sendiri
4447403 abdul khalid cuba membuka ruang kepada bukan bumiputera mencerobohi institut pengajian tinggi yang ditubuhkan kerajaan untuk golongan bumiputera
4447404 sebagai penuntut uitm kami kesal kerana tindakan menteri besar selangor tersebut seolah olah cuba merampas hak kaum melayu sekiranya perlu diwujudkan persaingan kenapa tidak diadakan antara 20 buah universiti yang terdapat di negara ini
4447405 kami kesal kerana kenyataan orang terpelajar seperti abdul khalid itu bukan sahaja mencerminkan beliau tidak peka dengan maruah bangsanya sendiri malah tindakannya itu seolah olah cuba menjahanamkan maruah bangsa melayu
4447406 saya bukan orang politik tetapi sebagai penjaga universiti ini saya berasa kecil hati dan marah kalau ya pun cakap biarlah berbudi bahasa dan berhemah sikit kalau bercakap biar fikir betul betul jangan cakap sesuka hati kutuk dan hina kaum sendiri seolah olah kaum melayu ini sangat teruk
4447407 ia tidak patut keluar daripada mulut seorang pemimpin melayu walaupun sebelum ini ada pemimpin bukan melayu bercakap mengenainya ia dibuat secara berhemah dan tidak menyakiti hati orang lain

4447409 status tanah sengketa yang diklaim tni au memang tercatat di lanud atang sanjaya bogor tetapi penguasaan lahan hanya diberikan untuk hak guna pakai
4447410 dalam posisi seperti ini pemkab kabupaten sukabumi tidak punya kewenangan untuk menentukan siapa yang paling berhak atas tanah tersebut sehingga kami menyerahkan sepenuhnya kepada pemerintah pusat
4447411 bahkan kami mempersilahkan tni au untuk menempuh proses jalur hukum melalui pengadilan tetapi tawaran itu tidak pernah digubris hingga muncul sengketa tanah yang terus berlarut larut
4447412 bahkan masyarakat maupun tni au mau menghormati keputusan rapat muspida untuk tidak melakukan kegiatan di lahan sengketa

4447427 untuk mengurangi subsidi bbm dan listrik pemerintah sedang menggiatkan penggunaan sumber energi alternatif di luar bbm termasuk mempercepat pembangunan listrik non bbm dan pengembangan biofuel

4447433 itu memang sudah menjadi amanah undang undang sekarang ini bagaimana pemerintah dapat merealisasikan anggaran pendidikan 20 persen itu demi kemajuan pendidikan di indonesia
4447434 mudah mudah anggaran pendidikan sebesar 20 persen itu dapat terealisasi karena pemerintah telah mengurangi berbagai subsidi untuk itu

4447441 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
4447442 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

4447445 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
4447446 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
4447447 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
4447448 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
4447449 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
4447450 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
4447451 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
4447452 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
4447453 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
4447454 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
4447455 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
4447456 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
4447457 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
4447458 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

4447479 it took the red army excuse me the russian army only two days to secure abkhazia and south ossetia
4447480 by crossing georgias borders the russians have committed their worst violation of international law since the invasion of afghanistan in 1979
4447481 at a time like this it is vital for the leaders of the west to stand together and make clear that this aggression will not stand
4447482 likewise the russian attacks on georgia if left unchecked could easily trigger more conflict in the future the kremlin has embarked on a campaign to destabilize not just pro western georgia but other former soviet satrapies that refuse to toe its line many of these states have their own russian minorities whose alleged maltreatment provides the perfect excuse for russian meddling today georgia tomorrow ukraine the day after estonia
4447483 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule
4447484 incidentally has russia really been helping much on iran it has gone along with while delaying three united nations security council resolutions that have imposed mild sanctions on iran but it has also supplied material for irans nuclear program and is now selling iran antiaircraft systems to protect military and nuclear installations
4447485 objective is the finlandization of georgia through the removal of president mikheil saakashvili and his replacement by a russian puppet
4447486 subduing georgia has an additional effect it warns russias former baltic and east european satellites what happens if you get too close to the west it is the first step to re establishing russian hegemony in the region

4447489 exomars remains a high strategic priority for the uk no decisions about levels of support for instruments have yet been made
4447490 indeed these cannot be made until the scale of the mission and the exact complement of instruments is decided by esa and this will depend fundamentally on the decisions that the esa council ministerial make on the scope and funding envelope of the project
4447491 theres been talk of having races between the three of them but we havent done it yet

4447496 the market is gigantic because of the legislative agenda in the us
4447497 whether or not that gives them something unique probably not there are other people out there with similar types of microbe but tmo probably has more of an advanced position in terms of demonstration scale up
4447498 its something were looking to rectify weve conceded a couple of sloppy goals which were working on to try to get right for tomorrow
4447499 we dont want to have to be scoring three goals to win it would be great to get one goal and keep a clean sheet with any new signings youre going to need time to settle in and thats maybe the case
4447500 theres maybe a slight lack of concentration from a couple of players at key times that have cost us goals
4447501 the gaffer wanted to keep the back five pretty much the same to try to establish a link between us that will be good for us in the long run
4447502 were still learning and getting to know each others games you cant just expect it to click straight away were restricting teams to one or two chances but through our own errors theyre scoring from them
4447503 its not the midfield or the strikers fault its just thats whats happening
4447504 im buzzing to get going ive heard a lot about the wolves fans and ive experienced it myself coming to the games
4447505 i cant wait to get out in front of a massive crowd to see what theyve got for us

4447518 there was an overwhelming response to the wcdi campaign countrywide with more women heeding to the call and standing as candidates in the 2008 harmonised elections
4447519 now that the groundwork has been done in terms of mobilising women to become active members in political processes the onus is now on us as women to stand as one and believe that we are capable and effective leaders
4447520 let us put aside our differences for the purposes of engaging in a constructive dialogue of reviewing our experiences and designing a clear way forward that will enable us to achieve greater successes in the next elections
4447521 it is not an issue of who is pulling who down its an issue of contesting for power which you should fight for
4447522 he died with his boots on after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle
4447523 it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma
4447524 it begins with a plan a plan to build a plan to put hard working americans first barack obama hell put the middle class ahead of corporate interests to grow the economy end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas help businesses that create jobs here invest in education cut taxes for working families and make energy independence an urgent national priority
4447525 the faith community in the united states is going to be paying a lot of attention to this event
4447526 mccain just doesnt appear comfortable talking about his faith thats why this event is so important to him
4447527 how effective will he be in cashing in on the opportunity
4447528 hes at least got the ear of a large number of religious voters
4447529 who voted for bush but are not happy about it
4447530 they keep talking about things like abortion and yet nothing ever happens
4447531 we dont have any illusions that were going to take 50 percent of the evangelical vote but i do believe that were going to make real inroads into the evangelical community because we think that barack obama lives what he talks
4447532 an ideal opportunity for barack to speak to a young evangelical community who is frankly more tolerant and truly interested in a united country and doing the kind of good works that are in the new testament
4447533 theres no question that the man has faith the question is what kind of faith
4447534 you can say youre a christian but then you cant go and support abortion and same sex marriage
4447535 the only evangelicals who are going to vote for obama are the ones who have never read their bible
4447536 to see this much movement from a voting population that was allegedly certain of who they were going to vote for is pretty unusual
4447537 at the same time centrists and conservative leaning voters are reconsidering obama the most conservative christian voters are distancing themselves from
4447538 its just wacky people just arent sold on either one of these guys theyre just waiting for somebody to give the right signal
4447539 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4447540 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4447541 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4447542 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4447543 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4447544 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4447545 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4447546 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4447547 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4447548 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4447549 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4447550 i think evangelical voters are going to be harder to get as a bloc of voters this time
4447551 it seems like were observing a movement toward the middle and away from the far right extreme
4447552 when you bring together thousands of people in one congregation youre going to have all kinds of racial and economic diversity that brings with it political diversity than when you have a congregation of 100
4447553 these evangelicals are concerned not only with abortion and marriage but with poverty the environment and human rights
4447554 mccain isnt liberal on social or moral issues but he hasnt made that the centerpiece of what hes about as a candidate
4447555 i dont concur with the fact that john mccain is a moderate republican
4447556 john mccain is a conservative john mccain was voting pro life before it became in vogue for republicans to vote pro life
4447557 if sen obama is serious about making abortion safe and legal but rare and he presents a clear committed plan to make abortion rare he will be much more attractive to evangelicals
4447558 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4447559 meine ersten gedanken waren dass das eine rennstrecke ist auf der wir noch nie gefahren sind berall sind streckenbegrenzungen ich denke die ganze formel 1 ist sehr gespannt auf valencia

4447561 the companys gross margin in the second quarter was affected by the tremendous increase in commodity prices increases in container shipping prices from china and the devaluation of the us dollar versus the chinese rmb this trend now seems to be reversing itself as commodity prices have dropped from their highs in may june by an average of 20 the us dollar is showing strength and stabilizing against the chinese currency the price of oil has dropped significantly and we are hopeful that shipping expenses will stabilize or be reduced
4447562 sales for the first six months came in about where we expected we were disappointed in the decrease in gross margins in the second quarter but that situation seems to be at a minimum stabilizing the company continues to be successful at introducing new products as evidenced by its new fireplace accessory line that will begin shipping to wal mart in the third quarter and by the addition of household cleaning items although these items do not have the gross margins of our gun cleaning items they offer an opportunity for tremendous growth at reasonable and profitable gross margins
4447563 the company still projects sales in the third and fourth quarters combined to be between 11 000 000 and 13 000 000 a big contributing factor being the shipment of our fireplace accessories the company has also received a commitment of almost 1 000 000 on a holiday promotion with wal mart we expect annual sales for 2008 of between 16 000 000 and 18 000 000 and net profits between eleven and thirteen cents per share the company continues to tightly control expenses and improve its strong financial condition as evidenced by current assets of 5 62 million and current liabilities of only 1 55 million a current ration of 3 6 to 1 and shareholder equity of 4 757 145 the company will continue to develop new products and in fact has been asked to work on a significant amount of new household cleaning items for 2008

4447616 it was a beautiful thing to watch all those people lift up that bus
4447617 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4447618 to protect the fundamental freedoms and rights essential to the preservation of american society
4447619 women obtain abortions for different reasons at different times of gestation via differing medical procedures and within different personal social economic and cultural contexts all of these may lead to variability in womens psychological reactions following abortion
4447620 consequently global statements about the psychological impact of abortion on women can be misleading
4447621 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4447622 help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives
4447623 i would agree that more research needs to be done because psychiatrists are not asking women with mental issues if they have had abortions
4447624 right now the abortion recovery movement is somewhat of a self help movement
4447625 psychological associations are denying the pain rather than asking women about it and theyre denying it i believe for ideological reasons
4447626 a lot of risk factors for having an abortion and subsequent problems which abortionists do not currently reveal to the women
4447627 this raises a new standard of abortion malpractice in america because even the apa admits that if you have risk factors like prior sexual abuse or low self esteem you are at risk for abortion related trauma
4447628 by the apas own admission then almost all abortionists in america are committing malpractice because they do not check for those factors before performing the abortion
4447629 there may be conflicting studies but its a lie to say there are no studies which show harm from abortion
4447630 some were perfectly happy straight a students with no history of family trauma
4447631 then they had the abortion and began a destructive cycle
4447632 i was a straight a college student and had an abortion during junior year of college
4447633 they said you never have to tell anyone so i never told about my abortion
4447634 even when i went to the doctor i never admitted i was pregnant or had had an abortion
4447635 they couldnt understand why i had the breakdown they gave me medication but it wasnt doing anything
4447636 one thing i didnt understand is that it was actually a human being
4447637 i was told it was just a lump of tissue one of the things that opened my eyes was seeing pictures of fetal development
4447638 i thought i was the only woman when i first started dealing with my abortion experience
4447639 now ive come to find out that there are many women that have the same grief depression and loss issues

4447649 its not one of our key worries for the rating at this stage
4447650 we are more worried about the current account deficit rising external debt levels and inflation
4447651 but if you had escalation or even if a small clash simply prompted capital flight then that would have a negative effect conflict would certainly be negative but that is not something we see as very likely at this stage
4447652 if inflation stays at these levels in quite high double figures then that would add to risks to the macroeconomy and possibly prompt negative ratings action
4447653 but if the price of gas to ukraine did suddenly increased to the same price for european gas exports from russia the economy would struggle to cope

4447657 everything tends to indicate that the privilege of the assumption was explicitly revealed to the apostles and that it was transmitted subsequently by the oral tradition of the liturgy
4447658 the political social and religious atmosphere in the middle of the twentieth century influenced greatly the decision of the pope
4447659 mindful of the human misery caused by war of the ever present threat of materialism and the decline of moral life and of the internal problems that disturbed the church he turned to mary confident of her intercession
4447660 believed that calling attention to the bodily assumption of mary would remind all men and women that the human body is sacred that the whole person is holy and destined to live forever
4447661 it is true that no human life is exempt from faults only the immaculate virgin presents herself pure before the divine majesty since she loves us and knows our weakness what have we to fear

4447664 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
4447665 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy

4447667 our taxpayer dollars went to pay people to infiltrate and take notes on our meetings and its absolutely enraging a lot of this homeland security funding is an absolute sham its being used to actually crush dissent not to keep us safer in any real way

4447683 theyve demanded alpen corn flakes weetabix whatever they can get hold of
4447684 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
4447685 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
4447686 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
4447687 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4447688 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
4447689 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
4447690 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
4447691 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
4447692 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
4447693 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
4447694 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
4447695 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
4447696 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
4447697 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
4447698 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
4447699 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
4447700 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
4447701 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
4447702 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
4447703 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
4447704 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
4447705 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
4447706 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
4447707 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
4447708 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
4447709 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
4447710 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
4447711 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
4447712 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these re russia invades province of georgia after georgia attacks russians videos
4447713 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4447714 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4447715 information is no longer a staff function but an operational one it is deadly as well as useful
4447716 russia is an aggressor we are a small democratic country please help us
4447717 if the russians stop hostilities now they will have redrawn the whole strategic situation in the caucasus to the detriment of the americans
4447718 no one will invest in georgia in oil pipelines in new ventures there now the game is over in the new version of the great game the russians can cash in
4447719 at the moment it appears that russia will have gotten positive benefits from the use of force across its border
4447720 for medvedev the outcome is a war thats been won its his personal victory
4447721 the image of medvedev is the biggest casualty we and the west were hoping that russia at last had a young liberal reforming leader now after these events he comes off looking like a tough guy and there is an impression that hes totally dependent on putin
4447722 this moment could well mark the end of an era in europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
4447723 while no one wants a return to cold war style confrontation moscows behavior poses a direct challenge to european and international order
4447724 a russia that has the means of force and is ready to use it spells a whole new situation
4447725 all neighboring countries will have to take this into account much depends on how russia behaves if it tries to dictate terms that will have a very negative effect but my impression is that russia was quite restrained and carefully calculated each move it seems likely that nato will be paralyzed
4447726 meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4447727 we saw them arriving in the capital south ossetia has become a symbol of a powerful russia a russia that seems to be expanding its territory
4447728 theres no gas no electricity no water in the city
4447729 its all because of our leadership its not our fault but were the ones who suffer
4447730 were expecting humanitarian help from tbilisi like bread and sugar
4447731 the people who sit in their armchairs maybe they want it but we dont want it
4447732 we expect the united states to adopt a responsible approach it is especially important to refrain from any steps that could directly or indirectly be taken by the georgian leadership as encouragement of its revanchist ambitions and prompt a repeated tragic scenario
4447733 bush is speaking about georgia live not bigfoot country the other one

4447757 most people who play xbox live arcade games dont generally agree with the mainstream reviews that are written about these games
4447758 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
4447759 zenit have decided to reduce the asking price for andrei but by exactly how much i cannot say because the negotiations were led by zenit president alexander dyukov
4447760 real madrid president ramon calderon was very polite with us
4447761 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4447762 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4447763 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100million he was very emphatic
4447764 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4447765 i think we are close to doing something with robbie
4447766 ive said all along that he has to get his fitness and sharpness and we are now seeing good signs of that

4447776 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
4447777 he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
4447778 nobody is better suited to make those decisions concerning national security than john mccain
4447779 surprised them by saying i like both candidates very much
4447780 he has the personal qualities to grow into the job
4447781 in so einer fr hen phase aufgekauft zu werden beweist uns wirklich dass wir an einer wirklich hei en sache dran sind
4447782 the role of english as our common tongue must be protected this
4447783 it is set to be one of the most mind blowing spectacles ever
4447784 our campaign was based on the slogan vocal advocacy which calls for transparency publicity and exposure of our institution we feel we have to be vocal and assertive
4447785 the management has been slow in responding to situations and only does so when the situation is about to get out of control
4447786 hes sick hes got an addiction he needs treatment hes sick you know there is treatment for this kind of addiction a lot of men have gone through the treatment with a lot of success but he wont do it because he is in denial
4447787 if obama wins he will win by a landslide margin if mccain wins it will be a very small margin
4447788 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4447789 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4447790 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4447791 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4447792 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4447793 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4447794 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4447795 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4447796 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team im a big fan of valencia as a city its a beautiful location and hopefully the race will bring a lot of new fans to formula one
4447797 i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia
4447798 its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4447799 with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4447800 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4447801 a new track always opens up the field and gives an opportunity for the driver to make an impact as our feedback will be very important in achieving the correct set up
4447802 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points
4447803 we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team im a big fan of valencia as a city its a beautiful location and hopefully the race will bring a lot of new fans to formula one
4447804 valencia is going to be a medium to low downforce track with a couple of quick corners which will present a very challenging circuit in an exciting environment
4447805 right now im very confident that this is the guy we were after all along
4447806 this is one of those cases that never went away for some of us
4447807 the effects are no doubt still fresh in the minds of those victims and we hope that news of this arrest will help them in their continued recovery
4447808 it feels satisfying that at least we know that the victims can have some kind of closure that they dont have to look over their shoulder to wonder if hes still out there
4447809 only properties which are in the public interest may be expropriated for public purpose when the bill becomes law not all properties will be expropriated
4447810 it appears as if the unconstitutionality and the draconian nature of the proposed expropriation bill have dawned upon the policy makers and responsible members of the governing party in parliament
4447811 rather than adopting this ill conceived and unnecessary bill the government should instead enter into serious negotiations with organised agriculture and other affected interests to reach agreement on a land reform process that will be just and equitable non divisive effective economically acceptable expeditious and agriculturally sustainable
4447812 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4447813 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4447814 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4447815 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4447816 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4447817 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4447818 the role of english as our common tongue must be protected this
4447819 we are gathering data right now from all over the district
4447820 what happens is when we enter the names of those individuals that participated in the elections whats posted on their record is simply that they participated in the election and if they voted in a primary or if they vote in a general election
4447821 the role of english as our common tongue must be protected this
4447822 we anticipate continued growth in traffic numbers but our forecasts indicate a slowdown in the next 18 months leading up to the 2010 fifa world cup
4447823 the demand for airline seats declined by an estimated 3 1 in the last quarter of the financial year
4447824 the domestic passenger sector was supported by a strong low cost carrier sector
4447825 im sympathetic because were all the whole country in this climate
4447826 growth was particularly strong in our property parking retail car hire and advertising businesses
4447827 but even with our capital expenditure up 214 9 we still managed to make a profit and maximise traffic
4447828 we have a great growing business there russia but the more i read about investments in russia the less i like the feel of it
4447829 the growth in india is really extraordinary and we will be doing more and more there with all the talk of international downturn even the gloomy indian economists are still forecasting gdp growth in the coming year of at least 7 per cent
4447830 as we look at the year ahead we anticipate an increasingly difficult economic environment the escalating price of energy the contraction of real estate values and liquidity and confidence issues in the finance sector are creating economic shocks that will likely be felt by the vast majority of consumers in the us as well as in europe and maybe elsewhere
4447831 all of our newspapers have a complementary commercial strategy exploiting the display space of print and re purposing content for the web so the inventory can be re sold newspaper companies willing to invest in new forms of delivery which have a commitment to quality will prosper
4447832 in europe the sydney games will be occurring mostly during the early morning hours yet europeans are used to getting up early for such events and the ratings are surprisingly high if europeans can get up in the very early morning to watch their favorite athletes live then why cant americans
4447833 i cannot count that somebody will try to solve the subscription problem taking into account eu and polish law the european commission must be notified of the new regulations the whole process will last a dozen months while the new law should come into force in january instead of developing tvp i will have to make up for the giant loss in the budget amounting to pln 300 million 93 5 million ill be working like a dog to repair all this
4447834 overall half a glass of red wine a day increases your risk of breast cancer by 10 if their figures are correct alcohol causes about 6 of all breast cancer in the uk meaning 2 500 cases a year
4447835 with no discernible politics save an attachment to her class no reporting and frequently no clue a perpetual font of beltway conventional wisdom uncomplicated by any collision with messy reality
4447836 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
4447837 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
4447838 i think its going to be a case that the fec is going to have to take seriously
4447839 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
4447840 het is natuurlijk al een vogelrijk gebied zeker met het haringvliet zo vlakbij maar meer mag altijd
4447841 ik heb geen flauw idee waar bernisse ligt mompelden een paar aanwezigen volgens projectleider ed klein moest de oplossing zo ver van de krimpenerwaard worden gezocht omdat er dichterbij geen mogelijkheden voor waren
4447842 bij voorkeur wordt natuur zo dichtbij mogelijk gecompenseerd maar we beseffen dat het niet altijd kan dan is compensatie elders beter dan niets aldus een woordvoerder
4447843 versnippering moet zoveel mogelijk voorkomen worden zegt marjolein buijssen van milieudefensie
4447844 dus we pleiten ervoor die compensatie zoveel mogelijk in de omgeving te realiseren
4447845 in de eerste plaats zijn we fel tegen het bouwen van een woonwijk op deze plek zegt secretaris piet van montfort
4447846 maar om het verdwijnen van het unieke landschap hier te compenseren met een paar hectare aan de andere kant van de provincie is onvoorstelbaar
4447847 i think the author himself said it might be a bit barmy it is barmy
4447848 i gather hes off to australia the sooner he gets on the ship the better
4447849 conservative policy is focused on the good work of continuing the resurgence of cities across the north of england
4447850 if these half wits are advising david cameron then god help us if we ever get another conservative government
4447851 its been too long since we beat the united states
4447852 its the biggest rivalry in baseball and its fun playing in an atmosphere like that
4447853 theres nothing wrong with hard baseball but to take out a second baseman is uncalled for
4447854 im a proponent of playing hardball but not throwing at a guy who was squared away to sacrifice bunt
4447855 its not a good idea as pitchers were just trying to get batters out
4447856 am anfang war ich in der kurve immer zu schnell aber das auto hat gute bremsen
4447857 bored at work and need some shit to pass the time by
4447858 im not looking for any new job im running for re election
4447859 if i was bi lingual id say no in multiple languages the only job john kerry is running for contemplating or considering is the one he already has
4447860 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4447861 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4447862 im keen to ensure that the pct keep to their promise that this review really will be
4447863 i simply dont accept that because current services arent in line with national guidance we should automatically change what weve got here
4447864 however it is right that we should sit down and look at all the options and the priority must be to ensure that we maintain the best cancer services possible for the people of bath
4447865 residents across bath know that their streets are unsafe at current speeds and are joining our twenty is plenty campaign
4447866 i was delighted that three liberal democrat councillors visited portsmouth where this scheme has been implemented they have found out valuable information and perhaps most importantly that the scheme is so popular people want it
4447867 parents no longer feel safe letting their children out to play and residents are increasingly sick of rat run drivers the council needs to understand that these zones arent just needed next to schools they need to be across the majority of our residential roads currently it seems as though there needs be a serious accident before the conservative council is prepared to even look at the issue we deserve better than that
4447868 the liberal democrats have been campaigning on this for our area and so far we have met with a stone wall from the conservatives what portsmouth has shown that this is easy to implement and is popular
4447869 while the narrow victorian streets of portsmouth lend themselves particularly well to the lower limit there are still numerous roads in our authority where 20mph limits would be sensible
4447870 whatever mistakes tbilisi has made they cannot justify russias actions
4447871 no country can take unilateral action regarding the caspian sea
4447872 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
4447873 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
4447874 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
4447875 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
4447876 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
4447877 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
4447878 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
4447879 these sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape as they were carefully placed to be viewed being close to the road and at the time raised above the ground
4447880 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
4447881 beeldspraak werd vroeger omgezet in gewoon taalgebruik 25 jaar geleden werd gedacht dat doven metaforen niet konden begrijpen
4447882 well support the film and hope it translates into more book sales
4447883 about having more control in the process typically publishers tend to stick their heads in the sand after the book hits hollywood
4447884 based on an assurance from the gotham group that it has hollywood potential
4447885 the big incentive for publishers is hoping to sell books now theyre going into this and there is already planted the notion of film and television and some other form of media and the two go hand in hand
4447886 whereas random is confinancing films with focus s amp s will not be investing money in production instead because the house controls the material the deal pertains only to works that s amp s has the film rights for it will share the revenue with gotham and in a symbiotic relationship with gotham s amp s will also turn certain projects from gotham into books
4447887 is one reason why the partnership with gotham is resting in simon amp schusters childrens division
4447888 centered on two children who work for an old tabloid that covers the world of freaks and aliens i always liked the idea of playing with the idea of transformation and alien nature and freak nature i just want it to be really fun and really funny and be really original
4447889 it was almost like a tool to get the book launched and off the ground i knew also that financially this is where i would see my benefit in having the film made

4447896 i am tired there arent reasons for everything in the world
4447897 here is a question if you can find the answer in my heart i will change my mind lets say i love a flower at a mountain cliff and we are both sure that picking the flower will cause death will you still do it for me
4447898 dear i would not pick that flower for you but please allow me to

4447902 were pumped to bring exciting updates on the upcoming open world mafia game the godfather ii weve got some great exclusive looks at eas star wars the force unleashed
4447903 most people who play xbox live arcade games dont generally agree with the mainstream reviews that are written about these games
4447904 electronic mail and internet users have no expectation of privacy in the to from addresses of their messages or the ip addresses of the websites they visit because they should know that this information is provided to and used by service providers for the specific purpose of directing the routing of information
4447905 most internet users today do not know that their browsing information may be tracked aggregated and sold
4447906 the practice that has been described to us whereby an isp may enter into an agreement with an advertising network to copy and analyze the traffic content of the isps customers poses serious questions under the federal wiretap act
4447907 congress got a glimpse into how chemicals are regulated in this country and saw how broken the system is
4447908 the phthalate ban is only the tip of the iceberg of whats needed to protect americans from unsafe chemical exposures
4447909 public health advocates and parents were up against big oil and the chemical industry and we won this should serve as a wake up call to industry chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects have no place in consumer products
4447910 consumers are saying that the products we buy must be safe period the phthalate ban is a great start and an indication that congress is ready to consider the kind of sweeping chemical policy reform that is needed
4447911 we took a very business like approach to the race
4447912 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1000 metres we owned it
4447913 we probably relaxed just a bit more than we should have in the last 500 metres it would have been nice to finish first in the semi but were in the final and thats important
4447914 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
4447915 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
4447916 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4447917 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4447918 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4447919 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4447920 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4447921 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4447922 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4447923 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4447924 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4447925 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4447926 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4447927 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4447928 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4447929 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4447930 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4447931 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4447932 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4447933 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4447934 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4447935 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease
4447936 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4447937 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4447938 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4447939 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4447940 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4447941 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4447942 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4447943 design is the engine that can transform a company into a powerhouse of nonstop innovation

4447961 its been a long time since a swimmer has been a poster child of the olympics like this
4447962 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4447963 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4447964 its what everybody talks about when they come into the pool
4447965 weve talked about the relay where we beat france and how far michael phelps torpedoes under the water doing dolphin kicks when the rest of the swimmers are already above water and hes still down there looking up at them it just makes people more excited about swimming especially the young ones who are just learning
4447966 i just learned how to dive off the side and im practicing diving off the blocks now
4447967 this year i started to become fast and sometimes when im in a good mood and a happy mood and a confident mood i try to swim fast and good like michael phelps
4447968 usually id be out doing other things playing sports with friends or going to see a movie
4447969 but ive been staying in to watch the olympics just to see michael
4447970 i dont want someone to tell me the next day what happened i want to experience it first
4447971 to know someone just going to the olympics is so absolutely incredible and exciting but this is just hard to explain its so motivational and hes just so michael
4447972 i think the visual of seeing so much excitement about swimming combined with higher summer temperatures it makes people think about having a pool

4448022 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest us support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and can not cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime

4448030 we meet at the table of the world to play the great role playing game that is life new characters appear as others fade into the background each participants passing from the table leaves only a memory and an empty chair as the focus of the campaign shifts from drama to low comedy to horror it is our duty to keep playing until the one day the grief of being surrounded by so many empty chairs forces us to bow out as well

4448049 perhaps it is just as well that the musical genre is dead
4448050 it isnt dead people go to see musicals all the time
4448051 this musical genre is not dead in fact it can be pretty inventive have any of you seen sweeney todd
4448052 howard the duck you have the soundtrack to howard the duck my god man and by the way musicals are corny
4448053 even worse musicals are stupid i mean how can you believe in a world where people just break into a song about how the sun is shining
4448054 this from a man that believes the ninja jiraiya was a real person
4448055 he was a folk legend they said he could turn himself into a toad theres no proof

4448061 you sure youre ok man you look a little off
4448062 what oh well our adventure begins in the world of greyhawk your characters are all veterans of the fourth great war against the orc empire an army made up of forces from the human and dwarven empires were able to drive back the orc forces but the elves chose to remain neutral this terrible war has left the economy of greyhawk in a shambles crime and poverty are rampant
4448063 is it safe for my fighter to walk around at night should he hire a bodyguard
4448064 an interesting campaign world but what is the dragon to halfling ratio
4448065 you know what a war means hot refugee chicks hot refugee chicks willing to do anything for a warm blanket and a crust of bread
4448066 my character deals with his post traumatic stress by putting porridge up his nose on moonlit nights
4448067 your characters are in a local tavern waiting for an old man who has promised you a map to the location of an ancient treasure
4448068 my character has invented the monofilament blade a thousand years early
4448069 i beg your pardon but i must abscond to the rest room please continue without me and please consider that my character is an eager participant in all that the party does
4448070 since hes up for whatever we do lets kill his character
4448071 are we here to play or screw with each other
4448072 dont ask questions like that you wont like the answer
4448073 you all sit around in the tavern discussing your ambitions and backstories then you see him an old man eating a modest meal and watching you intently
4448074 the old man gets unsteadily to his feet and hobbles over to you you can see he has a long white beard and a blue wizards cap he asks are you the legion of virtue
4448075 i hide under the table in case he is a wight in disguise
4448076 he says i have heard that you are noble warriors eager for adventure and gold
4448077 my cleric explains that he goes where his god tells him
4448078 the old man says i have need of such heroes for a great undertaking
4448079 my wizardess runs her hands provocatively up and down her staff
4448080 shhh i want to hear where hes going with this
4448081 the old man explains that the tomb is full of all the gold and jewels you could ever want and all he needs in return is an object at the heart of the dungeon the xenon codex a crystal spellbook that
4448082 we relieve the old man of the map we dont need no stinkin quest we can just keep all the treasure for ourselves
4448083 cutting out the middleman i like it unless of course youre having a threesome
4448084 outraged the bouncers descend on you other people are screaming for the town guard
4448085 we make our way to the forest and camp in the woods we send old yellowbelly out to gather some firewood
4448086 alone maybe we should all go together theres safety in numbers you know
4448087 just go if we hear bloodcurdling screams well probably send weasly to save you
4448088 well how about that maybe running the old man through wasnt such a good idea after all
4448089 fine i just say we keep on pillaging and looting
4448090 guys we have a whole scenario ahead of us here i didnt work two days on a game world for you guys just to engage in pointless random violence
4448091 were chaotic neutral thats practically a get out of plot developments free card
4448092 no im going to put my foot down on this one
4448093 blobert what the hell happened there do you need to go to the hospital
4448094 this is merely a symptom of my passion for all things culinary
4448095 you mean your diabetes arent you taking care of it
4448096 i am meeting the enemy head on i will not curb my appetites for the sake of a genetic discrepancy i will not go gently into that good diet
4448097 death is not to be feared it is simply a saving throw that grows more difficult with the passing of time
4448098 i think perhaps i over indulged on the good generals chicken dish before i came here you see i have been forced to go to the chinese buffet because i have been banned from the golden corral for life
4448099 let me only say that if eating macaroni and cheese directly from the steam trays is wrong than i have no desire to ever be right
4448100 i tell you what why dont you head down back to the table and ill clean up in here somehow
4448101 please do not tell the others of this i am something of a role model to them
4448102 are you sure you dont need to go to the hospital
4448103 does he really need to know all hes going to do is his foofy poetry stuff
4448104 no i can do it you get organized for the tomb
4448105 so we fought past the bouncers the city guard and the mob we raided all the local merchants and found a magic shop to could rob once the town was in ruins we took a glance at the map then we saw it was in gnomish and we said what is this crap we dont want maps with gnome codes all we want is gold quick but the dm has screwed us because he acts like a prick so well just wander through the campaign world finding stuff we can take cause when youre chaotic neutral you can act like a flake if you crave jewels and adventure and can shrug off some pain if dont fear the undead if your bloodlust wont wane if you want bags of gold and silver weve a mission to take because peasants cant fight back in their boots they will quake
4448106 yes we like jewels and adventure only just on our terms but we wont fight no dragons and we hate purple worms so well just wander through the campaign world because were pcs in an game and can do what we all like no dm can complain
4448107 so thats what happened a fairly standard campaign opening for us really what town shall we raid next
4448108 anyway i am not running a game where you run around like a bunch of kill happy lunatics
4448109 no in fact the god boccob appears before you and says that for your crimes you must go to the tomb of shartok the unattractive and retrieve the xenon codex if not he will destroy you and the world utterly
4448110 now let me get this straight weve got the god boccob ticked off at us
4448111 for the last time yes and he transports you all into the dungeon
4448112 my character is more than eager to take up the quest shall we establish a marching order
4448113 nothing ever begins there is no first moment no single word or place from which this or any other story springs
4448114 i i think well how did they get up there on those dice
4448115 i require more soda where is the bottle of rc cola
4448116 you know ive always wondered how come none of you guys like mountain dew
4448117 no i mean that literally stinks do you ever change your underwear
4448118 sadly the washing of my loins has become a torturous experience at best
4448119 now how many pairs of pants has this been for you
4448120 the tearing in my breeches says it all ive split my pants and i feel the fabric pulling from my thighs ive split my pants and there will soon be a draft upon on my ass because ive split my pants again for cookies and pies to me are like crack i said ive split my pants again
4448121 there are no goth shops in big and tall i said ive split my pants again soon all ill have to wear is overalls and slacks i said ive split my pants again and i got banned from jenny craig for bringing snacks ive split my pants again and ive lost the zipper right off of my fly i said ive split my pants ive split my pants again ive split my pants ive split my pants again ive split my pants
4448122 well the doctor pleads with me to slow my pace and sees ive split my pants again because my waistline conspires to give my heart the shakes i split my pants again but i cant stay on a diet when there are cakes thats why i split my pants again and i will never choose a salad over the grave you see ive split my pants ive split my pants again ive split my pants ive split my pants again ive split my pants
4448123 oh oh it must be gas yeah i must have gas
4448124 youre sweaty trembling and your eyes are bugging out i havent seen you look like this since the year they canceled doctor who
4448125 they did not cancel doctor who they turned it into a novel range so they could tell stories that were too broad and deep for the small screen
4448126 sure sure i think you had all just discovered a group of bugbears living in the dungeon apparently they broke through of one the tomb walls and started nesting here there are dozens of them
4448127 more than we can handle in a straight up fight maybe we should go around them
4448128 ok ive got an idea my wizardess and the fighter with the soiled armor will scout ahead and try and find a way through
4448129 trust me i know what im doing hey ab3 i bet you never thought those items i insisted my character bring along would come in handy
4448130 pray in one hand and wait for androgynous fairies to dance in the other see which fills faster
4448131 thats not how that never mind what is this plan
4448132 fine then her only great skill aside from magic is making bear costumes now she carries two of them with her at all times one is for special occasions but i think that in this case shell make an exception
4448133 so we put on the bear costumes to try and fool the bugbears into thinking were part of the pack
4448134 either your character does this or my ninja gets his murder on
4448135 several of the male bugbears approach you while the females stay back guarding the young
4448136 just stay down yellowbelly try to make yourself as small and unthreatening as possible
4448137 now i think what happens next will cause a reaction or morale roll
4448138 i am either quivering with anticipation or i am going to pass out again
4448139 do we wait for them to get close and then attack
4448140 no just have your fighter be as still as you can
4448141 my wizardess mounts old yellowbellys character and starts humping him
4448142 make a reaction roll for them they might just think we are a couple of fellow bugbears getting it on
4448143 whoa wait a minute here i think the spellcaster should be protected over the ninja a ninja can just get out of the way of danger
4448144 yes but the ninja can kill the cleric if he doesnt do the smart thing
4448145 my character takes the blood from his wounds and the bugbear smegma from yellowbellys befouled bear costume and paints an ankh upon his face to appease his god
4448146 maybe we should save it until someone is closer to deaths door
4448147 my character has three hit points left that is deaths welcome mat
4448148 what my fighter is a critical part of the team
4448149 well it is ultimately your characters decision weasly but my wizardess can make it very worth your while two words prismatic spray
4448150 i dont know what to do i was kinda saving that last heal for myself
4448151 cast heal cast heal cast heal cure wounds cure wounds cure wounds oh cleric my fighter may not survive owww cleric im slashed from stem to sternum my guts are churnin and cleric my saving throws i have failed my torsos impaled my flesh flailed my limbs have lost all feeling i need clerical healing clerical healing oh save me helps me to stay alive please reset my spine clerical healing baby is good for me clerical healing is something thats good for me
4448152 whenever my blood pressure is dropping and my entrails are piled up around my feet there is nothing i can do i can crawl across the floor and cry help baby cleric i know from deaths door youll retrieve me the magic you use will uncleave me if youre out of ill be squealing i cant live without it its clerical healing cast heal cast heal cast heal cast heal raise my hits tonight cure wounds cure wounds cure wounds cure wounds before the next fight
4448153 cleric i got jumped while scouting there was no warning so i could flee cleric adventure was my bounty not for some bugbear to mount me and when my flesh is peeling i need clerical healing clerical healing is good for me you can restore my eye and fix my tush some say it restores the hymen but theres some debate clerical healing baby its good for me clerical healing is something thats good for me
4448154 and its good for me and its so good to me
4448155 i have seen that look many times before it is a look of profound revelation i saw that look once before when i answered the door for the ups man in a robe that was far far too short
4448156 are you sure that was what it was are you really
4448157 i came here to play a ninja not watch ab3 drool and stare at his dice
4448158 put on my black hood mask and unsheathed my blade ill bring death and badassitude to the middle of your lamest game ninja overlords wont you look down over me cause i plan to kill my way through anyone so much looks at me well im playing a ninja playing a fighter with death to deal playing a ninja and before no man do ninjas yield
4448159 the dm tried to bone us with some pit fiends in a room drew my katana and backflipped in and those monsters i waded through now the dungeon master had forgotten with my ninja theres a rule he cant feel deaths sting when he wears his magic ring it gives armor class 2 well im playing a ninja playing a warrior with death to deal playing a ninja and before no man do ninjas yield
4448160 ive got family that hates me my credits beyond repair theres no bed that i can sleep in because i keep gaming supplies there so im gonna play a ninja and i role play whenever im able id do it for a living if i could even with that ab3 there his smugness can be withstood he thinks he knows gaming but his role playing is shite he says do you think a ninja would do that
4448161 well im playing a ninja playing a fighter with death to deal playing a ninja and before no man do ninjas yield well im playing a ninja playing a fighter with death to deal playing a ninja and before no man do ninjas yield
4448162 nothing ever begins there is no first moment no single word or place from which this or any other story springs
4448163 perhaps his left brain has come into perfect synchronization with his right and now illusion and reality have become as inseparable as the art of boris vallejo and ass shots
4448164 you know that analogy would have worked just as well with peter north
4448165 no im ok i just need a minute to get my head together here im im just more tired out than i thought i guess
4448166 i heard what you said do you mind explaining it to me
4448167 it means we are all laughing at you because of your girlfriend
4448168 well your eyes do have kind of a moony look to them
4448169 well that really isnt it we saw you and her at lake george
4448170 what the hell were you knuckleheads doing at lake george
4448171 and the big arcade still has that old star trek video game you can sit down in you know the one with the buttons on one side and the dials on another they have crazy climber too
4448172 while they engage in such shenanigans i take several buggy rides and imagine to myself i am mycroft holmes preparing to capture jack the ripper and win a blood pudding eating contest in one fell swoop truly the best fan fiction is the fan fiction we carry in the secret places of our heart
4448173 dont forget the place that sells these pewter dragon figurines i love
4448174 so while we were there we happened to stumble upon you and your chubby little secret
4448175 look hes being an ass about this i admit but i have to ask what the hell are you doing
4448176 yeah a fat girl you know who else goes out with fat girls germans and homosexuals
4448177 i guess love is cheaper by the pound is that right ab3
4448178 thats not funny and its not nice say what you want about me but leave her alone
4448179 i think what your fellow gamers are trying to say is that we do not understand why you have suddenly chosen to take this strange and unnatural path
4448180 my girth is a sign of epicurean experience and my wealth women see me as a man of experience and deep thought when a girl is large however that is a sign of weak character it warns of slothfulness and a lack of impulse control
4448181 women always put on weight when theyre in a relationship this girl already has weight to spare stick around too long and theyll be taking off the side of her house to load her into a flatbed truck to take her to the hospital
4448182 look i dont mean to be mean but you know how it is the hotness of the girl you end up with is a symbol of how well youve succeeded in life if you end up with a model it means youve got it going on if you end up with a plain jane it means youre middle management a fat girl ab3 thats trailer park man
4448183 oh fuck you fuck all of you i like this girl i like her a lot i might even be in love with her do my feelings mean anything to you guys
4448184 look im not saying you cant bang this girl fat girls are wild in bed because they dont know when theyre gonna get it again but you were holding hands wither her man there were public displays of affection
4448185 i thought it was hysterical the great ab3 has given up on love pretty soon youll quit on the writing thing and just start giving out your stories for free to strangers
4448186 look i would take your so called advice a little more seriously if not for the fact everyone but yellowbelly and i have had sex with the same flipper armed girl
4448187 look asenath isnt just some flipper armed big breasted double jointed canadian girl with no gag reflex whatsoever shes a gamer
4448188 oh no dont you idiots start singing we are going to have this out

4448196 look i just dont want to hear you guys bad mouth her anymore is that so much to ask
4448197 will that make you feel better well just be making jokes about you behind your back then just like everyone else that sees you with her
4448198 maybe other people will see her for the great fun to be around person she is and not do that
4448199 yeah a microcosm of what the outside world is like
4448200 maybe not maybe im an ok guy with an ok girl
4448201 maybe its just you guys maybe you guys just dont see who i really am maybe you just see what you want to see
4448202 come on now we only took one semester of philosophy
4448203 im done i may be done for a long time
4448204 bullshit we came here for a game not to hear you snivel and bellyache shut up and make with the d amp d
4448205 no i cant this is really the last straw you guys dont have the slightest respect for me as a person anymore much less for any game i might be trying to run
4448206 all this because we called you out as a chubby chaser
4448207 its more than that i should be gaming with friends not adversaries i mean if im going to spend an entire saturday night gaming then shouldnt i be enjoying myself and why are there elves singing in my pants
4448208 i respect what you have to say especially the part about the elves
4448209 holy crap youre serious youre just gonna kick us out in the middle of game that sucks and you suck you suck on levels science has yet to understand

4448300 multiple instances of allen providing at stevens request things of value to benefit two of stevens children and one of stevens grandchildren
4448301 communications between stevens and a personal friend that demonstrates stevens consciousness of guilt
4448302 under the name and for the benefit of theodore and catherine stevens
4448303 although stevens knowingly carried debt on a 31 000 interest free loan from a personal friend for more than 10 months during 2001 stevens did not list such a liability on his 2001 financial disclosure form
4448304 allen offered to get stevens daughter a new car in exchange for the 1999 land rover and stevens agreed
4448305 although the 1999 land rover transaction was between allen and stevens the 2005 automobile transaction occurred instead between stevens daughter and a veco employee for the purposes of hiding allens involvement in the transaction

4448310 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington dc but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4448311 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4448312 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4448313 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4448314 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation will enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4448315 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
4448316 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
4448317 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
4448318 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life
4448319 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4448320 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4448321 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4448322 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4448323 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4448324 he has indicated he is not a rich man and cant live abroad
4448325 we hope that in the interest of the good of pakistan and for the good of the country that mr musharraf takes the right course and resigns before the impeachment process begins
4448326 official action has to be taken by him and he has not yet taken the action
4448327 the vast majority of the u s government has moved beyond their original attachment to musharraf
4448328 if i may be so bold there was another president
4448329 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4448330 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4448331 thats lower than the level of taxes when ronald reagan was president
4448332 this relocation affects the moral fabric of the west side
4448333 a decision to put a facility of this nature so close to our local schools should involve the community and im doing what i can to ensure they have a say in the makeup of their neighborhood

4448340 i have this recollection of somebody asking me for lawyers in new york and i remember naming three or four and he must have been one of them it was either her who called or somebody on her behalf
4448341 i remember getting a call from pam and her telling me that she was representing him i may have sent him over there but on the other hand i may not have i dont have an accurate recollection
4448342 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to the both of them
4448343 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
4448344 we have changed our view and think the dollar has bottomed
4448345 until the end of the year the road may remain bumpy but the underlying picture has turned much more dollar positive
4448346 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4448347 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
4448348 which sum shall bear interest at the rate of 11 a year
4448349 but these linux ones are a whole new ball game
4448350 it must have been a good deal as they had sold out of no text found for this product
4448351 i am excited and looking forward to the new season i feel that this is the one that will make or break me ive been in the psl for two seasons now so i know what its about and there are no more excuses
4448352 and the bafana coach joel santana looks like a man that will reward players if they do well thus far he has stuck with two regular goalkeepers so i want to excel
4448353 the experience that i have gained as a player is not sufficient so i need to uplift myself by also doing coaching courses but it would be more relevant for me to do those courses while i am in a coaching job
4448354 i have more to offer as a coach than if i continue as a player my body might still be in shape but inside i can feel that i cannot match the standards of professional football anymore
4448355 we inspected the pitch last week and it was not up to scratch its not playable the safety of the players and spectators is at risk
4448356 the stadium doesnt meet a lot of the criteria its an old stadium we accept that but at least it has to meet our minimum requirements
4448357 they told us they will start working at it soon and we will look at it as soon as they finish but we dont guarantee anything we have already told moroka swallows that they will have to host the game
4448358 they stated that the pitch is uneven that there are holes and indentations in the field and that the field needs to be top dressed and levelled

4448363 eine digitale ausstrahlung w rde beim derzeitigen stand des ausbaus der digitalisierung nur knapp 40 prozent der tv haushalte abdecken von einer angemessenen verbraucherbeteiligung kann allein schon deswegen nicht die rede sein
4448364 eine erste zinssenkung erwarten erst dann wenn die inflation nachhaltig f llt und die kernteuerung stabil bleibt also kaum vor dem kommenden fr hjahr
4448365 eine zinssenkung anfang 2009 ist sicherlich m glich aber es bedarf sehr berzeugender beweise f r die ezb dass der abschwung in der eurozone tiefgreifend ist bevor sie einen geldpolitischen kurswechsel einleitet
4448366 wenn ich telefonieren muss muss ich mich immer stark konzentrieren die richtigen zahlen auf dem telefon zu tippen
4448367 mir konnte bisher niemand erkl ren weshalb die zahlen auf der 10er tastatur eines computers anders angeordnet werden
4448368 das ist also historisch bedingt damals hatten telefone noch w hlscheiben warum bei den tastentelefonen sp ter eine andere ziffernreihenfolge gew hlt wurde entzieht sich unserer kenntnis
4448369 ursache f r die reihenfolge der belegung der telefontasten war die damalige technologie beim w hlen der einzelnen ziffern durch die drehw hlscheibe am telefon
4448370 erst als auch die mechanischen rechenmaschinen durch elektrische und elektronische ersetzt wurden erkannte man die unterschiede beider tastaturen
4448371 die hersteller von rechenmaschinen argumentierten dass sie soundso viele tausend ger te im feld h tten das gleiche argument brachten auch die telefongesellschaften vor

4448374 the other rowers have a lot of experience with some having competed at the international level for as many as 10 years lidaywa has only competed for three years and we are happy with his progress despite the results here
4448375 my chest was congested and i felt bad very bad
4448376 but i did not want to complain before the fight because it would have demoralised a lot of people i chose to fight on
4448377 he was the stronger fighter but i controlled the fight and was surprised i was not scoring
4448378 the officiating here is quite intimidating and im not surprised that almost all the african boxers have fallen by the wayside

4448382 if arusei keeps the same shape as she did when she ran the 30 57 in the netherlands then im confident she will definitely be among the top six
4448383 it will be a very difficult race because we have world champion turinesh dibaba in there along with the two former kenyan dutch girls lornah kiplagat and hilda kibet and of course lucy kabuu is also very strong
4448384 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4448385 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4448386 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4448387 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4448388 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4448389 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4448390 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4448391 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4448392 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4448393 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4448394 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4448395 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4448396 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe

4448414 i dont know that theres any one of us even a national network thats going to be able to set an agenda for public media weve now given voice to anyone that has an internet connection
4448415 you can nominally distribute something by throwing it on youtube but making sure someone finds it requires techniques that are beyond the capabilities of many individual content producers so there is still a role of an aggregator

4448420 if you dont get this right pretty soon the quality of democracy will decline and stagnate and it will be our fault
4448421 in france we lost the culture of the bike after the war when it was seen as old fashioned or for poor people
4448422 now its coming back and with the latest increase in gasoline prices we are seeing enormous interest
4448423 the chinese bikes are less than half the price of italian ones and clearly that makes a difference to a lot of people
4448424 how does it work do you need to pedal are they very expensive
4448425 we are assuming that the current weakness in the economy will be significant and sustained

4448439 in trying to get an rfid program off the ground youre working with an emerging technology so you want to go in step wise fashion with buy ins from many cross functional project teams in your company
4448440 the case for rfid is it an authentication solution or a track and trace tool
4448441 the problem of counterfeiting has gotten so out of hand that china executed the head of its fda
4448442 from our manufacturers perspective public health is the issue patient safety and brand integrity so we use packaging and rfid as a way to address the problem through serialization and track and trace technology
4448443 the point i want to make is when a person takes a pill in the safety of his or her home is he or she really assured that the drug is authentic i think the answer is no
4448444 if youre an adr you can say you bought drugs directly from the manufacturer and start a new paper pedigree the prescription drug marketing act of 1988 has a loophole big enough to drive a truck through
4448445 so far so good gen 2 technology means the process for making the tags has been simplified and made more robust we no longer have the availability and lead time problems we had with the first round of rfid technology
4448446 we see a good degree of interoperability between the readers and tags based on the uhf gen 2 standard what you need to build a critical mass solution is a standards based system
4448447 were not quite there yet at the item level were single sourcing our tags so theres a little vulnerability there for us now but i expect well be moving to a backup tag supply soon
4448448 can we sustain packaging and distribution center cycle times we experienced some degredation early on which was centered mostly around rework but its vastly improved after the first couple of months following some tweaking its no longer a capacity restraint for us were running where we need to be in our distribution center and on our packaging line
4448449 we are now trying to build our pedigree platform on top of the serialization data carrier concept we have in place we have a way to extract data and send it to our downstream channel partners in an interoperable fashion thats where were going
4448450 we manufacture a product and put an electronic code on it that serves as a unique indentifier we ship it to the wholesaler after we send them an advance shipping notice there is a digital signature so it can electronically indicate that it has received the product there is no paper pedigree that can be torn up with a new one started at each step theres an electronic or digital signature that allows us to take the secondary wholesaler or diverter out of the equation this technology prevents the introduction of counterfeit goods into legitimate commerce and thats the objective a pedigree and track and trace technology
4448451 at this point were making an association between the parent case and children bottles storing that in a database thats what we call our commissioning event for the bottles as theyre being born with a license plate
4448452 at this point weve tagged more than two million bottles
4448453 were seeing performance rates of 99 983 percent in terms of tags that have performed post packaging one of the things i attribute that to is a good qa process at our label converter which identifies and rejects any bad tags before we ever see them the performance range is acceptable but no bad tags go out the door if an rfid tag doesnt read properly it goes through a rework process so that 100 percent of the bottles go out with readable rfid tags
4448454 there are plenty of vendors out there making tags in various form factors the same with equipment we conducted preliminary qualification studies tested our packaging and ran it through both our labs and vendor labs to gather some readings on what our potential success might be we narrowed the field coordinated vendors for additional testing and put together protocols ours was not an out of the box solution
4448455 we excitedly waited for our first set of rfid labels to arrive in our packaging department
4448456 the supplier backed down on the tensioner and sent us another set of label rollstock with the rfid tags embedded this second set looked great but as our engineer moved the web to the packaging line the entire roll unwound like the worlds largest paper telescope that was two down like the story with the three bears the third time the supplier got the web tensioning just right
4448457 we had to make decisions early on at some risk as to choosing technologies that we felt the industry would accept
4448458 we had some experience already because of the wal mart initiative so we decided to move forward with rfid though we are looking at 2d bar coding as a redundant feature because a lot of our industry partners view it as a more reachable interim solution
4448459 we use gen 2 rfid with oxycontin bottles and cases and we use a linear bar code on pallets
4448460 were starting to see an acceptance and preference from our major wholesalers for an rfid based solution as a company moving thousands of cases of product through its doors every day and tens of thousands of bottles we prefer rfid
4448461 is because it doesnt require a line of sight technology

4448477 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4448478 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4448479 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4448480 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4448481 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4448497 matthew young small nitpick here i know very few theists who accept their belief on blind faith they do so based on evidence that is not quantifiable or substantiated by an outside observer but that is not blind faith or faith alone regardless of the validity or your perception of the validity of the evidence that backs up our faith few if any of us believe by faith alone

4448508 these things youve invented should be used according to the moral teachings of jesus
4448509 we must uphold basic human rights regardless of what neuroscience says about how our minds work
4448510 there are very good empirically based reasons why we should uphold things like human rights based around successful functioning of large groups of social animals with a common social contract

4448533 i sometimes feel angry with lyrics and just go with the flow
4448534 i feel an overwhelming sense of satisfaction when i finish writing a song writing is difficult but i am always challenged to do my best sometimes i feel like songwriting should be called song rewriting because i spend a lot of time rewriting until the song is right

4448587 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4448588 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4448589 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4448590 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4448591 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4448592 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4448608 deze aanbestedingsprocedure is illustratief voor elk nieuw te bouwen prominent openbaar gebouw in nederland
4448609 het zijn nu eens niet de europese regels die het probleem zijn maar de angstige manier waarop nederlandse opdrachtgevers die interpreteren
4448610 de bedoeling van die europese aanbesteding was juist om de markt voor meer architecten open te gooien juist ook voor kleine en beginnende bureaus nu gebeurt het tegenovergestelde gemeenten zijn bang te worden teruggefloten en gaan van de weeromstuit op safe spelen
4448611 je krijgt alleen maar grote bureaus die steeds maar hetzelfde doen door dit risico mijdende gedrag worden verrassende idee n a priori uitgesloten en krijgen jonge en kleine bureaus geen kans te laten zien wat ze kunnen terwijl nederland juist met zijn architectuur furore heeft gemaakt door open te staan voor nieuw talent
4448612 het gaat om een opdracht van 90 miljoen dan is het logisch dat we met een bureau in zee willen dat heeft bewezen dit aan te kunnen
4448613 maar die discussie moeten ze niet met de opdrachtgever voeren maar met europa
4448614 een mooi gebouw hoeft niet per se duur te zijn dit budget is toereikend voor hoogwaardige architectuur je kunt niet beweren dat wij hiermee het vak van de architect uithollen
4448615 de prijzen van grondstoffen zijn zo omhooggegaan en personeel is zo schaars dat het oorspronkelijke budget niet meer toereikend is

4448677 we believe it would be difficult for adecco to improve this offer and justify it to its own shareholders there is likely to be short term speculation as to whether adecco will turn its attention to hays or robert walters we would not bank on this given that adecco appeared to be most interested in michael pages brand exposure to permanent recruitment and specialist model
4448678 given the shares were trading below 250p only five weeks ago the decision by management to reject a 400p cash offer is very brave either they are very upbeat on the outlook for trading or are confident that adecco will return to the table our concern is that adecco may shy away from making a higher offer which may struggle to generate a satisfactory return and face shareholder opposition at this stage in the cycle

4448700 hopefully it will be enough for us to get through the first hurdle against newcastle
4448701 its always a good exciting game and theyve never been any difficult they always come and have a go
4448702 weve a good variety of midfielders and the back four are all fit so theres no issues with that itll be the foundation if we defend properly and play our football we do create chances and we will start taking them

4448719 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4448720 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4448721 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4448844 i am sure katy would love fairbanks but a lot of her family is still in the czech republic and her parents are going to be in australia so we have to factor in traveling to see her family
4448845 when i got on the plane to head home from that visit i felt like something was missing because alaska just felt like home right away
4448846 uaf had everything that fit my expectations for a great team my teammates felt like family to me and that is one of the most important aspects of the sport

4448940 the remarkable success of berkshire hathaway is nearly wholly attributable to two men
4448941 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline
4448942 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do
4448943 they absolutely want to protect that tv audience but youve got to give them credit because they are streaming a ton of stuff online
4448944 pumping the video quality up to olympic levels is a hurdle nbc can and surely will work to overcome in time for the next olympics two years from now
4448945 but if nbc had failed it could have set the industry back years

4448959 the whole training camp was supposed to be a disaster the high performance programme was no good there was too much training being done all a load of pony

4448961 if youre going to score and not get them theres a chance of being overturned here kenny landed shots very cleanly in the second round i think everyone in the stadium saw them except the five guys sitting down around the ring
4448962 or at least three of them didnt see it at the same time anyway but it is worrying because it was 2 1 at that stage landing five clean shots and not getting them can break your heart
4448963 if i throw a good punch and nothing happens you can hear a bit of cursing and thats in your head if youre after landing a punch and its not coming up on the screen

4448977 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4448978 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4448979 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4449260 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
4449261 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
4449262 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
4449263 scientists have calculated that it nf3 has a half life in the atmosphere of 550 years
4449264 needless to say no one should be throwing away their flat screen tvs because of this its not in the use of the tv that causes a problem
4449265 now if there was only a way to make sure the story underneath was accurate
4449266 how can those species be under threat when they have survived much higher levels of co2 in geological past
4449267 forming an amorphous silicon nitride a sin deposited film n supplying raw material gas examples are nitrogen n2 ammonia nh3 hydrazine h2 nnh2 hydrogen azide hn3 and ammonium azide nh4 n3
4449268 if the chemical industry had developed organobromine compounds instead of the cfcs then without any preparedness we would have been faced with a catastrophic ozone hole everywhere and at all seasons during the 1970s probably before the atmospheric chemists had developed the necessary knowledge to identify the problem and the appropriate techniques for the necessary critical measurements noting that nobody had given any thought to the atmospheric consequences of the release of cl or br before 1974 i can only conclude that mankind has been extremely lucky that cl activation can only occur under very special circumstances this shows that we should always be on our guard for the potential consequences of the release of new products into the environment
4449269 how can those species be under threat when they have survived
4449270 then the shallow ocean would degas to follow along raising ph
4449271 dear mr zeebe i read sciencedailys report on your work following up from a link on realclimate org i understand the implications of ocean acidification but it is the first time that i have seen easily understandable numbers what interests me are your forecasts for ph changes by 2050 on the usual global warming scenarios it wasnt clear from science dailys report what the basis for your upper range forecast of 0 35 is i have posted a question to mr schmidt on the realclimate site but i wondered if it would help if you or one of your colleagues could yourselves post further explanatory information best regards and dont weaken eachran
4449272 well the earth has experienced periods of non equilibrium in the past so whats wrong if it isnt in equilibrium now
4449273 nf3 is used as a chamber cleaning gas in the manufacture of semiconductors flat panel displays and other electronic devices when compared with competing products nf3 offers customers significant reductions in emissions throughput increases of up to 30 longer chamber life and faster clean rates nitrogen trifluoride is also used in the plasma and thermal cleaning of cvd reactors while it is used as a source of fluorine radicals for plasma etching of polysilicon silicon nitride tungsten silicide and tungsten for example although semiconductors remain the principal driver for electronic specialty gases increased interest in photovoltaics is adding to the push electronic gases are needed in thin film deposition such as chemical vapour deposition cvd or physical vapour deposition pvd technologies used to make a semiconductor or a photovoltaic cell the three major gases used in semiconductors liquid crystal displays lcds and photovoltaics are nitrogen trifluoride nf3 silane sih4 and ammonia demand for electronic gases in the semiconductor and solar cell industries continues to outpace global gdp growth by more than two times in traditional semiconductor segments such as microchips and flat panel displays market researchers expect sales growth of around 8 per year between now and 2010 and for the solar segment the annual forecast lies at around 30 experts anticipate that from 2012 photovoltaic producers will spend more on gases than flat screen manufacturers and from 2017 they are even set to overtake the chip sector although only a handful of different gases are used in solar cell manufacturing in comparison with more than 20 for semiconductors the volumes required are significantly greater
4449274 this identical co2 carbonic acid bicarbonate carbonate equilibrium maintains the homeostatic ph in our blood ph 7 4 a relic of our evolutionary deep oceanic past
4449275 this is a newly recognized pathway of methane formation that needs to be incorporated into our thinking of global climate
4449276 the atmosphere holds 760 gigatons of co2 man emits about 6 gigatons of co2
4449277 the total emissions from all sources are about 200 gigatons and each year there is a net uptake of about 3 gigatons
4449278 who is to say the climate we have is the ideal climate
4449279 who are we to say that pacific islanders prefer their islands above water
4449280 despite these fluctuations the atmosphere is able to bounce back and return to the basically the same equilibrium position in a rather short period of time
4449281 the dreary summers afflicting ireland britain france scandinavia and benelux as well as spain portugal and italy are causing increased scepticism about the reality of global warming
4449282 some kind of estimate for how much the earths atmosphere can take in terms of a fluctuation
4449283 all of which is due to human emissions your calculations are wrong because you are neglecting that the ocean land sources are almost in balance with the sinks but that the real sink out of the land atmosphere upper ocean system is the flux into the deep ocean which is much slower
4449284 when people want to increase energy costs and change lifestyles due to global warming the burden of proof is on them
4449285 when people want to trigger mass extinctions and ecosystem collapse by ignoring global warming the burden of proof is on them
4449286 as for your no global equilibrator argument of course there is an equilibrator if there wasnt there would not stable weather patterns or a livable earth
4449287 h2o is a greenhouse gas and we dont produce h2o so climate warming is incorrect
4449288 well turbulence makes the bee fly so therefore you should fly better when theres turbulence so all that cat scare is bull
4449289 but the amount of the imbalance is tiny or wed see a rapid change in earths temperatures
4449290 the big point for me here anyway is just how inexact the science is of global warming to be sure it occurring we have some ideas how but not the whole picture hence we need more research and more of a concerted effort to mitigate the known causes as well as find out what isnt known meanwhile we shouldnt rush to judgment or policy for that matter otherwise we may just have another corn ethanol situation on our hands a lot of time money and attention being put into something futile

4449303 the whole point of this settlement was to aid them to get the 423 million from the state and it was not to resolve the ultimate issue which is in court
4449304 if they win they get the money if they dont win they dont get the money from the city
4449305 that is essentially what we told the state to get them to approve the settlement and we dont fund but about 9 percent of their budget anyway so theres nothing we can do to catapult them into insolvency

4449328 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
4449329 but getting people back into hard hit neighborhoods is one of the challenges we still face
4449330 people wont come back unless there are jobs for them while companies arent going to move here unless there are people to work for them
4449331 the worst affected are people in the lower income brackets who dont know how to navigate their way through the system where the rules seem to change from day to day
4449332 unfortunately this is a state programme and i simply cant get rid of all the bureaucracy
4449333 but i can streamline the processes and tighten deadlines to make the programme run faster
4449334 this will not be a city of half a million people again for a very long time for new orleans the best way forward is to let go of the past and look to a different future

4449339 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4449340 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution
4449341 but in taking these steps we need to keep in mind that we do not do anything which hurts the growth rate
4449342 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation

4449345 conditions now are looking as if the fundamental change of mission will be able to take place next year
4449346 from a uk point of view were getting pretty close to achieving what we went there to do to be honest
4449347 obviously theres considerable planning going on with the americans as to what the future construct in iraq is going to look like
4449348 the americans quite sensibly want the force reductions to be such that they can maintain the gains theyve made and obviously we will be in discussion with them military to military as to how we take that planning forward
4449349 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it
4449350 concentrate put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket

4449425 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance

4449428 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders

4449430 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4449431 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4449432 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4449433 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4449434 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4449435 that michael phelps can take a three minute shower in 2 1 2 minutes

4449573 there is a growing movement for patients to rate doctors and give feedback on the internet we felt that we needed a partner that allowed our physicians to review and respond to negative feedback and resolve any issues at an early stage which has shown to reduce malpractice risk

4449640 for the next three weeks he will continue on the rehabilitation and then the final part will be endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side
4449641 i have nothing to say about that nothing has changed
4449642 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones but the backbone will be the midfield players and defenders who are all available
4449643 we have good variety there and hopefully thats enough to get us through the first hurdle that will be the foundation
4449644 you would think with young players like anderson ronaldo rooney and nani there is improvement there
4449645 i think thats the most natural thing you could say about our club these players have that capacity to improve

4449659 look at the reaction on some of these references this cant be good
4449660 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
4449661 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
4449662 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
4449663 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighbouring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
4449664 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
4449665 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
4449666 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
4449667 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
4449668 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
4449669 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
4449670 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
4449671 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
4449672 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
4449673 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
4449674 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
4449675 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
4449676 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr

4449703 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4449704 we are looking to the court to ultimately impose a total sentence in the case that improves on past responses to this serious national regional and international problem
4449705 prosecution of child sex offenders in the east asia pacific region continues to be low and sentences do not reflect the gravity of the crime
4449706 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4449707 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4449708 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide

4449710 kondisi kedua pilot baik baik saja mereka sedang menjalani perawatan medis
4449711 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4449712 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4449713 it was a beautiful thing to watch all those people lift up that bus
4449714 i was thinking oh my goodness i can see it now the chinese accused of harsh and brutal tactics against human rights protesters show that they serve kfc and tea to their prisoners they wanted to document our treatment
4449715 just as in other countries assemblies processions and demonstrations must be held according to relevant legal regulations and procedures and shall not be carried out without approval from relevant authorities
4449716 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4449717 all i can remember is going up i went up and i came down and i hit something very very hard
4449718 a soldier told me i hit the footpath but as far as i was concerned i thought i hit a telegraph pole cause all i could see was sparks and the smell of rubber
4449719 i looked down and i could see annes skirt and i thought oh poor annes been injured too
4449720 i thought wheres the rest of the girls and they werent i couldnt see anybody
4449721 i think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation
4449722 my father said and i do believe his words theres a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it
4449723 thats quite true cause its been proved cause all those people round me were all taken and i was saved but in saying that it was a hard fight a very hard fight
4449724 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4449725 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4449726 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4449727 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4449728 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4449729 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4449730 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4449731 the video were found in a cellular telephone that a border policeman lost

4449733 in a tough environment you tighten your belt and your structure
4449734 the only area with difficulties is our smaller cap but it has been doing better since july 15
4449735 members might hold their nose when they vote for the deal but we cant stay with current management
4449736 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4449737 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4449738 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4449739 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4449740 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4449741 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4449742 this was about them deferring some standard maintenance and continuing to fly the aircraft
4449743 this potentially could have compromised the safety of passengers and the crew
4449744 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans actions in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive
4449745 they can present their case but in our view this is an appropriate amount especially considering they knowingly flew these planes with passengers aboard
4449746 from those hearings the suggestion was that there was far too cozy a relationship between the faa and the airlines inspection management
4449747 they seem to have taken more of a hard line approach and are not as willing to negotiate down the fines
4449748 this is just a big splash to make it look like theyre being tough with the airlines
4449749 this is like fining a lexus dealer for not changing the oil these are regulatory violations more than anything and as far as the public being endangered absolutely not what theyre arguing about is whether these planes could only fly under certain conditions
4449750 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4449751 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4449752 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the united states than ever before
4449753 the returns his sponsors are getting are amazing at this particular point
4449754 its not easy when every single thing that is happening at the games is framed yes eclipsed by phelps mania
4449755 within a few weeks well have the nfl and college football and the homestretch of baseball
4449756 olympic athletes by and large have very short cycles in which they can generate revenues as sponsors
4449757 theres a longevity to phelps that typically you dont find in olympic athletes
4449758 he needs to buff out his personality and really demonstrate his charisma
4449759 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4449760 fewer highway deaths is always the silver lining of a down economy
4449761 the campaign did not pledge any federal matching funds certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4449762 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4449763 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4449764 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4449765 the crowd comprised a slice of america that mccain needs if he intends to win pennsylvania and the election and that slice is white i did not spot a single african american in the crowd rural exurban and mostly protestant with local roots stretching back centuries
4449766 to scare the bejesus out of southern whites evangelical christians and combative neocons
4449767 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4449768 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4449769 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4449770 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4449771 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4449772 ultimately al qaida couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4449773 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4449774 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4449775 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4449776 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4449777 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4449778 im the only person in america having g rated sex and that was six months ago
4449779 when youve been married as long as i have seeing your wife naked is having sex
4449780 heres the thing about monogamy it only works if you cheat
4449781 why should pennsylvania founded by the english become a colony of aliens who will shortly be so numerous as to germanize us instead of our anglifying them
4449782 in large sections of the country the native american will entirely disappear he will not inter marry with inferior races and he cannot compete in the sweat shop and in the street trench with the newcomers
4449783 not only sized up president bush humiliatingly well but precisely anticipated europes nonreaction while taking a perfect fit measure of georgias mercurial president
4449784 not only knew what he was doing he knew exactly what others would do
4449785 the months of meticulous planning and extensive preparations for this invasion that were covered by military exercises disingenuous explanations and maskirovka the art of deception the red army had mastered
4449786 the russians convinced us to see what we wanted to see
4449787 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4449788 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past
4449789 rather than favoring one company or the other our view is that it favors the war fighter
4449790 personalmente me cae bien y le deseo que le vayan bien las cosas en su partido

4449803 the last time we saw a decline like this was in the recession of 1991
4449804 they are not even running in place they are moving backward
4449805 now that the tidal surge in energy and other commodity costs is showing unmistakable signs of turning up in consumer prices at large the fed finds itself pushed further into the corner
4449806 indicates that jobs remain hard to find and that labor demand is soft
4449807 the market is working the process seems to be going forward at a faster pace than people had anticipated i would think that with a little bit of luck the fourth quarter should be better
4449808 energy prices do seem to be coming down a bit so im hopeful that going forward we wont see as much of an increase
4449809 that decline will translate into lower gasoline prices and lower prices across the board

4449827 i have a hard time drinking milk after that lady told us about all that pus in it
4449828 lord you said that once i decided to follow you youd walk with me all the way but i have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints i dont understand why when i needed you most you would leave me
4449829 my son my precious child i love you and i would never leave you during your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints it was then that i carried you
4449830 im sitting in a hotel room in germany in the middle of my summer tour with the tv news telling me that my home country is being torn to pieces
4449831 throughout this week i havent been able to stop watching the news ive never seen it like this before its never made me feel so naked isolated and angry
4449832 with the russians still being in gori there are reports that they have stopped fighting but you dont need to be killing a countrys people or its soldiers to paralyse it
4449833 you see gori is right in the middle of the only road that goes from west to east across georgia
4449834 its the road that my mum and brother need to travel on to catch their return flight out of tbilisi
4449835 georgia has always had shaky politics especially after the break up of the soviet union and the civil war that followed in the 90s

4449839 yo the next door neighbors are havin an ike and tina moment
4449840 while the figures for july are disappointing one should not read too much into an over sized drop in multiple starts in a single month
4449841 this month to month volatility in this market segment is remarkably high on both the upside and downside
4449842 the trend in single starts is usually more telling and it remains consistent with our theme for this sector of the canadian economy which is that it should experience a cooling after running too hot for too long
4449843 a greater number of existing homes for sale and the continued long term shift to smaller and relatively cheaper multiple family units will continue to put downward pressure on single family starts over the next 12 18 months
4449844 there will be a natural tendency to read too much into this monthly decline and straight line these figures forward to conclude that construction is falling off the rails
4449845 we think it important to caution observers against such a knee jerk reaction to this months cmhc report residential construction is easing and should continue to do so but at a modest year over year rate of 3 5 contraction not julys 16
4449846 based on what happened in the first half of the year the canadian real estate associations market analysis shows a record high national average residential price by the end of 2008 but with a much more modest increase than was recorded in 2007
4449847 however since the declines were mostly in the western cities where prices were not too long ago appreciating at a double digit pace we remain confident that the extent of the slowdown nationally will remain measured
4449848 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
4449849 this brings activity since the start of the year closer in line with our 2008 forecast of more than 200 000 housing starts for the seventh consecutive year

4449857 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4449858 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
4449859 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved

4449870 i think more and more people are starting to get interested and hopefully starting to get more involved
4449871 so i think my goal of raising the bar in the sport of swimming is coming along nicely but i think it is still going to take time for me to really get it to where i want it to be
4449872 i thought yes enjoy this moment because it is unique
4449873 and i think it was a super race even if i had not gotten a medal it would be fine but then i turned around and everything was just great

4449891 what you have seen the insurgency is a political device by the youths to draw the attention of the authorities to the unsettled issues in the oil and gas producing regions of nigeria

4449929 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
4449930 whatever is happening i dont think it is attributable to rogue elements
4449931 in any intelligence service especially for covert operations you often try to maintain a level of deniability so that the top decision makers are not fully informed about what is going on
4449932 there are still huge differences between the military and the politicians as to how to combat terrorism what to do about it the military is really controlling the policy the civilians dont have much of a say
4449933 this is one of the reasons why pakistan has not been able to fight the war on terror decisively and why there are so many differences with the americans on this not everyone is reading from the same page
4449934 formally the director general of the isi reports to the prime minister the director general of the isi however is a three star general appointed by the chief of army staff who reports to the president the eight departments of the isi are headed by eight two star generals who are chosen by the director general of the isi and the budget comes out of the defense and intelligence budget which is not subject to civilian review in pakistan
4449935 so while formally the isi reports to the prime minister the control is effectively lodged with the military
4449936 now how that actually works that is who finally makes decisions i dont know
4449937 isi is heavily manned by people from the armed forces so it is not an organization which is a purely civilian organization
4449938 it would be correct to say that it has not been controlled really by the prime minister the way it should be technically and constitutionally it is under the control of the prime minister but operationally speaking and substantively speaking the prime ministers have not really even strengthened the defense cabinet committees
4449939 as the isi stands today it pretty much doesnt function under these kind of parliament related civilian controls
4449940 past that period the isi strategy that has flowered the training that was given was really essentially religionized militancy and islamicized militancy
4449941 and the tools the assets that were developed by the intelligence agency were subsequently used to reach the goals of pakistans own security interests and for battling pakistans own security threats as perceived by intelligence agencies in pakistan
4449942 this country has been under military rule quite a lot when it has been under military rule one section of the isi has been used by military rulers to engineer the political situation in the country
4449943 and for that it has earned a very bad reputation
4449944 internally obviously there has always been a big question that we need to have an organization which reports to the executive and the reporting lines are stringent and there is oversight thats the concern within the country
4449945 there has been an effort in the past under general musharraf the question of growing a nexus between the executive authority and the isi so that there is unity of command general musharraf has been very keen that the intelligence agency would come completely under his control
4449946 now the question of course is with an elected government how do you arrange this control of the isi

4449955 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4449956 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4449957 it needs to be a formal ceasefire which is what we are working on
4449958 but in order to get to that point there really does have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected because the united states would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests are not protected
4449959 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4449960 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so

4449964 i decided to take these two weeks off from tournament golf as with automatic qualification now out of the question i thought it very important to put in some serious practice time so i am ready to perform to the best of my ability should i come into the reckoning for a captains selection
4449965 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4449966 after these few days with my wife and family i am ready to get down to some serious hard work at gleneagles which is no more than 10 minutes from home so some long hours can easily be put in
