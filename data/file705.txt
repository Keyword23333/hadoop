7050001 to have any of these people alerted by an e mail from the campaign before they heard from obama himself would have been classless really
7050002 what seemed like a brilliant exercise in media management devolved into a late night rearguard maneuver so the 3 a m message seemed unplanned a response to the medias confirmation of the biden pick a number of people on twitter reported being awakened by the message never ideal

7050089 the experience in speaker idol competition at teched sea 2008 was great it reminds me of those debating competitions that i participated when i was in high school presentation skills are something that will go a long way in your career most people have no problems giving presentation but not many can see how well they are presenting speaker idol is a good testing ground for this with the 10 minutes time limit it requires you to focus on giving the most captivate presentation that is within the attention spans of most audiences most people tend to be long winded and afraid to miss out every single detail in the presentation this risks losing the audience attention before the core message is presented

7050108 barack hat senator joe biden ausgew hlt unser kandidat als vizepr sident zu sein
7050109 es w re mir eine ehre mit oder gegen john mccain anzutreten
7050110 es hat keinen sch rferen kritiker an barack obamas fehlender erfahrung gegeben als joe biden
7050111 mit seinen eigenen worten er rtert dass barack obama nicht bereit ist pr sident zu werden
7050112 in meinem eifer unsere ideale neu zu entfachen habe ich einige fehler gemacht
7050113 biden ist teil des washingtoner establishments aus diesem umstand kann sich eine spannung zu dem auf einen wechsel gegen eben dieses establishment ausgerichteten wahlkampf obamas ergeben

7050115 tends to answer questions very rapidly without thinking of the correct answers
7050116 from a tech point of view the mass txt message seems to have failed
7050117 im not excited by obamas choice of biden hes got a long record of aggressively supporting the consumer debt machines that have created so much of the subprime lending mess we find ourselves in today and in a campaign that has succeeded in large part on the idea of change and progress hes simply a throwback
7050118 biden is almost a neocon in his foreign policy views he voted for the iraq war in 2002 does his elevation by obama signal that that the obama campaign is backing away from its timetable to withdraw from iraq does bidens position differ significantly from mccains isnt he in fact closer to mccains view on iraq than obama is
7050119 barack obamas choice of joseph biden as his running mate is likely to bring up lots of old stories about the long time senator from delaware in 1998 someone called me to talk about the sale of bidens house which had been a minor issue in his re election campaign two years earlier but when i traveled to delaware i found there was more to it than met the eye and it was just part of bidens close intertwined relationship with mbna the giant credit card company based in his home state

7050130 there is some evidence that certain serious viruses may be transmittable through breastmilk for this reason it is not advisable to use a previously owned breastpump breastpumps are single user products or personal care items much like a toothbrush and are registered with the fda as single user items for safety used breastpumps should never be shared resold or lent among mothers medela strongly discourages mothers from re using or re selling previously owned breastpump equipment the medela pump in style breastpump has an internal diaphragm that cannot be removed replaced or fully sterilized therefore the risk of cross contamination associated with re using a previously owned pump such as the pump in style cannot be totally dismissed multiple use of single user breastpump automatically voids the warranty of the medela product each mother who wishes to express milk with a pump should use a clean uncontaminated breastpump this is the safest way to eliminate any risk of cross contamination

7050157 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing

7050159 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers

7050213 witness the last two democratic presidential nominees al gore and john kerry one each from harvard and yale both earnest decent intelligent men both utterly incapable of communicating with the larger electorate
7050214 boy those ivy leaguers sure are clueless and socially awkward elitists who are out of touch with the normal everyday folks
7050215 rich college educated folk look stupid when they try to act as advocates for the poor and disenfranchised
7050216 i went to yale and a work colleague disclosed that s he went to brown i didnt even know what to say to them from that point on how does one make conversation with people like that
7050217 in the winter of 2004 under the leadership of president lawrence h summers harvard transformed the financial aid landscape with its announcement that families with annual incomes below 40 000 would not be expected to pay for their sons or daughters to go to harvard the zero contribution threshold was raised to 60 000 in 2006 with further reductions in parental contributions for families with incomes up to 80 000 over the past three years the number of students in these income ranges has increased by 33 percent representing a quarter of the entering class of 2011
7050218 harvards new financial aid policy dramatically reduces the amount families with incomes below 180 000 will be expected to pay families with incomes above 120 000 and below 180 000 and with assets typical for these income levels will be asked to pay 10 percent of their incomes for those with incomes below 120 000 the family contribution percentage will decline steadily from 10 percent reaching zero for those with incomes at 60 000 and below for example a typical family making 120 000 will be asked to pay approximately 12 000 for a child to attend harvard college compared with more than 19 000 under existing student aid policies for a typical family with 180 000 of income the payment would be approximately 18 000 compared with more than 30 000 today the new standard reduces the cost to families by one third to one half making the price of a harvard education for students on financial aid comparable to the cost of in state tuition and fees at the nations leading public universities the new initiative also establishes a standard that students and their families can easily understand
7050219 this is a hahvahd bar huh i thought thered be equations and shit on the walls

7050225 the plumber was standing in my kitchen there he was a short beefy guy with a goatee and a red sox cap and a thick boston accent and i suddenly learned that i didnt have the slightest idea what to say to someone like him
7050226 im not like the person this guy describes therefore his premises are bullshit
7050227 i think there are a lot of ivy league students who would be shocked to read this about themselves brown students in my experience have an often startling inability to be sentient about themselves
7050228 exactly i know plenty of skilled blue collar workers who make really good money here in new york that often means six figures probably more than a lot of ivy grads who didnt go into a profession like law or medicine its not so much a class divide as an educational one
7050229 sure i saw a lot of rich twats running around campus wasting daddys money but i mostly ignored them and spent my time and energy on the normal cool people i didnt really see it as some ingrained culture that necessarily permeates everything there
7050230 maybe it helped that i worked in the dining hall all 4 years got treated like shit by most of the student populace
7050231 i know literally dozens of people that decided the residence college social scene was bogus and fake narrow and contrived and abandoned it in favor of something a little more broadening
7050232 that doesnt mean theyre dumb or inferior just that theyre not necessarily cut out for college at that time
7050233 my education taught me to believe that people who didnt go to an ivy league or equivalent school werent worth talking to regardless of their class
7050234 this paper covers all the bases its all true and youve done a pretty good job laying it all out this is a good baseline paper no significant errors

7050249 the hardest part of my maturing was accepting that i should make music for a living i had avoided it my whole life because i was scared to even try to do something that 99 fail so unceremoniously at i never took music or even art in highschool after the 9th grade i took math and science i didnt take any creative courses whatsoever i knew music was what i was sorta groomed to do but i didnt want to do it i remember the day i decided though i even remember the weather and where i was standing i had just been fired from my day job and the first copies of heads up has been pressed i drove home and while standing on my curb smoking a cigarette looking up at the house i could no longer afford i decided i was gonna do it i was going to make music my life at this point id already toured the world id already put out over 10 records id been doing it for about 10 years with every moment of my spare time it wasnt like i hadnt started i just never thought for a moment i would make any money from it i had always figured i should do something else for money and just do music when i could its not for everyone though i know that for sure it takes up your whole life something not everyone is willing to give up and trust me you have to give it up completely or it wont work out
7050250 its just me ive got nobody else to pick up the slack and some days it is just really hard

7050268 at first our mission was to be defensive we would wait for terrorists to attack us and then retaliate
7050269 the iraqi army is now on the offensive which has been directly responsible for many successful missions
7050270 we had multiple successes one being the trust and confidence the people have in the iraqi army
7050271 it is important for them to know we are here for them any time they need us
7050272 allowing iraqis to lead the way is critical to a proper transition of security
7050273 they have the man power they have the equipment and they are building confidence in themselves
7050274 we will extend our security and reach wherever terrorists are and crush them

7050345 people become really quite remarkable when they start thinking that they can do things when they believe in themselves they have the first secret of success
7050346 there is a thinking stuff from which all things are made and which in its original state permeates penetrates and fills the inter spaces of the universe a thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought man can form things in his thought and by impressing his thought upon formless substance can cause the thing he thinks about to be created
7050347 by thought the thing you want is brought to you by action you receive it
7050348 if you act in the present with your mind on the future your present action will be with a divided mind and will not be effective
7050349 the wind swept her hair as she struggled to walk against the breeze up a steep hill
7050350 with couples today struggling with the average males declining sperm count the low libido levels caused by the increasing use of psychotropic drugs and the low supply of adoptable children both domestically and internationally angelinas lack of knowledge about her family size shows she is clearly a parental elitist
7050351 if you dont know how many kids you have then its not surprising that you might think that children are relatively easy to get
7050352 but if youre like millions of people struggling to get pregnant or adopt a child you might have a different perspective

7050369 it is possible to store the mind with a million facts and still be entirely uneducated
7050370 before we got clean most of our actions were guided by impulse today we are not locked into this type of thinking
7050371 few people have any next they live from hand to mouth without a plan and are always at the end of their line

7050373 always have a plan and believe in it nothing happens by accident

7050377 i have over 35 years of fire research in my experience i worked in the fire program at nist for 19 years leaving as a division chief i have been at the university of maryland since i am a founding member and past chair of the international association for fire safety science the principal world forum for fire research
7050378 in my opinion the wtc investigation by nist falls short of expectations by not definitively finding cause by not sufficiently linking recommendations of specificity to cause by not fully invoking all of their authority to seek facts in the investigation and by the guidance of government lawyers to deter rather than develop fact finding
7050379 i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable explained dr
7050380 i hope to convince you to perhaps become conspiracy theorists but in a proper way he said
7050381 oh what i would do to have the kind of faith it takes to climb out of this boat with him on to the crashing waves
7050382 our government is not supposed to collect information on the innocent activities and movements of its citizens just in case they later commit a crime
7050383 this program illustrates why america needs more robust and across the board privacy laws
7050384 the customs and border protection agency function is taking the approach that the border is a constitution free zone
7050385 congress needs to step in and reassert the american values of limited intrusion on americans private lives
7050386 this is just the latest in a long list of misguided dhs security policies from trying to waive all laws at the border to building a wall at the u s border to redirecting the automated tracking system from assessing the risk of cargo to assessing the risk of travelers to the most recent controversy over detaining laptops at airports it is clear the next administration will need to drastically rethink all of these wrongheaded policies
7050387 not a person of mighty consequence only a great sinner saved by gods grace
7050388 some of you are aware of the fact that a slavery abolition bill has been sent to parliament
7050389 as i have intimate knowledge of the slave trade my dear william wilberforce has requested my testimony before a select parliamentary committee i consider myself bound in conscience to answer this call to wash my hands of the guilt which threatens to constitute a national sin stained with crimson dye
7050390 since i agreed to appear i have received repeated threats from some who benefit most by the cursed trade they say that if i insist on going through with my testimony they will reveal to you my dear parishioners and friends the darkest evils of my own wretched past life i will be publicly shamed and humiliated even forced from the ministry they accuse me of being a hypocrite well my friends i can only say that i hope it will always be a subject of humiliating reflection to me that i was once an instrument in this awful business at which my heart now shudders
7050391 every age seems to have people who have made a habit of evil who have had to look up in order to see the bottom
7050392 yet in the day of gods power they are saved and transformed they become an example to other believers giving them an opportunity to praise god for his amazing grace i my good people was one of these god saved me so that people would look at me and say if god could save john newton he can save anyone surely you can understand then that my silence at such a time as this would be criminal even though my words come too late to prevent or repair the misery and horror to which i was an accessory
7050393 those of you who have read my publication narrative must think you know me well but had i given details of the wickedness of my heart and life it would have been too shocking for my readers to bear
7050394 you will not hear it from them you will hear it from me i will tell you my story

7050417 im sitting here and im drinking from a carton of milk right now
7050418 and the elitexc lightweight champion kj noons face is on the back of this milk carton because hes missing in action i cant seem to find him
7050419 when noons camp wants to track us down and tell us how nick diaz isnt the right fight for them or they want more money or they want this out of their contract or this and that theyre easy to get a hold of
7050420 we like to think that kj noons is a true champion a true mixed martial artist he realizes the opportunity that hes been given that other mma fighters havent been given the opportunity to be showcased on national television the opportunities for championships the money hes already making we expect him to honor the contract he signed and to fight nick diaz the no 1 contender the only contender right now the leading contender for kj noons
7050421 since day one noons manager mark dion has been insinuating that elitexc has been out to get kj noons
7050422 i just cant figure that out when a guy appears on the very first card and the very first fight gets knocked out in the very first round off the very first punch and were there to hold his hand and pick him back up and put him right back on television in a main event on shoxc
7050423 and then when hes 1 1 get him right back into a main event situation for the world championship against nick diaz the legend who beat gomi how are you going to say that were not trying to help your kid what more opportunity could we give the kid
7050424 maybe the problem with his camp is its called city boxing they think that they can manage a career like a boxer
7050425 i come from the boxing world and these are two totally different careers these contracts are totally different fighters in boxing fight on a per fight basis noons already has a deal that states what hes going to make and when you sign that you already know what youre going to make in your fourth fight so we expect you to honor that
7050426 noons is earning in his next fight about 23 000 to show
7050427 that to me is already more than any fighter who has under 10 fights is making hes highly paid
7050428 theres a spot for kj noons to face nick diaz on the oct 4 card
7050429 if this fight doesnt go off then this a textbook case in business law of harbor it would be called the kj noons case it will be the biggest mismanagement of an athletes career you will ever see this is a chance to maximize his exposure right now
7050430 the update on the deadline is nothing is going to happen with it
7050431 thats whats going to happen with that i dont care about how many threats shaw wants to pull well be doing a press conference if elitexc doesnt see the light here pretty soon and if shaw doesnt stop talking expletive
7050432 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there
7050433 to elitexc he is hes the number one for getting eyeballs to watch them theyre pushing on eyeballs versus a career move for a champion like kj kj is really not the one who gets anything out of the fight diaz does and so does proelite
7050434 but theres nothing in it for kj unless elitexc finally wakes up a little bit thats why well have a press conference i dont like to talk and beat a company thats already beat down im going to give them the benefit of the doubt hopefully theyll see the light
7050435 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender
7050436 hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
7050437 eddie alvarez is getting married but thats not our problem
7050438 he had a long layoff but hes making more money than the no 1 ranked expletive fighter in the world anderson silva or the same amount
7050439 and now anderson silva is getting bud light sponsorships from ufc president dana white handed down to him
7050440 who do you think negotiated that expletive contract a year and a half ago and if you look at my post it the one i negotiated was a 7 million deal for four years its nothing close to 100 000 and 100 000 as a win bonus as far as trying to bring in the mark dion negatives and stuff good luck show me any negatives on it and thats just a pitch elitexc can use but hey i know my expletive ive been around this sport a long long time
7050441 i dont bend over for nobody and i dont let my fighters do it
7050442 im not a booking agent i dont book my fighters and schmooze deals to work for the promoters i work for my fighters

7050465 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7050466 ok this is as optimised as its going to get
7050467 when you consume ordinary noodles made from wheat or corn you may soon feel your stomach empty but this soybean noodle delays such a feeling of hunger
7050468 biden is strong hes a bulldog no one in politics can take him on one on one
7050469 youre marrying up shes better than you smarter and better looking dont worry i married up too but you need to hold onto her and not let her go

7050475 i have proposed three creeds to your conclusion which ought thoroughly to be believed and embraced by all those that would be accounted christians viz the nicene creed athanasius his creed and the creed commonly called the apostles the last of which contains a summary of the gospel which is industriously opened and explained and i beseech you do not slight it because of its form nor antiquity nor because supposed to be composed by men neither because some that hold it maintain some error or whose conservation may not be correspondent to such fundamental principles of salvation but take this for a perpetual rule that whatever is good in any owned by any whatever error or vice it may be mixed withal the good must not be rejected for the error or vice sake but owned commended and accepted
7050476 if he wins black people are gonna have to come up with a new excuse

7050515 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
7050516 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
7050517 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
7050518 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
7050519 the first run was ok the track was improving and the grip level was getting better with every lap on the second run i had a good lap except for a small mistake in turn 14 where i lost two to three tenths but it was still not bad then on the last run i had some problems with the traffic on my out lap and couldnt warm up the tyres so they werent ready for the first couple of corners so i locked up in the first corner thats why i couldnt improve my lap time which was for sure disappointing as the final run is always the quickest and i couldnt improve my time so last on the grid lets see for tomorrow
7050520 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7050521 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7050522 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7050523 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7050524 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7050525 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7050526 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7050527 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7050528 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7050529 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education
7050530 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is still a small gap to mclaren qualifying went pretty smoothly with only the weather a bit unstable in the end there were only some rain drops in the second qualifying session but this did not affect the result the choice of tyres was pretty clear for me by yesterday i went on the harder compound in q1 and on the softer compound in q2 and in q3
7050531 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isnt the case in every team i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there generally speaking im a lot happier with my car today on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
7050532 on this new and demanding track robert had a great qualifying again and fought his way through to p3 on the grid nick improved in the second part of qualifying and made it into q3 with the third best time overall his last lap wasnt perfect as he lost some time in the second sector anyway eighth is good what these positions are worth we shall see tomorrow during the first pit stops we had no technical problems during qualifying
7050533 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points that is again our target tomorrow its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
7050534 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy
7050535 creo que refleja un hartazgo no s lo con el crimen sino con la displicencia de las autoridades y su negligencia es un llamado que todos los ciudadanos aprobar amos de que ya finalmente hay que hacer algo
7050536 les dijo a todos los funcionarios desde los medianos hasta los m s altos que si la vara con que los med an era muy alta y no serv an que renunciaran y se fueran se me hizo muy impresionante
7050537 creo que en m xico eso nunca hab a pasado que mart les dijera si no pueden v yanse no ocupen una oficina no ganen un sueldo que no est n ejerciendo bien pues eso es corrupci n tambi n
7050538 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7050539 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7050540 oh how cute a girl dj whos booked to play d amp b

7050544 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7050545 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7050546 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7050547 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7050548 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7050549 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7050550 for sure you always want to be on top and starting on the pole position here for the first time is very nice
7050551 the track here is not very easy especially the surface which is a little slippery so to make the perfect lap is difficult i got the pole position with the first sector on the final run it was just fantastic i made some small mistakes in sector two then had a good sector three but everything was done in sector one
7050552 hes going to be hard to beat tomorrow i think i was already down a tenth or two tenths after the first corner turns four and five did not seem as strong as id like it was not a shocking lap
7050553 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
7050554 es war ein sehr gutes qualifying f r unser team und f r mich
7050555 nach zuletzt ein paar ungl cklichen rennen ist unser auto hier in valencia nicht schlecht trotzdem gibt es noch einen kleinen r ckstand zu ferrari und mclaren
7050556 im qualifying lief alles ziemlich glatt nur die wetterprognose war etwas instabil am ende hatten wir nur ein paar regentropfen in q2 die keinerlei einfluss auf das ergebnis hatten f r mich war die reifenwahl nach dem gestrigen training klar ich habe in q1 die h rtere mischung verwendet in q2 und q3 die weichere
7050557 platz acht ist nicht perfekt aber ich denke viel mehr war nicht drin schlie lich spielt auch das sprit gewicht eine rolle
7050558 in q1 glaubte ich schon an ein d ja vu als mir timo glock im weg stand bei uns im team bekommen wir ber funk gesagt um wie viel sekunden hinter uns ein schnelles auto kommt und wann wir platz machen m ssen anscheinend funktioniert das nicht in allen teams so ich f rchtete schon mein qualifying sei ruiniert aber zum gl ck konnte ich direkt noch eine zweite runde fahren die schnell genug war
7050559 q2 lief gut da war ich drittschnellster man hat gesehen dass die pace da ist insgesamt bin ich heute viel zufriedener mit meinem auto am freitag kam ich berhaupt nicht zurecht seither haben wir stark umgebaut
7050560 auch auf dieser neuen und anspruchsvollen strecke hat robert erneut ein hervorragendes qualifying absolviert und sich platz drei in der startaufstellung erk mpft nick hat sich vor allem im zweiten qualifying in der entscheidenden runde sehr gesteigert und sich mit der drittbesten zeit f r den finalen durchgang qualifiziert
7050561 die letzte runde hat bei ihm nicht perfekt gepasst vor allem im zweiten sektor hat er zeit verloren trotzdem auch sein platz ist in ordnung was diese positionen wert sind werden wir morgen bei den ersten tankstopps sehen technische probleme gab es w hrend des qualifyings nicht
7050562 das war ein sehr spannendes qualifikationstraining im ersten teil fielen einige regentropfen und im zweiten waren die zeiten sehr eng beisammen es ist positiv dass wir diesmal wieder beide fahrzeuge in den top 10 haben nick hat in q2 eine sehr starke runde hingelegt und sich damit ganz sicher f r q3 qualifiziert
7050563 robert fuhr ebenfalls sehr gut und hat vom dritten startplatz aus eine ausgezeichnete ausgangslage f rs rennen aber auch f r nick sollte einiges m glich sein es ist erfreulich dass sich unsere arbeit seit dem letzten rennen in budapest ausgezahlt hat
7050564 das ist doch schon mal was mal wieder in die top 10 zu kommen auf dieser strecke ist unser auto besser es ist nicht super aber besser
7050565 ich habe eine sehr gute strategie mit viel sprit f r morgen daher ist f r morgen alles offen
7050566 wir verstehen jetzt einfach wo wir falsch gegangen sind und dadurch l uft es dann auch besser wir verstehen mehr und mehr und das ist auch wichtig f r n chstes jahr
7050567 es ist auch streckenspezifisch es kann beim n chsten rennen wieder anders aussehen
7050568 ich kann mich gar nicht mehr erinnern an die punkte so weit weg sind die schon ich erhoffe mir morgen schon einige punkte das w re sch n
7050569 nach einem schwierigen training gestern haben wir das setup f r heute komplett ge ndert
7050570 dann hatten wir am morgen ein problem mit der lpumpe am getriebe daher konnte ich es gar nicht probieren ich fuhr also am nachmittag ohne wissen aber ich nutzte meine erfahrung konzentrierte mich und schaffte es in q3 beim letzten versuch machte ich noch einen fehler aber ich bin dennoch zufrieden ich bin auch erfreut wie sich das auto entwickelt wir k nnen immer um die top 10 k mpfen und punkte sammeln das ist auch f r morgen das ziel
7050571 ich wei nicht das schiefgelaufen ist ich konnte in der zweiten sitzung einfach keine runde zusammenbringen
7050572 wir hatten die chance auf die top 10 aber das qualifying war schwierig die h rteren reifen schienen besser zu sein aber ich brachte im ersten sektor meiner letzten q2 runde keine temperatur in die reifen es war einfach nicht mein tag
7050573 ber nacht habe ich mich schwer verk hlt ich f hle mich nicht sonderlich wohl das soll aber keine ausrede sein
7050574 das auto war gut genug es ging sich halt einfach nicht aus wir werden morgen nat rlich das beste aus der position machen es k nnte safety car phasen geben also werden wir versuchen das beste aus unserer strategischen freiheit zu machen
7050575 insgesamt war es ein schwieriger tag mit einem entt uschenden ergebnis im qualifying
7050576 gestern waren wir konkurrenzf hig speziell mit timo nun hat sich das gedreht
7050577 jarno schlug sich fantastisch weil er am morgen nicht fahren konnte alle seine runden waren gut bis auf die letzte in q3 f r timo war es heute nicht so erfolgreich in q1 war er dabei in q2 lief es nicht so wie erwartet wir m ssen analysieren was passiert ist der regen hat die strecke ber nacht etwas sauber gewaschen aber die reifenfrage ist klar das gute an unserer position ist dass wir uns gegen safety car phase etwas absichern k nnen damit nicht beide autos davon getroffen werden

7050628 na de zoveelste vileine column over de vlaamse burger neergepend door het pseudoniem serge in het waalse dagblad le soir besloot een parate vlaamse nationalist klacht in te dienen bij het cgkr
7050629 hiermee heb ik uiteraard niet gezegd dat onze parate vlaming die tegen serge een klacht heeft ingediend voorheen anti multiculturele parabels zou hebben neergeschreven maar wel dat ik veronderstel dat hij het cgkr niet genegen is
7050630 alhoewel de anti vlaamse berichtgeving in sommige brusselse en waalse media kleinzielig en verwerpelijk is zou een effectieve strafrechtelijke veroordeling slechts leiden tot een verdere communautaire radicalisering in de stoutste dromen van vlaamse separatisten is dit weliswaar een ideaal scenario maar voor gematigde politici journalisten en kiezers zou dit een werkelijke grondige hervorming van belgi in een confederale staat in de weg staan dit is dus niet de te volgen weg
7050631 zou men menselijk niet moeten wensen maar dat is politiek gezien een andere zaak
7050632 wie het cgkr wil bestrijden doet dit bijgevolg alvast via een andere weg zoals het steunen van het verzoekschrift tot vernietiging van de recente wijziging van de anti racismewet bij het constitutioneel hof

7050637 we know that coach justin buttermore is working harder and harder to make the football team better
7050638 and were hoping he can top what hes done the last couple of years
7050639 its about going out there and showing what we can do and cheering for our team hoping we can win
7050640 i know weve lost a lot of players but we also gained a few good ones so im really excited

7050682 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
7050683 so this kind of game in which anybody who i know regardless of how flimsy the relationship is is somehow somehow their ideas could be attributed to me i think the american people are smarter than that theyre not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views because it obviously isnt

7050704 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7050705 its a gimmick a token effort to deal with a very serious problem mr mallard said
7050706 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources the council should provide money to employ security guards
7050707 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police ms shield said

7050719 i thought i would take this opportunity to publicly thank councillor martin tolar
7050720 while a number of other councillors talk about holding office to help our community i can honestly say i have found that only councillor tolar was prepared to do more than pay lip service to this notion
7050721 he was happy to do that but because hes overseas until after the elections he asked me if id start it off for him councillor tolar said

7050723 they had me up on ladders with rollers doing shots she said
7050724 they made us stay 10 to 12 hours a day for the three days and usually we were there five hours a day so it was a massive change to our normal schedule
7050725 i just got so upset because they were basically not letting me leave she said
7050726 coming into the ice cream shop that was ridiculous i dont know what they hoped to achieve by coming around the back of the counter it was like they thought they were on some dramatic tv show its just a cooking show
7050727 they didnt get the angle they wanted with my bosses so they were pretty much scrambling for any bit of excitement they could get from it and i guess that just happened to be it
7050728 she came into the shop and the next thing we know theyre through the front filming us so ive taken her out the back into the store area she said
7050729 then one of them comes through the front behind the counter and bails up my 16 year old daughter while ive got a pregnant sasha out the back
7050730 i thought she was going to have a miscarriage she was so distressed it was disgusting absolutely disgusting
7050731 the police went and told them to pull their heads in because they had no right they never apologised nothing
7050732 id agreed to do the show but it was like theyd never known a pregnant person before
7050733 they didnt make any allowance for it and it would have been nice if theyd been more considerate of me needing more of a break than everyone else
7050734 we were told that speedo could not make enough lzr suits in time for the paralympics and the preference for the suits had to go to the olympians said marayke jonkers who won two bronze medals at the 2004 athens paralympics
7050735 we were told that we had to wait until after the games to find out if there were some left over that we could wear
7050736 unfortunately we are still waiting on news to find out if we will be racing in the lzrs said austin who will be competing at his third paralympics
7050737 i would definitely prefer to race in the lzr we raced in them at the trials so it would be very disappointing if we didnt get to race in them at the games the meet of our career
7050738 were doing everything possible to get them the best possible equipment and im sure that they will be racing in the best possible equipment he said
7050739 there was a breakdown in communication between the team management and the athletes he said
7050740 speedo has done an awesome job to meet the worldwide demand for the lzr racers and fulfilling their commitments to the paralympic team
7050741 it has always been the arrangement to supply the paralympic team with the suit they will definitely get them by the time the games begin

7050747 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7050748 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7050749 i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago

7050771 im not excited by obamas choice of biden hes got a long record of aggressively supporting the consumer debt machines that have created so much of the subprime lending mess we find ourselves in today and in a campaign that has succeeded in large part on the idea of change and progress hes simply a throwback
7050772 biden is almost a neocon in his foreign policy views he voted for the iraq war in 2002 does his elevation by obama signal that that the obama campaign is backing away from its timetable to withdraw from iraq does bidens position differ significantly from mccains isnt he in fact closer to mccains view on iraq than obama is

7050800 i agree with your premise that sutcliffe was not responsible for all the murders
7050801 it was known in the top echelons of the police that two men were involved in the series of murders
7050802 i dont think now that sutcliffe did all the killings he
7050803 this man will continue to kill until hes caught no woman is safe
7050804 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn police that the letters were a hoax however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in fabricating the confession and conviction of humble

7050815 the other only major outstanding feature of the yorkshire ripper investigation remains the identity of the man with the geordie accent who sent george oldfield the infamous letters and tape in 1999 during the production of the itv documentary manhunt the search for the yorkshire ripper a request was made by the production team to west yorkshire police for facilities to film a dna test being made on the envelopes the letters and tape came in it would have been a way of showing the great changes the police had made in the detection of crime the intention was to see if the dna matched any of the profiles held in the then fledgling national dna database if it did not then dna from the envelopes from the gum on theflap or from the stamp the sender would have licked could be registered on the database of crime scene profiles if the person who sent the tapes was arrested for a reportable crime in the future then the police could identify him forensic scientists had already shown he was a blood group b secretor a dna analysis from traces of saliva could have nailed him and brought him to book charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice it was not to be several months after the initial inquiry the somewhat embarrassed response came back sorry weve lost the envelopes and there is no reasonable hope of us finding them the hoaxer has never been traced and probably never will be

7050887 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president can this person help me govern i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7050888 a tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god fearing and pious on the other hand they do less easily move against him believing that he has the gods on his side

7050899 each night god cleans up the mess the argentines make by day
7050900 the day the media realized they were no longer valued by this administration
7050901 we certainly did i thought we were unlucky to go behind
7050902 theyre a big strong team and they were causing us problems
7050903 i think we rectified that in the second half and i think it was a deserved result
7050904 if i say sixth ill be getting crucified by aberdeen supporters
7050905 since the season started weve been hearing that the old firm get all the decisions
7050906 i can sometimes handle my managerial colleagues frustration at that aspect of it it doesnt happen all the time and its clear it doesnt happen all the time
7050907 we got a bad one at tannadice earlier this season which has been forgotten about maybe because we dont make that much of a fuss about it
7050908 same situation here its an incredible decision for a linesman who is in line with the play to actually give an offside on that one
7050909 i thought we were excellent in the first half i thought we played really well in the first half good possession of the ball
7050910 i dont think there was a great deal between the teams in the second half of the game

7050916 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7050917 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7050918 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7050919 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7050920 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7050921 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7050922 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7050923 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7050924 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7050925 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7050926 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7050927 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7050928 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7050929 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7050930 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7050931 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7050932 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7050933 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7050934 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7050935 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7050936 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7050937 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7050938 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7050939 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7050940 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7050941 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7050942 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7050943 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7050944 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7050945 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7050946 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7050947 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7050948 hvis jeg ikke spiser i dag heller er jeg flink n r jeg blir 55 kg liker han meg nok
7050949 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7050950 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del

7050952 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7050953 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7050957 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

7050960 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7050961 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7050962 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7050963 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7050964 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7050965 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7050966 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7050967 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7050968 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7050969 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7050970 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7050971 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7050972 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7050973 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7050974 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7050975 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7050976 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7050977 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7050978 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7050979 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7050980 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7050981 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7050982 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7050983 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7050984 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7050985 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7050986 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7050987 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7050988 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7050989 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7050990 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7050991 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7050992 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7050993 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7050994 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7050995 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo

7051041 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7051042 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7051043 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7051044 hes a regular guy when it comes to being a teammate
7051045 the thing ive gotten to learn about him is his work ethic is pretty impressive he knows hes a pretty special player hes gone about it impressively
7051046 we had a meeting with 25 players who felt like a team we havent felt like that for a week
7051047 evidently the boston thing was something he wanted to change
7051048 i had a great 12 years in new york managing the yankees it was time to go somewhere else
7051049 the guys have received me with open arms its been great
7051050 it feels like im on vacation im here for another month or two after this i dont know whats going to happen im living day by day
7051051 the clubhouse is a little looser were just having fun thats the way its supposed to be
7051052 id say hes changed how everybody reacts around here hes really loose any clubhouse he comes into hes going to make it looser whatever it was whether it was him or us were playing real well right now
7051053 i think the attentions going to follow him the curiosity what hes going to bring to us
7051054 mannys presence and how its changed the personality of the team has helped the guys understand theres a lot of baseball left
7051055 im not sure he wants to be the voice i think hes come in here and basically been himself i think hes surprised all the people have jumped on his coattails i think we were developing a personality we liked before manny arrived i think manny was able to combine the fun part with the work aspect
7051056 i made the right move and was in the right place at the bell but couldnt do any more
7051057 a medal was my goal if im being honest making the final im really pleased with that
7051058 obviously the semi final took a lot out of me and today i made the right move and thought i was in the right place at the bell but i couldnt go anymore
7051059 there was some pretty bad spiking half way round and it knocked me out of my stride a little bit
7051060 i gave it a good go i was where i wanted to be at the bell and i tried to push on with them but couldnt therell be no regrets because i gave it a good go
7051061 im disappointed to come so far down that field especially after running so well in the heats its tough out there its the olympics
7051062 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased

7051072 saya telah bertanya kepada penduduk thusi tentang daerah al ghazalah dan mereka mengingkari keberadaannya
7051073 sungguh saya menyesal tidak belajar khat tulis menulis arab dan saya ingin memperbaiki apa yang telah saya alami pada kedua anak saya ini maka saya mohon engkau mengajarinya dan harta yang saya tinggalkan boleh dihabiskan untuk keduanya
7051074 ketahuilah oleh kalian berdua saya telah membelanjakan untuk kalian dari harta kalian saya seorang fakir dan miskin yang tidak memiliki harta saya menganjurkan kalian berdua untuk masuk ke madrasah seolah olah sebagai penuntut ilmu sehingga memperoleh makanan yang dapat membantu kalian berdua
7051075 kami menuntut ilmu bukan karena allah taala akan tetapi ilmu enggan kecuali hanya karena allah taala
7051076 al ghazali dalam perkataannya sangat dipengaruhi filsafat dari karya karya ibnu sina dalam kitab asy syifa risalah ikhwanish shafa dan karya abu hayan at tauhidi
7051077 perkataannya di ihya ulumuddin pada umumnya baik akan tetapi di dalamnya terdapat isi yang merusak berupa filsafat ilmu kalam cerita bohong sufiyah dan hadits hadits palsu
7051078 orang ini al ghazali menulis kitab dalam mencela filsafat yaitu kitab at tahafut dia membongkar kejelekan mereka akan tetapi dalam beberapa hal menyetujuinya dengan prasangka hal itu benar dan sesuai dengan agama beliau tidaklah memiliki ilmu tentang atsar dan beliau bukanlah pakar dalam hadits hadits rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang dapat mengarahkan akal beliau senang membedah dan meneliti kitab ikhwanush shafa kitab ini merupakan penyakit berbahaya dan racun yang mematikan kalaulah abu hamid bukan seorang yang jenius dan orang yang mukhlis niscaya dia telah binasa
7051079 guru kami abu hamid masuk ke perut filsafat kemudian ingin keluar dan tidak mampu
7051080 abu hamid rahimahullah berhaji dan tinggal di syam sekitar 10 tahun beliau menulis dan bermujahadah dan tinggal di menara barat masjid jami al umawi mendengarkan kitab shahih bukhari dari abu sahl muhammad bin ubaidilah al hafshi
7051081 an nidzam nidzam mulk mengutusnya untuk menjadi pengajar di madrasahnya di baghdad tahun 484 h beliau tinggalkan jabatannya pada tahun 488 h lalu menjadi orang yang zuhud berhaji dan tinggal menetap di damaskus beberapa lama kemudian pindah ke baitul maqdis lalu ke mesir dan tinggal beberapa lama di iskandariyah kemudian kembali ke thusi
7051082 pada akhir kehidupannya beliau tekun menuntut ilmu hadits dan berkumpul dengan ahlinya serta menelaah shahihain shahih bukhari dan muslim seandainya beliau berumur panjang niscaya dapat menguasai semuanya dalam waktu singkat beliau belum sempat meriwayatkan hadits dan tidak memiliki keturunan kecuali beberapa orang putri

7051084 para ahli ushul dari kalangan ahli kalam banyak sekali memasukkan pembahasan kalam ke dalamnya ushul fiqih lantaran kalam telah menguasainya sehingga kecintaannya tersebut telah membuatnya mencampur adukkannya
7051085 setelah kita mengetahui sikap keterlaluan mereka mencampuradukkan permasalahan ini maka kita memandang perlu menghilangkan dari hal tersebut dalam kumpulan ini
7051086 mukadimah ini bukan termasuk dari ilmu ushul dan juga bukan mukadimah khusus untuknya tetapi merupakan mukadimah semua ilmu maka siapa pun yang tidak memiliki hal ini tidak dapat dipercaya pengetahuannya
7051087 ini tertolak karena setiap orang yang akalnya sehat maka berarti dia itu manthiqi lihatlah berapa banyak para imam yang sama sekali tidak mengenal ilmu manthiq
7051088 adapun kitab al madhmun bihi ala ghairi ahlihi bukanlah karya beliau aku telah melihat transkipnya dengan khat al qadhi kamaluddin muhammad bin abdillah asy syahruzuri yang menunjukkan bahwa hal itu dipalsukan atas nama al ghazali beliau sendiri telah menolaknya dengan kitab tahafut
7051089 adapun mengenai kitab al madhmun bihi ala ghairi ahlihi sebagian ulama mendustakan penetapan ini akan tetapi para pakar yang mengenalnya dan keadaannya akan mengetahui bahwa semua ini merupakan perkataannya
7051090 abu hamid telah memenuhi kitab ihya dengan kedustaan terhadap rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam saya tidak tahu ada kitab di muka bumi ini yang lebih banyak kedustaan darinya kemudian beliau campur dengan pemikiran pemikiran filsafat dan kandungan isi rasail ikhwanush shafa mereka adalah kaum yang memandang kenabian merupakan sesuatu yang dapat diusahakan
7051091 adapun penjelasan anda tentang abu hamid maka saya telah melihatnya dan mengajaknya berbicara saya mendapatkan beliau seorang yang agung dari kalangan ulama memiliki kecerdasan akal dan pemahaman beliau telah menekuni ilmu sepanjang umurnya bahkan hampir seluruh usianya dia dapat memahami jalannya para ulama dan masuk ke dalam kancah para pejabat tinggi kemudian beliau bertasawuf menghijrahi ilmu dan ahlinya dan menekuni ilmu yang berkenaan dengan hati dan ahli ibadah serta was was syaitan sehingga beliau rusak dengan pemikiran filsafat dan al hallaj pemikiran wihdatul wujud mulai mencela ahli fikih dan ahli kalam sungguh dia hampir tergelincir keluar dari agama ini ketika menulis al ihya beliau mulai berbicara tentang ilmu ahwal dan rumus rumus sufiyah padahal belum mengenal betul dan tidak memiliki keahlian tentangnya sehingga dia berbuat kesalahan fatal dan memenuhi kitabnya dengan hadits hadits palsu
7051092 adapun di dalam kitab ihya terdapat sejumlah hadits hadits yang batil dan terdapat kebaikan padanya seandainya tidak ada adab dan tulisan serta zuhud secara jalannya ahli hikmah dan sufi yang menyimpang
7051093 syaikh imam hujjatul islam ajubatuz zaman zainuddin abu hamid muhammad bin muhammad bin muhammad bin ahmad ath thusi asy syafii
7051094 beliau tidak berpegang teguh dengan satu mazhab saja dalam buku bukunya akan tetapi beliau menjadi asyari bersama asyariyah sufi bersama sufiyah dan filosof bersama filsafat
7051095 bantahan ibnu taimiyah terhadap al ghazali didasarkan kejelasannya mengikuti filsafat dan terpengaruh dengan sekte bathiniyah dalam mentawil nash nash walaupun beliau membantah habis habisan mereka seperti dalam kitab al mustadzhiri ketika tujuan kitab ini bughyatul murtad pen adalah untuk membantah orang yang berusaha menyatukan agama dan filsafat maka syaikhul islam menjelaskan bentuk usaha tersebut pada al ghazali yang berusaha menafsirkan nash nash dengan tafsir filsafat isyraqi yang didasarkan atas tawil batin terhadap nash sesuai dengan pokok pokok ajaran ahli isyraq pengikut filsafat neo platonisme

7051120 rudy giuliani i mean think about it rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else

7051138 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7051139 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7051140 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7051141 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game

7051143 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7051144 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7051145 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7051146 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start

7051156 its incredibly positive for new jersey there are people in some parts of new jersey who think of him as our third senator

7051169 yo pensaba que ya no me quer an los dominicanos
7051170 im gutted i really thought i could do it today and i just missed out
7051171 i just misjudged my finish a little bit so its disheartening i was desperate to get a medal i wanted it and feel like ive missed a really good opportunity there
7051172 i just missed it by a split second i think its such a fine line in the past ive gone a little bit too hard too early and finished further down so its hard
7051173 there was some more there thats the frustrating thing there was more to give and i messed up tactically
7051174 i would rather have gone 20 seconds slower and have a medal
7051175 i felt yesterday we would be a shoe in for silver and today and we havent got a medal its a bad day hopefully we will have a bit more competition for places next year
7051176 i know im capable of catching people so being behind wasnt a problem its just the fact i had to go though more people than i was hoping to
7051177 we all ran beyond what people predicted we could earlier this season there are still a lot of positives there but theres depression and unhappiness at just missing out on an olympic medal thats hard to bear at the moment
7051178 were a little bit disappointed it was going to be a massive ask to get a medal with three really strong teams
7051179 we had a solid first leg kelly had an awesome second leg and i think marilyn had a battle with the nigerian and had to run wide i tried on the last leg i just had too many people to go round
7051180 i ran a pb leg even though it felt like i ran 56 seconds i ran 54 seconds i ran faster than yesterday and i have never run back to back 400m before

7051222 viviamos em kaniola em um povoado chamado mwirama v rios homens entraram na nossa casa ao amanhecer amarraram se me levaram para fora e abusaram de mim eu escutava gritos no interior da casa mas n o sabia o que estava acontecendo
7051223 quando eu pude me soltar pouco havia restado da casa corri com todas as for as ao corpo do meu esposo e o peguei depois andei como pude porque haviam pegado bastante nas minhas pernas e na coluna em busca de ajuda
7051224 por uma parte estava feliz de encontrar a minha filha com vida por outra me sentia destro ada por
7051225 explica nsimire m e que tamb m nesse momento descobriu que seria av pois nsimire filha estava no quinto m s de gravidez
7051226 na noite que nos sequestraram primeiramente os soldados mataram o meu pai com um disparo quando ele tentou nos proteger depois usaram eu e meus irm os
7051227 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
7051228 marriage next year 25 why not soon you should start popping out children i bet theyre going to have boogers running down their face
7051229 sure they are like in the philippines all the little kids had boogers running down their top lip i knew this one boy who would wait until its on his chin to suck it back up through his nose
7051230 so does that mean that you had boogers dripping down when you were a kid
7051231 does anyone out there in cyberspace remember when they were a child at a sleep over party
7051232 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7051233 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7051234 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7051235 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7051236 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7051237 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7051238 i just landed in italy on a one way flight to turin
7051239 i just landed in italy a few minutes ago and this time my flight was one way with destination turin
7051240 if the team works well like they have in the past then we can reach the final
7051241 i really believe that we can lift the champions league at roma
7051242 i think if the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7051243 no puedo expresar la emoci n que tengo pero quiero dedicarle este gran triunfo a todo mi pa s a mi familia y a los que me ayudaron a vivir el gran sue o del oro ol mpico
7051244 sal al cuadril tero decidido a destrozar a mi rival y no pare de darle golpes ni un s lo segundo
7051245 otros pudieron estar en mi lugar pero no tuvieron suerte con las puntuaciones
7051246 no tengo palabras para describir lo que siento pero es algo maravilloso
7051247 this is a bit better than i have been playing and i have to take it on from here
7051248 i have said all along i feel i have a lot to offer
7051249 with all the ankle operations and all the questions over me if i didnt think i could play this type of cricket i wouldnt have gone through it all again
7051250 it will only be through performances that ultimately i will be judged
7051251 i have not scored 50 for a while so it was nice to stick my bat up i didnt know what to do
7051252 kevin realises i have worked hard on my batting and i think he was just as pleased as i was
7051253 he wants me to play my natural game and the way in which he has seen me bat and knows i can do
7051254 you can play with no fear you can play with freedom but you cant be reckless
7051255 there is a balance for us all to find and hopefully the recklessness is behind me
7051256 i played to my strengths and was quite calculated in the way i played now i have to keep doing that
7051257 i got a few out of the middle early on and gave myself a chance by looking at a few
7051258 i have got a sound technique i feel and a method which has worked in the past
7051259 it is just building on that i have been working with phil on my balance making sure my head is not going over i have two eyes on the ball and i am playing it late
7051260 it was when kevin and i had been at the crease for a while when i decided to take it on a little bit more
7051261 it helped batting with him hes obviously a fine player and he can make things look easy at times
7051262 very single minded determined and that has rubbed off on the rest of the team
7051263 he is very up front with his views and the way he plays his cricket and as a team we are doing that well
7051264 for me as well i am back to a role which i feel comfortable in
7051265 i always enjoy playing with the big lad he is a class act
7051266 when he played at the oval his first over back gave the side a lift
7051267 when you have someone bowling that quick with that much bounce and you are into the opposition everyone gets a lift from it
7051268 it is nice to see him playing one day cricket again and smiling
7051269 coming back was up to him it was his decision but if he carries on the way he is doing he is going to help the sides success
7051270 the thought that god would promote something that would ensure that the vast majority of his children would never again be able to dwell in his presence is incomprehensible and the assumption that our mother in heaven would idly sit back and allow such a guaranteed flop to eternally strip her of any interaction with her spirit offspring is equally unfathomable such could not and did not happen
7051271 god is so merciful surely he will save us all eventually if we do not gain the celestial kingdom now eventually we will so why worry
7051272 and they shall be servants of the most high but where god and christ dwell they cannot come worlds without end
7051273 therefore when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are appointed angels in heaven which angels are ministering servants to minister for those who are worthy of a far more and an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory
7051274 ill worry about consequences later and seek out all my self gratifications now
7051275 that which invites men to do good and believe in christ is of god that which invites not to do good is not of god
7051276 disney used pat powers cinephone system created by powers using lee de forests phonofilm system without giving de forest any credit
7051277 the film has been the center of a variety of controversies regarding copyright the copyright of the film has been repeatedly extended by acts of the united states congress however recent evidence suggests that the film may be in the public domain due to technicalities related to the original copyright notice
7051278 film credits from the 1920s revealed imprecision in copyright claims that some experts say could invalidate disneys long held copyright though a disney lawyer dismissed that idea as frivolous
7051279 although studio executives are not yet hurling themselves from the parapets of sleeping beautys castle the unexpected discovery raises an intriguing question is it possible that mickey mouse now belongs to the world and that his likeness is usable by anybody for anything
7051280 for the record any knock offs would have to make clear that they did not come from disney or else risk violating the separate laws that protect trademarks and the potentially free mickey is not the most current or familiar version of the famous mouse
7051281 copyright questions apply to an older incarnation a rendition of mickey still recognizable but slightly different original mickey the star of the first synchronized sound cartoon steamboat willie and other early classics had longer arms smaller ears and a more pointy nose
7051282 longtime disney devotee dared awake the dragon in the disney companys powerful legal department
7051283 gregory s brown 51 a former disney researcher who has lived in the same one bedroom apartment in hollywood for two decades seems an unlikely giant killer
7051284 thin pale and bespectacled he looks the part of an obsessive archivist he has worked little since a heart attack in 1998 getting by mostly on disability payments
7051285 in particular the original films copyright notice had two additional names between disney and the copyright statement
7051286 lauren vanpelt took up the challenge and produced a paper agreeing with browns claim
7051287 she posted her project on the web in 1999 disney later threatened to sue a georgetown university law student who wrote a paper confirming browns claims
7051288 conducting a due diligence assessment of harveys assets brown discovered arvey had failed to renew copyrights covering the companys ghosts
7051289 now armed with knowledge about the frequency and implications of copyright confusion brown launched a business venture exploiting some of that murkiness
7051290 he would market recreated animation cels from a 1933 mickey mouse short called the mad doctor brown had discovered that the disneys failed to renew copyright claims on that film
7051291 but the disney company sued so quickly that brown never sold a cel although the mad doctor was indeed out of copyright that long ago oversight had not freed mickey whose ostensible copyright protection predated the short
7051292 brown lost worse he was clobbered with a 500 000 judgment
7051293 one of walt disneys earliest creations was oswald the lucky rabbit
7051294 after the cartoon proved popular a new york distributor used an advantage in its contract to take control of oswald then hired away many of disneys artists mickey was the product of a desperate comeback attempt by walt and his brother
7051295 the companys aggression in copyright cases has verged on the cartoonish
7051296 continues to be charmed by the genius behind mickey mouse
7051297 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee

7051300 when the rain is pouring down and my heart is hurting you will be always around this i know for certain
7051301 the greenhouse effect is the rise in temperature that the earth experiences because certain gases in the atmosphere water vapor carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane for example trap energy from the sun without these gases heat would escape back into space and earths average temperature would be about 60 f 33 c colder
7051302 for decades human factories and cars have spewed billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere many scientists fear that the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases have prevented additional thermal radiation from leaving the earth in essence these gases are trapping excess heat in the earths atmosphere in much the same way that a windshield traps solar energy that enters a car
7051303 there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities
7051304 if i had to put a figure on it i would say that it is 60 percent our fault the remaining 40 percent is due to natural causes
7051305 as regards the wicked they will be cut off from the very earth and as for the treacherous they will be torn away from it
7051306 great tribulation such as has not occurred since the worlds beginning until now no nor will occur again

7051309 its more than a function hes a man i have learned to appreciate
7051310 we did okay to a certain extent against villa but we need to be a bit more resolute
7051311 we have to make sure the pattern of play and the way we approach games is correct not just for 45 minutes or 60 minutes but for 90 minutes
7051312 that is what we are striving to achieve it is early days though and these things can take time
7051313 we worked extremely hard in pre season and are looking for a positive result from our first league game at home
7051314 i understand jo will be ready to train on monday so he will go to denmark
7051315 we have lost him for quite some time now and he has not had a great deal of football recently either which is a concern for us
7051316 you do hope that while they are away that they will get good game time under his belt
7051317 he has been in competitive games but going in for 10 15 minutes a time is not the ideal preparation for premier league games so it might take a little bit of time to get up to speed
7051318 but needs must and i think he will be involved with us very very quickly
7051319 why do i have to protect myself against identity theft
7051320 in the last 6 olympic games there is an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
7051321 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
7051322 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy
7051323 the enormous changes that took place in china over the past 30 years have given people of the world more imagination and expectation about china
7051324 the gold in beijing this year will won by savvy investors as well as athletes
7051325 would be wise to follow their financial markets as well

7051335 when interest rates went up they borrowed money to keep up the mortgage payments
7051336 the speeding no one thinks big of you campaign has not only broken through the youth barrier but has been embraced by popular youth culture
7051337 young drivers dont put themselves in that image they think thats all about bad drivers but the pinkie gesture resonates more with acting stupidly it is about cultural and peer pressure
7051338 our public service ceos manage some of the largest organisations in queensland with workforces of up to 80 000 people
7051339 ceos are held to high standards of accountability for the delivery of these services and programs
7051340 some departments in queensland are so small that they would only at best be divisions of departments in victoria or the federal government yet in queensland each has its own highly paid dg
7051341 our natural environment is the best in the country but while our elite athletes are the envy of the world the rest of us are falling behind
7051342 unlike the biggest loser television show this competition is not just about losing weight it is about encouraging queensland communities to become healthier across the board
7051343 thats why this 1 million government grant will be up for grabs every year for the town that is most successful in turning on a healthy revolution in its community
7051344 for instance diabetes is expected to become the single biggest cause of illness and early death in 15 years leaving thousands of queenslanders with poorer quality of life
7051345 a lbeit a cynic who is constantly confounded by the truth
7051346 for example all new residential units could have a free public transit pass for a year built into the selling price
7051347 at a new development of 250 apartments in floridorf vienna the developers provided only 25 car parking spaces all of which were dedicated to car clubs
7051348 each new tenant was offered a years free membership to the scheme and 57 per cent took up the offer the reduction in parking saved the developer 9 per cent of the total construction budget

7051350 education alerts is a way without being overly intrusive to interact with students who may not remember us very well and it gets them back into thinking about our school
7051351 education alerts identifies and contacts prospects that previously showed interest and rekindles interest without overextending our marketing department as a result weve captured a much larger percentage of students who we originally deemed as losses
7051352 while most career school owners presidents and marketing directors understand the value of recycling their inactive student leads few have the internal resources to mine the gold in their prospect databases
7051353 as the cost to keep the student lead pipeline full with quality student leads continues to increase across all media broadcast print and search engine advertising its critical for schools to recycle their inactive student leads thats where education alerts fits into a schools lead generation strategy

7051442 aunque es necesario que la gente sepa las consecuencias de todo lo que consume parece algo excesivo culpabilizar a la televisi n de todos los males de los menores de 3 a os
7051443 es como una pistola si se mata con ella no se le acusa a la pistola sino al asesino si los ni os se agitan con la televisi n y los padres lo permiten parece claro que la responsabilidad es fundamentalmente de los padres

7051462 kristy kiernans matters of faith was so good and true and real that i forgot i was reading a book i felt as though i was standing helplessly beside good people whose ordinary family life is slowly inexorably tumbling into the darkness of the unknown
7051463 in this tense well paced novel about belief kiernan explores what happens when faith and love test the limits of family fealty kiernan movingly portrays a 20 year old marriage gone flat and torn apart by crisis a troubled son a daughter hovering between life and death and the hard to discern boundaries between true faith and unhealthy fanaticism she handles her difficult material respectfully most interesting is her portrayal of the well meaning traps parents fall into when encouraging open ended exploration of faith without context or choosing to remain silent the thoughtful themes interesting characters and page turning drama of this novel will likely make it a book club favorite

7051475 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it

7051578 i feel like the monies are being well spent on the students
7051579 we think that the current leadership is not serving the interest of the students and the community
7051580 we think its a disastrous situation for rialto and feel the district can do much better for the community
7051581 i understand the role of a union is to represent its members but i am disappointed that theyve chosen such a tactic
7051582 its a disservice to the community to the district and to the staff which includes teachers

7051672 a ten per cent increase is possible if the fuel prices do not come down significantly the indian aviation industry has suffered a collective loss of about one billion us dollars last year
7051673 we see things improving but we are not at all out of the woods
7051674 the room to manoeuvre at this moment is limited any marginal changes in the prices will not enable us to make any significant move
7051675 marginal and that reduction is not reflected in the prices charged by our fuel companies you have the currency effect also we will see how oil companies price aviation turbine fuel atf by the end of this month or the first week of next month

7051682 he needs to get fit first and then we will sort something
7051683 the fact is he needs to play football and get 10 to 15 games under his belt
7051684 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7051685 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7051686 i am fully aware he has got his thing on september 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand
7051687 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
7051688 but at the moment it is looking unlikely just because of the work he has missed
7051689 i still need more training and more matches under my belt
7051690 i got another 55 minutes or so for england and im not feeling any injury so im getting closer and need those minutes on the pitch

7051703 we had such a fantastic time in your apartment it made our holiday perfect
7051704 we were called to an incident on argyle street and met three men at the scene
7051705 it was pretty clear that they were under the influence of something
7051706 they were waiting on a taxi and the injured man who had blood on his face asked if the other two could get in the ambulance with him
7051707 when we refused he became verbally and physically abusive towards us the taxi arrived at the scene and i think that the injured party thought that it was the police he approached me and spat blood in my face
7051708 i came to work here from bangor and ive worked in omagh before but this is the first time i have been attacked like this
7051709 young people become a bit of an unknown quantity when under the influence of drugs
7051710 when there is a blood incident like this without a medical history of the person involved there is a possibility of the victim catching a virus such as hepatitis or hiv
7051711 i was taken to have my eye tested and our ambulance was stood down for a period
7051712 there are two ambulances on call in the city one in the waterside and one in the city side
7051713 this left us with one ambulance on call from 3am right through the morning
7051714 you try to prepare yourself for incidents like this but when it comes it comes as a bit of a shock
7051715 this sort of behaviour raises its ugly head from time to time
7051716 we regularly hear of hospital staff being targeted and earlier this month firemen came under attack in the city
7051717 in relation to ambulance cover an attack like this could potentially have a serious impact on someone who needs emergency care as the victim has to come off duty for a period of time
7051718 luckily this didnt happen after the latest incident but its unfortunate that people stretch our resources in this way

7051729 i am also reminded of zi xiao liangs scientology pwned tigdb although this is decidedly a more dangerous and ambitious venture
7051730 scientologists will sue anyone who messes with them muslims probably wont

7051741 i expected him to make them before i dont think we should over dramatise it all there are more important things for us right now
7051742 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7051743 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7051744 new york is one of my favourite cities i think its a great atmosphere i love the tournament as well the atmosphere is different to all the other grand slams

7051760 whenever i was speaking to ben he was always talking about starting a family
7051761 i dont think you could find a couple that suited each other better
7051762 she was good for him in the way that he was always a shell be right sort of guy she would be the one who would say no ben it wont be right this time this is how weve got to do it she was the commonsense one
7051763 there were periods where she was quite distressed about what was happening with him
7051764 she definitely had ups and downs as the weeks went by but she comes across as a very strong person
7051765 when we first saw him he was not going to stay in bed he wanted to come and open the door for us
7051766 you could see the virus was starting to have an effect just on his facial features he didnt have the perky smile that he would normally have
7051767 but he was still the same ben he was in hospital but he was wanting to know what was happening with our lives
7051768 he was concerned about the clinic and he wanted to know what was happening with the quarantine
7051769 he never asked why did this happen to me he just wanted to fight it
7051770 he was always very caring towards everyone he met everyone liked him
7051771 he was one of the most popular people in the clinic because he was so easy to get along with
7051772 he always wanted to be sure he was providing the best service for his clients and the horse
7051773 he always wanted to be a better vet every time he came to work
7051774 he was just the type of guy you want your boys to grow up to be and your daughter to marry
7051775 he was a lovely guy he was a gentlemen and thats why this has been so unfair
7051776 i am aware that there is a high level of public interest in hendra which is why i have asked for an independent review of the departments emergency response
7051777 queenslanders can be assured that this review will be properly focused and they can expect that those responsible will identify how and where improvements can be made
7051778 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7051779 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7051780 cheney has essentially been called a co president or by some critics a secret president
7051781 the president of vice president has become much more powerful and certainly anyone who would be looking at taking the number two position on the ticket would certainly think i might have a broader portfolio i might have the opportunity to have a real impact on the administration policies
7051782 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
7051783 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future

7051853 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7051854 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7051855 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7051856 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7051857 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7051858 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7051859 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7051860 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7051861 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7051862 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7051863 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7051864 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7051865 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7051866 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7051867 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7051868 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7051869 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7051870 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7051871 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7051872 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7051873 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7051874 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7051875 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted delivery schedules have slipped contractor employees have been laid off
7051876 the end result is a current it system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
7051877 verbandsbeschwerderecht schluss mit der verhinderungspolitik mehr wachstum f r die schweiz
7051878 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7051879 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7051880 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7051881 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7051882 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7051883 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7051884 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump
7051885 nais this is not the same as omitting the t sound altogether since plei nevertheless authors who want to show a non standard pronunciation by manipulating the spelling tend to write it with an apostrophe
7051886 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7051887 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7051888 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7051889 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7051890 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7051891 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7051892 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7051893 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7051894 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7051895 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7051896 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7051897 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7051898 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7051899 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7051900 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7051901 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7051902 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7051903 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7051904 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7051905 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7051906 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7051907 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7051908 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7051909 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7051910 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7051911 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7051912 da minha aldeia vejo quanto da terra se pode ver no universo
7051913 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7051914 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7051915 i am not running for vice president i would i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is i would much prefer to stay as the chairman of the foreign relations committee then vice president
7051916 im not a monster im just ahead of the curve
7051917 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7051918 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7051919 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7051920 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7051921 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
7051922 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
7051923 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
7051924 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
7051925 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
7051926 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7051927 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7051928 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7051929 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7051930 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7051931 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7051932 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7051933 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7051934 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7051935 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7051936 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7051937 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7051938 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7051939 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7051940 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7051941 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7051942 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7051943 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7051944 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7051945 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7051946 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7051947 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7051948 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7051949 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7051950 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7051951 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7051952 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7051953 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7051954 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7051955 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7051956 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7051957 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7051958 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7051959 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7051960 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7051961 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7051962 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7051963 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7051964 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7051965 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7051966 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7051967 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7051968 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7051969 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7051970 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7051971 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7051972 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7051973 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7051974 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7051975 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7051976 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7051977 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7051978 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7051979 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7051980 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7051981 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7051982 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7051983 es ist schon ein paar rennen her als wir es geschafft haben in die top 10 zu kommen dies ist f r uns also ein gutes ergebnis
7051984 wir wollen nat rlich immer besser abschneiden aber dies zeigt dass wir einen schritt in die richtige richtung gemacht haben dass ist befriedigend
7051985 wir hatten eine bessere vorstellung davon wo wir uns verbessern mussten wir haben aus diesem grund diese ver nderungen vorgenommen die uns heute ein konkurrenzf higeres auto beschert haben f r das rennen haben wir eine gute strategie es ist also alles m glich der heutige tag war positiv was mir f r morgen die hoffnung auf punkte beschert
7051986 dies war f r uns ein gutes qualifying da beide autos dem mittelfeld nah sind
7051987 es war schade den dritten qualifying teil verpasst zu haben aber tats chlich ist der elfte platz kein schlechter ort um das rennen zu starten denn wir k nnen unsere benzin menge w hlen ich werde morgen auch auf der sauberen seite der strecke stehen alles in allem war dies f r uns also eine positive qualifying einheit
7051988 es ist gut zumindest ein auto im dritten qualifying teil zu haben den wir seit ein paar rennen verpasst haben
7051989 ungl cklicherweise verpasste kazuki seinen ersten qualifying teil nummer drei durch den kleinst m glichen abstand das wichtige ist nun uns auf das rennen vorzubereiten und sicherzustellen dass wir mit unserer strategie gl cklich sind wir freuen uns auf den morgigen tag
7051990 il mio maometto censurato ma non ho paura della fatwa
7051991 impegnatissima a partecipare a discussioni e interviste su un libro che non nemmeno stato pubblicato
7051992 e difficile perch le persone giudicano senza aver letto o avendo letto solo il prologo che si trova su internet
7051993 di aisha la moglie pi giovane e la preferita di maometto di una donna intelligente e spiritosa che diventa padrona di se stessa e supera i molti ostacoli legati alla condizione femminile nellantichit e in arabia saudita riuscendo persino a diventare la consigliera del profeta prima e dei suoi eredi poi
7051994 si parlato molto e a sproposito di questo non c nessuna scena di sesso in realt non potevo ignorare un passaggio fondamentale della storia e ho scelto di raccontarlo descrivendo quello che aisha ha provato dopo non ci che successo durante
7051995 ho seguito un corso di storia dellislam e letto tutto quello che potevo volumi scritti da religiosi musulmani da professori di cultura islamica ma anche testi di studiosi occidentali e una biografia di maometto che risale al 14esimo secolo
7051996 e stato l11 settembre ad avvicinarmi volevo capire questa cultura mi capitato di incontrare la figura di aisha e mi sono appassionata
7051997 volevo raccontare la sua storia condividerla pochi occidentali la conoscono e poi speravo di creare un ponte tra la cultura islamica e quella occidentale adesso ho finito anche il seguito del libro in cui racconto la vita di aisha dopo la morte di maometto
7051998 qualcuno si detto interessato ma per ora non ci sono accordi per il romanzo verr pubblicato in spagnolo nella primavera del 2009 e sono stata contattata anche da alcune case editrici italiane
7051999 beh ero sbigottita ho scritto in maniera rispettosa sia dellislam che delle donne che di maometto e stato scioccante scoprire che alla random house sono arrivate segnalazioni da parte di alcuni studiosi di possibili attacchi terroristici
7052000 non sono preoccupata il libro ha creato dibattito ma le discussioni non comportano per forza violenza
7052001 non darei ai giornalisti stralci del libro da pubblicare leggerne solo una parte non rende un ritratto autentico del libro
7052002 tutti me lo chiedono ma la risposta no altrimenti non avrei scritto the jewel of medina dopo tutto solo un romanzo in cui ho preso la figura storica di aisha e lho resa un personaggio di finzione non sar perfetto forse ma sono orgogliosa di quel che ho scritto
7052003 we are determined to make sure that only properly licensed drivers operate in bournemouth
7052004 die georgischen streitkr fte sollen sich auf ihre blichen stationierungsorte zur ckziehen

7052008 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7052009 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7052010 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7052011 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7052012 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7052013 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7052014 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7052015 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7052016 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7052017 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7052018 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7052019 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7052020 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7052021 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7052022 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7052023 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7052024 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7052025 i work as the first point of contact for all the delegates all the vips
7052026 a lot of the preparation was working for the democratic party and working in different capacities in different campaigns
7052027 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7052028 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7052029 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7052030 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7052031 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7052032 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7052033 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7052034 ole ole ole oleeeeeeeeeee y el cielito lindo no faltaron era increible la cantidad de mexicanos que coreaban y alentaban a nuestra atleta lleg el momento del himno y el estruendo en las voces de los mexicanos volvi a alegrar y a demostrar el alcance y la potencia de nuestro pa s
7052035 its the trend of the market cruise shipping is the fastest growing tourism sector in the world and we have a very active marketing strategy to get the ships to come here
7052036 i would like to attract more cruise ships to devonport and once things settle down here myself and the general manager ian mccallum will be making appointments and meeting with various cruise companies
7052037 but the larger ships we cant get them in theyve got the deep sea port in burnie which is good because i like to think that we benefit as a region
7052038 there are usually about 15 to 25 coaches heading out from burnie and they go as far west as woolnorth down to cradle mountain and across to devonport and deloraine
7052039 in terms of the final result here i think that there is uncertainty
7052040 premier david bartlett and mr aird should be showing support for the mill at this crucial time while also declaring to investors that tasmania is and will continue to be a great place to invest and do business
7052041 tasmanians are hearing mixed messages from the premier and depending on his audience the premiers support for the project varies greatly
7052042 what does premier david bartlett have to do to rectify this situation
7052043 he has to detach himself his government and the public purse from gunns and the logging industry
7052044 think of this day and this moment and remember it for the rest of your lives because this is the day that the tasmanian people have turned around
7052045 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
7052046 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
7052047 a causa dellelevata stagionalit e deperibilit dei prodotti o a fronte di una scarsa organizzazione della produzione agricola
7052048 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
7052049 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
7052050 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
7052051 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
7052052 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola verso altri mercati di sbocco
7052053 manca un sistema informatico adeguato sia per la rilevazione dei prezzi sia per garantire la tracciabilit dei prodotti
7052054 che consente di accrescere il grado di concorrenza tra gli operatori oltre a offrire un maggior servizio allutenza
7052055 according to multiple sources there is no backside to the existing contract between favre and the jets
7052056 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7052057 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu
7052058 now they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region
7052059 if only i could get 30 seconds with that car it would change my life
7052060 oh youre like this only because this is the closest youve ever been to something thats been so close to adam wests ass
7052061 infrastructure investment has received more attention in recent years because of increased delays from road and air congestion high profile infrastructure failures and rising concerns about energy security and climate change the united states now has the opportunity to channel public concern and frustration into a national infrastructure strategy that promotes infrastructure as a central com ponent of long term broadly shared growth while increased spending on infrastructure is likely to be needed this paper emphasizes the large gains that could be reaped by using existing infrastruc ture more efficiently and by making better decisions about how to invest in infrastructure for physical infrastructure we recommend establishing pricing mechanisms such as road conges tion fees and air traffic control fees to make users bear the costs of their infrastructure use more fully at least part of the revenues from these fees should be used to offset their potential adverse distributional effects the federal government can also promote better decisionmaking about new investments by removing distortions in its own policies and providing more flexibility in exchange for accountability by states and localities for telecommunications infrastructure we propose that the government make better use of the wireless spectrum by facilitating sales and leases of unused spectrum and by introducing more flexibility in its policy of interference prevention further the government should consider targeted cost effective subsidies to encourage private firms to expand high speed internet access to unserved rural areas
7052062 stop fremi tutti non facciamoci prendere da queste cose che siamo in vacanza
7052063 potevo scegliere una cosa leggermente meno complicata tanto per cambiare
7052064 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7052065 the first mainstream african american candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7052066 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7052067 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7052068 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there

7052095 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7052096 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7052097 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7052098 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7052099 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7052100 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7052101 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7052102 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7052103 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7052104 i absolutely dont know what happened but on the face of it two fine people were murdered

7052108 we have been involved in extensive negotiations with plaintiffs and we hope we can reach a group resolution of the claims
7052109 based on advice from legal counsel and on prayerful reflection over this most difficult matter i believe that this settlement while costly is a responsible resolution for these individuals and their families and in the best interest of the diocese
7052110 of those 47 plaintiffs i dont know which ones im concerned with or which ones are concerned with me
7052111 in depositions that were made some of my accusers admitted that they didnt even know me

7052123 he took ownership when someone made a scene that they were handing out literature that basically was the gospel of luke and they realized that these were evangelicals an adult accused them of doing proselytism there in greece and thats illegal
7052124 evangelical christians are in great minority in greece less than two tenths of a percent are evangelicals and they are looked down upon by the typical orthodox greek who sees them really as a heretic
7052125 our hope is that while hes in china hell raise the issue of religious freedom and be an advocate for persecuted christians he has raised that issue in the past and we hope he will do it during this olympic time as well
7052126 the king abdullah is saying christians and muslims need to get along better then look at whats happening at home this just shows and exposes the heart of saudi beliefs they can spend money and spin things and they can do pr but what matters is what happens at home
7052127 there is a tremendous hunger for bibles in the persecuted church you could see up to 30 people sharing one bible they tear off little pieces and each person has like one book one of our big drives is to get bibles into the hands of these guys
7052128 they are on the run because of the olympic games the government did not like them in beijing or some of the cities where some of the events are being held and officials were afraid christians would meet with the media and say something they wouldnt like
7052129 most of them are more quiet particularly those in cities where olympic events are being held many of them were warned by the authorities not to do anything until after the olympic games
7052130 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7052131 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7052132 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7052133 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7052134 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

7052138 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7052139 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7052140 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7052141 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7052142 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7052143 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7052144 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7052145 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7052146 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7052147 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7052148 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7052149 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7052150 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7052151 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

7052174 we have three lifts in our first lap and we nailed all of them so that gave me the fire for the whole rest of the routine it was awesome the scores we really cant control them we can only do our best
7052175 were not swimming for a score were swimming for art were swimming for everything we put into the whole year and were swimming for an overall great performance thats memorable
7052176 our goal was to have a standing ovation when we were done and im pretty sure i saw some people standing up there so i think we accomplished our goal
7052177 you only see what happens outside of the water but its a lot of work to get those girls out of the water
7052178 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
7052179 if we give back 400 acres of land to farmers in singur the nano project will have to be scrapped
7052180 the greatest challenge to u s security and world stability today
7052181 saw the glamour of it i think he really got smitten with the celebrity of power
7052182 the constitution of the united states designates the president of the united states as commander in chief the congress of the united states plays a role and i believe that this process we are about to embark on is the appropriate role that congress should carry out its responsibilities but at the end of the day the final most serious responsibility of sending young american men and women into harms way rests with the president of the united states
7052183 these are facts of life in which the united states relationship with russia thank goodness for 16 years has worked steadily toward nonproliferation and toward reduction of threats to the u s not to georgia but to the u s now we have got to keep our eye on the ball this doesnt excuse brutal actions by the russians they took advantage of a situation in which we were far away but at the same time we need an agenda with russia even as we are discussing the agenda with georgia
7052184 we are not going to distribute the footage we are not doing these kinds of things everything is good what are you going to do with the footage see what the serbians already saw it is clarified for us beyond any doubt hes the winner in any way hes the winner no doubt even if you could see the pictures i dont know how you could use them
7052185 if you ask me it should be accepted and we should move on ive accepted defeat and theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
7052186 what are you afraid of what do you have to hide from an actual frame by frame analysis except the victory of cavic over phelps you sound like a liar caught in a clumsy cover up you dont make decisions for me big brother
7052187 we have no opinion on arab arab conflicts like your border disagreement with kuwait

7052210 do you have a special book that no other site has
7052211 dit was eigenlijk gewoon een hele goede kwalificatie voor ons bmw zijnde de snelheid van ons is hier erg goed al missen we nog flink wat ten opzichte van ferrari en mclaren helaas hebben we wat pech gehad in de vorige races en ook de kwalificaties daarvan maar ik ben blij hier weer terug te zijn hier horen we te staan met dit team
7052212 de regen heeft eigenlijk deze sessie niet veel invloed gehad op ons coureurs en onze bolides alleen aan het einde van het circuit was het een beetje te merken daar moest je echt wel wat inhouden de regen van vannacht heeft het gripniveau vermindert helaas
7052213 ik heb er zin in morgen valencia is een leuke stad en dat vind ik ook van het circuit ik kan hier wel van genieten
7052214 experience matters to the american people and i recognize that i have none
7052215 e un bel ripartire se stiamo a giocarci una coppa con linter segno che abbiamo fatto molto bene nella stagione passata meritiamo questo tipo di serate nonostante le difficolt allinizio di preparazione la roma pronta per il confronto
7052216 noi come rispetto al presidente noi non possiamo che dargli il massimo dellimpegno noi gli dedicheremo questo sempre nel rispetto delle regole prima limpegno poi si vede
7052217 gli abbiamo chiesto se fosse stato disponibile per una situazione come la nostra cera ci ha fatto piacere ma le differenze sono incolmabili tenteremo di completare la squadra per gli impegni che saranno a lungo termine comunque noi i calciatori buoni ce li avevamo gi da prima
7052218 si cerca di stare attenti a quelle che sono le qualit del calciatore per far funzionare tutto anche il giocatore si deve sacrificare per le necessit della squadra lo abbiamo preso perch pu ricoprire pi ruoli e veloce e potente i buoni calciatori alla fine rendono
7052219 se si va a valutare quello che fa mourinho non credo che sar un problema per i suoi calciatori esprimersi in unamichevole ha giocato con ill 4 4 2 con adriano e ibra su francesco dobbiamo tenere in considerazione le sue condizioni e valutare giorno dopo giorno
7052220 e positivo che il ragazzo abbia questa voglia ma il ragazzo deve essere messo in condizione di dare un apporto per la squadra la prima valutazione sta allallenatore e ora non in condizione di dare un contributo alla squadra
7052221 anche lei smania riferito al cronista ndr ma bisogna vedere anche la sua condizione se si vuol vincere importante il comportamento non chi gioca o chi no
7052222 c anche vucinic che la prima punta la sapr fare c francesco valuteremo cosa sapr essere pi utile alla squadra
7052223 e stata sempre una nostra caratteristica di trovare calciatori duttili e di livello ladattabilit pu rappresentare un vantaggio per noi
7052224 e chiaro che riise e baptista da questo punto di vista qualcosa in pi ci danno
7052225 io non ho cercato di isolarla da quanto accaduto era giusto cos che i giocatori partecipassero a questo sentimento collettivo abbiamo visto che passione e trasporto c con il gruppo
7052226 cicinho non stato contento delle distribuzione delle casacche stamattina in allenamento ha detto che cos non gli sta bene ha qualcosa da chiarire e lo far con tranquillit a casa

7052253 you must never depend on one person i dont think we would have had the success initially without nigel but we are onto our eighth season it feels like its going to be a different show this year because of it and we will see whether thats an advantage or a negative
7052254 we cannot officially say either way until tests are done
7052255 seeing the country and getting to sing every night has been awesome im having a blast
7052256 were not trying to tell someone who to vote for

7052258 and what is the great thing about it is the fact that they are all live in utah
7052259 its really crazy i got a small taste of it when i was home last but nothing like this
7052260 with nigel there it became too much of a crowd and he is a very good producer but i think now he has stepped down i probably will get more involved i already have to be honest with you
7052261 we have got some ideas which are definitely going to give the show a little bit more jeopardy than we have had in the past
7052262 i think it could be just more interesting and controversial than we did last year and that will change

7052276 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend
7052277 my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
7052278 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid
7052279 our free practice pace was genuine and we have definitely made some improvements to the car over the break and here this week today i felt we could have had one car in the top ten rubens has been struggling with the car all day and we never really managed to overcome those problems jenson however had the car working very well as we saw with his first run in qualifying when he was using the prime tyre he then switched to option tyres but they didnt work at all for him and he could not match his early time with the mid pack being so close he was just squeezed out of q2 contention

7052299 its just absurd for him to think that any of us would prevent him from having the right to dissent in a case where the courts issued an opinion
7052300 ive done it in several cases and other justices have too
7052301 i think it is unprecedented for a majority to quiet the vote of a justice because they dont like what he is saying on a dissent a justice has a constitutional right to explain his vote they are all equal and they cant muzzle a justice for that
7052302 my only comment would be that the concern here was that justice diaz was not dissenting to the order and in fact agreed with it but rather was expressing his opinion on issues which were pending in the case but which were not before the court at this time the concern is if the case is later appealed his opinion of those issues has already been published to the public i dont think thats appropriate
7052303 ive been on the court four and a half years and ive never had anyone request to attach a statement to the lower court
7052304 i thought it would be inappropriate to include any statement and to do anything other than send it back to the trial court
7052305 i felt with some of the issues that it would be premature to rule on those issues because the record was not complete

7052307 ik heb voor de eneco tour een goed gesprek gehad met dirk
7052308 ik heb niet graag dat iemand na n jaar vertrekt
7052309 bt would like you to know that it does not wish to profit from this type of problem bt takes only 1 85 per 100 worth of calls the remaining revenue going to the service provider and bt has pledged to donate its share of revenue to childline
7052310 i had a hunch he was dodgy but i have no hard evidence he broke in he just came back with some cash all i did was drive him down to your place while you werent in and i know the geezer may be a bit of a crook but i have no proof the money he keeps coming back with is nicked so im just gonna keep netting my cut and then pass it on to charity
7052311 if verwaayen and bt took legal advice that charitable donations somehow exonerate them then they are living in a fools paradise
7052312 if bt passes money on to bad guys when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the money is the proceeds of crime it is potentially guilty of a crime
7052313 bt could be open to the charge of being involved in money laundering if at any stage it knows or suspects customers are victims of a premium rate scam
7052314 bt had been receiving complaints about dialler fraud for at least two years
7052315 if it had only received a few dozen that may not have indicated something was a miss perhaps a few hundred might have tipped the balance but what a conclusion other than some kind of criminal activity can a reasonable person make after more than 80 000 complaints
7052316 with tens of thousands of people around the country suffering the same fate bt was possibly handling millions of pounds worth of money that could be dirty i looked at redstone communications in 2002 the company nearly went broke and was forced to sell its national telecom network to bt today redstone resells products on behalf of bt which means bt has an interest in redstone making bts claim that it only has a 1 85 stake in premium rate calls rather less than the whole story
7052317 which he blamed on a rogue internet dialler on his computer
7052318 the ex gratia payment in no way implied bt was at fault or liable for the charges
7052319 to stop computers using numbers not on a users pre approved list
7052320 early warning system which will alert bt customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills
7052321 the company said more than 2 000 customers a day were downloading the free software it was offering but thousands of customers would still have to pay huge phone bills racked up after their computers were infected
7052322 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7052323 the deliberate decision to deprive an innocent human being of his life is always morally evil and can never be licit either as an end in itself or as a means to a good end
7052324 nothing and no one can in any way permit the killing of an innocent human being whether a fetus or an embryo an infant or an adult an old person or one suffering from an incurable disease or a person who is dying furthermore no one is permitted to ask for this act of killing either for himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care nor can he or she consent to it either explicitly or implicitly nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action
7052325 as far as the right to life is concerned every innocent human being is absolutely equal to all others
7052326 there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone it makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the poorest of the poor on the face of the earth before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal

7052333 with couples today struggling with the average males declining sperm count the low libido levels caused by the increasing use of psychotropic drugs and the low supply of adoptable children both domestically and internationally angelinas lack of knowledge about her family size shows she is clearly a parental elitist
7052334 if you dont know how many kids you have then its not surprising that you might think that children are relatively easy to get
7052335 but if youre like millions of people struggling to get pregnant or adopt a child you might have a different perspective
7052336 angelina has rescued dozens of children from lives of poverty and despair
7052337 so she loses track of how many thats understandable this is a non issue we should be talking about promoting research to find out why sperm counts have fallen and to find renewable sources of children otherwise 10 years from now we wont have enough young people entering the work force to keep the social security fund intact and millions of old baby boomers could starve to death
7052338 es hat lange gedauert das ganze nach dem ersten rennen noch einmal zu toppen es hat heute unheimlich viel spa gemacht
7052339 im letzten qualifying h tte es noch einen tick weiter nach vorne gehen k nnen aber insgesamt war es ein guter tag
7052340 das erste was ich dachte war dass da jemand das tableau umgedreht hat das war dann nicht der fall als es vorbei war war das zweite was ich dachte das kann mir jetzt keiner nehmen
7052341 wir haben heute einige gro e berraschungen gesehen an erster stelle muss man sebastian vettel im toro rosso nennen sowohl das auto als auch der fahrer haben eine hervorragende vorstellung abgegeben und zwar nicht nur im qualifying sondern schon vorher heute morgen im freien training habe ich es noch nicht geglaubt aber sie waren ganz vorne dabei das freut mich sehr f r ihn
7052342 wir m ssen alles geben und d rfen uns keine fehler erlauben was eigentlich immer unser ziel ist bis jetzt haben wir das immer geschafft morgen ist ein langer tag ein langes rennen wenn wir am ende ein paar punkte mit nach hause nehmen d rfen dann w re das ein gro er erfolg

7052427 fact number one weve got more black men in prison than there are in college fact number two racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run

7052432 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7052433 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7052434 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7052435 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7052436 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7052437 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do

7052443 you tend to expect women to have more empathy and compassion but she didnt have it and when she seemed to it wasnt genuine
7052444 women have this idea that there is a sort of a sisterhood and we would hope that other women in the workplace would support us so when instead we are bullied by them it impacts us differently than when its coming from a male
7052445 because the employee has participated in any manner in an investigation proceeding or hearing
7052446 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7052447 for example an operating room nurse would assist in the performance of surgical procedures an employee whose task it is to clean the instruments used in a particular procedure would be considered to assist in the performance of the particular procedure
7052448 more reprehensible than would appear in a case involving economic harms only
7052449 to serve as a bar to a petition a contract must contain substantial terms and conditions of employment deemed sufficient to stabilize the bargaining relationship and must be signed by the parties
7052450 an agreement of more than 3 years duration is treated for contract bar purposes as expiring on its third anniversary date
7052451 1 a new agreement which embodies new terms and conditions or incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of the long term contract or 2 a written amendment which expressly reaffirms the long term agreement and indicates a clear intent on the part of the contracting parties to be bound for a specific period
7052452 clear that the parties did not intend for the mou to be a new agreement embodying new terms and conditions

7052458 might be unable to maintain high level contacts in the military intelligence community
7052459 the imposition of section 4311s discrimination requirement on a reemployment claim is not consistent with the plain language of sections 4312 and 4313
7052460 when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action
7052461 the claim accrues upon awareness of the actual injury i e the adverse employment action and not when the plaintiff suspects a legal wrong
7052462 i didnt fire them because they were women i fired them because they were trying to organize a union
7052463 the effect of such a comment was to make him question his identity and his decision to identify himself as a gay man in a straight world
7052464 this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
7052465 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
7052466 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
7052467 intended to place msg on notice of class wide allegations of race discrimination
7052468 the fact is about one in five u s adults has a criminal record and a disproportionate number of them are african americans and hispanics millions of people like ms clarke are motivated to return to the workforce after they pay their debt to society only to be turned away by employers with unfair hiring policies
7052469 this type of discrimination is a worsening problem for workers who have had a brush with the law and has a devastating effect on low income communities nationwide and particularly on minority communities
7052470 consider all individuals identified as belonging to two or more races as minorities
7052471 offered no proof that its operational needs justified the partial lockout
7052472 how can you sit at your table and eat a product packaged by a pregnant woman has been standing on her feet all day
7052473 high on the influential business lobbys annual list of job killer bills
7052474 unfairly presumed that small business owners are able to provide paid sick leave and dont want to
7052475 that couldnt be further from the truth the fact is that many want to but simply cant afford it
7052476 the person aggrieved demonstrates that the person did not have and should not have been expected to have enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of such discrimination on the date on which the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred
7052477 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
7052478 when our employees become proficient in english and assimilate into our society it benefits the company the community and the individual everyone gains

7052484 congratulations to felipe massa and ferrari for achieving the first pole position at this exciting new street course in the wonderful city of valencia
7052485 todays running was very interesting and we have seen the lap times continually improve as the drivers and teams learn the circuit and the track grip levels increased
7052486 thats why i couldnt improve my lap time which was for sure disappointing as the final run is always the quickest and i couldnt improve my time so last on the grid lets see for tomorrow
7052487 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7052488 i think a good effort from the team and giancarlo got the maximum out of the car in qualifying
7052489 its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating
7052490 there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7052491 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying
7052492 on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through

7052494 chi dice di avere in tasca la soluzione un genio o un mascalzone
7052495 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7052496 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us
7052497 wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying
7052498 we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today
7052499 we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7052500 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield
7052501 it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level
7052502 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7052503 a very disappointing qualifying we seem to have struggled for pace here all weekend despite having been very fast in the last sector and its frustrating for the drivers to finish in 14th and 17th an incident filled race is the only way were likely to achieve any points this weekend so well wait and see congratulations to toro rosso who got both their cars into the top ten for the first time
7052504 its the first race with our quick shift box and i think we have clearly taken a step forward in competitiveness and its nice to start outqualifying some of the works cars in the progress
7052505 i am very proud of the team now we are just 1 3 seconds from the fastest time of the day and really pushing to move into the midfield
7052506 for tomorrows race we know there will be a lot of incidents and potentially a lot of safety cars but we know our race pace is normally better than our qualifying pace so i think we can genuinely race with the midfield and look for a potential opportunity to score
7052507 i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3 seconds from the fastest time of the session
7052508 it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more
7052509 it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7052510 theres a touch of macabre ridiculousness to it i think weve seen a lot of attempts to make serious movies about serious things and it strikes me that we might be a little more artful about how we make a point these days
7052511 talks to our decision making ability in the world whether or not we can distinguish between good and evil and its done in a way more artful form than ramming something down someones throat which is why virulents appeals to me
7052512 was genau passiert ist kann ich noch nicht sagen aber mir ist hinten rechts der radtr ger gebrochen und die bremsschreibe ist weggeflogen
7052513 so habe ich aber immerhin die chance morgen jede menge autos zu berholen
7052514 thats when we said just give us our truck and leave the store
7052515 the last thing we want is to have a customer arrested we just wanted our truck back
7052516 its saying if you dont agree with us we will call the police and report you
7052517 putin and his associates in the kremlin dont accept post soviet realities
7052518 an independent georgia is critical to the international flow of oil
7052519 vices the most notorious seem to be the portion of this unhappy negro race idleness treachery revenge cruelty impudence stealing lying profanity debauchery nastiness and intemperance are said to have
7052520 rwandas population of about 8 million is dominated by the hutu tutsi and twa tribes in our culture there was no male circumcision
7052521 now the information is out there and i today find myself amazingly in agreement with marcus garvey the black huckster of equal rights
7052522 o ne particular argument requires careful attention the belief that negroes were descended from ham though particularly common in the first half of the nineteenth century this idea was actually very old
7052523 is the bible a book by a white god for white people
7052524 literary critics of the twentieth and twenty first century should not be allowed to write about novels of the nineteenth century because the nineteenth century novelists believed in the soul but the twentieth and twenty first century literary critics do not it is analogous to c s lewiss contention that someone who has an a priori belief that there are no such things as miracles should not be allowed to debate the subject of miracles and likewise those post christian whites who deny there is such a thing as race are not capable of understanding a white mans love for his race what they cant understand or feel themselves they simply condemn
7052525 spirit but over the shrill objections of the adl the splc the zionazis and all the rest of that tribe he is also a man and a man of one incarnated ethnicity that has
7052526 to be sure the incarnation meant that all those who were and are and will be consubstantial with christs humanity were effected by the union and compenetration of the divine and human natures in him they are in a sense compelled by the common human nature which they share with christ to a kind of natural or inevitable deification but to stop here would be to misunderstand the doctrine profoundly because men are not just individuations of human nature they are also irreducible concrete personal uniquenesses which have absolutely no analogies to anything or anyone else
7052527 n either the old covenant nor the new testament were legal agreements rather they were spousal relationships this was the great error into which the old israel fell and which the prophets warned them about israel
7052528 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh gen 2 25
7052529 the logos assumed the essence of a human being through the process of birth by taking it from human beings and he has given and continues to give human beings the essence of god through the process of birth or rebirth out of god
7052530 and christ became incarnate by the holy ghost of the virgin mary and was made man
7052531 t hese two interconnected and inseparable truths constitute christianity and are fundamental dogmas of the orthodox church which sings the following words troparion of the annunciation the age old mystery is revealed to us today and the son of god becomes a son of man in order that by partaking of what is worse he may impart to me of what is better
7052532 these writers argued that blacks belong to a race created before adam and from among whom the biblical villain cain found his wife cain by marrying one of these pre adamic peoples the reasoning goes became the progenitor of all black people
7052533 if artists who make statues and paint portraits of kings are held in high esteem will not god bless ten thousand times more those who reveal and beautify his royal image for man is the image of god
7052534 for sure it is always nice to be on the top after such a bad result especially how it happened
7052535 to have a problem with three laps to go with it completely in my pocket after such a difficult race its very nice to be here after the last problem being at the top
7052536 it is nice to start from pole position and you have more possibilities so lets try to do a great race tomorrow
7052537 we have a good car we showed in the last race but unfortunately sometimes these things can happen and we showed again here that we are competitive that is the most important thing the team did a great job today
7052538 starting on pole for the first time for sure is very nice and the track here is not very easy especially the surface which is a bit slippery so to make the perfect lap is a bit difficult
7052539 anyone from the office would be more relevant to my internets
7052540 ik ben super gelukkig want dit is gewoon het allerhoogste slechts n keer in de vier jaar zijn er olympische spelen en hoewel het dezelfde tegenstanders als bij een wk zijn heeft dit toch een extra dimensie
7052541 of ik dit verwacht had goh ik heb heel hard op mijn tanden moeten bijten en de verwachtingen moeten temperen toen ik haar twee weken terug in yantai zag springen toen wist ik dat ze hiertoe in staat was daarna heb ik gewoon aan wat technische zaken geschaafd en voor wat afleiding gezorgd in de wedstrijd moest ze lang achtervolgen maar we wisten dat 2 05 de cruciale hoogte was en net als zo vaak in het verleden toonde ze zich de beste onder druk ik besef dit echt nog niet goed want niet alleen mijn atlete maar ook mijn vriendin heeft goud gepakt ongelooflijk

7052546 for the past two weeks the worlds attention has been focused on china and the country has used the olympic games as an opportunity to announce its arrival as a major political and economic power
7052547 in one sense however these games have been an unqualified success
7052548 als tijdelijke voorzitter van de vn veiligheidsraad is onze open lijn met china op het hoogste niveau cruciaal
7052549 zoals in eerdere gesprekken heb ik ook nu weer gepleit voor een evenwichtige resolutie inzake zuid osseti die een duidelijk kader kan scheppen voor verdere vredeshandhaving en gesprekken op lange termijn gezien de uiteenlopende standpunten over de inhoud van een dergelijke resolutie binnen de vn veiligheidsraad met name tussen de vs en rusland kunnen de bemiddelende rol van belgi en het diplomatiek gewicht van china doorslaggevend zijn
7052550 we hebben met name over het conflict in oost congo en de situatie in darfoer van gedachten gewisseld
7052551 i thought he was sharp i thought he managed the offense the tempo was smart with the football was very good on third down i thought it was important for our offense to come out and establish some tempo and have some productivity early in the game we were able to do that and continue it for four quarters
7052552 some days you say did i make the right choice

7052557 there are only six standard softball courts in a city as large as beijing
7052558 even if the chinese team had won gold this time softball would still lack attention a month later
7052559 chinas public sport development is unbalanced generally especially between rural underdeveloped areas and urban prospering regions
7052560 an advantage of the chinese weightlifting team is our system in which we identify select and train athletic talents from primary to middle schools and from county level all the way to state level
7052561 how can you expect someone to be in the mood for sports when he cant even feed himself
7052562 our sports facilities are still far from meeting the growing needs of the public while physical education tends to be neglected in schooling
7052563 one of chinas goals in the games is to use the athletes inspiring performances as models for the public pursuit of sports and to promote sport for all
7052564 im delighted to see china get so many gold medals

7052584 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7052585 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7052586 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7052587 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7052588 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7052589 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7052590 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7052591 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7052592 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education

7052596 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
7052597 of course we watched it as closely as we did anything that was on our radar screen

7052686 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
7052687 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
7052688 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
7052689 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury

7052706 brett flew liz and her mother around the world so he could have them near him
7052707 all he ever spoke about was seeing his family so i am sure that cricket wasnt the reason for the breakup liz certainly seemed to enjoy the lifestyle
7052708 i have been told i cannot say anything and i wont comment about my family
7052709 ive been friends with liz for a long time i used to coach her brother at school
7052710 i have spoken to her recently five or six times in the last six months and liz had mentioned problems in passing conversations

7052723 then i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he who sat on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he judges and makes war his eyes were like a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns he had a name written that no one knew except himself he was clothed with a robe dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god john 1 1 14 and the armies in heaven clothed in fine linen white and clean followed him on white horses now out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should strike the nations and he himself will rule them with a rod of iron he himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written king of kings lord of lords

7052739 its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7052740 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7052741 a very disappointing qualifying we seem to have struggled for pace here all weekend despite having been very fast in the last sector and its frustrating for the drivers to finish in 14th and 17th an incident filled race is the only way were likely to achieve any points this weekend so well wait and see congratulations to toro rosso who got both their cars into the top ten for the first time
7052742 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7052743 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7052744 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7052745 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7052746 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank

7052764 ive had a significant problem with a number of trees both individual trees and trees in residential areas trees that are too tall and pose a danger to peoples houses

7052793 barack ha scelto joe biden come suo compagno elettorale afferma lannuncio joe biden porta grande esperienza di politica internazionale risultati impressionati di collaborazione bipartisan e un approccio diretto mirante a risolvere i problemi
7052794 biden stato il critico pi duro della mancanza di esperienza di obama ha ricordato ha denunciato lo scarso discernimento di barack obama sulle questioni di politica estera e sostenuto con forza quello di cui gli americani si stanno accorgendo velocemente che barack obama non pronto alla presidenza
7052795 un uomo di stato dedito al dovere eccezionalmente forte ed esperto

7052801 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7052802 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done we have our team but we also have our work cut out for us barack obama and joe biden are the leaders who will bring the change our country needs but they cant do it alone show your support for the obama biden ticket by making a donation today
7052803 therefore by the authority which christ conferred upon peter and his successors and in communion with the bishops of the catholic church i confirm that the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral
7052804 the deliberate decision to deprive an innocent human being of his life is always morally evil and can never be licit either as an end in itself or as a means to a good end
7052805 nothing and no one can in any way permit the killing of an innocent human being whether a fetus or an embryo an infant or an adult an old person or one suffering from an incurable disease or a person who is dying furthermore no one is permitted to ask for this act of killing either for himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care nor can he or she consent to it either explicitly or implicitly nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action
7052806 as far as the right to life is concerned every innocent human being is absolutely equal to all others
7052807 there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone it makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the poorest of the poor on the face of the earth before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal
7052808 my friend never indulge in any follies except those that will bring you great pleasure
7052809 the earlier 14th century slavic nationalism of the pole lithuanian and czech directed against the first onward march of the germans must be kept in mind when considering the recrudescence of the slavic nationalism in the 19th and 20th century again directed in large part against the germans

7052857 als tijdelijke voorzitter van de vn veiligheidsraad is onze open lijn met china op het hoogste niveau cruciaal
7052858 zoals in eerdere gesprekken heb ik ook nu weer gepleit voor een evenwichtige resolutie inzake zuid osseti die een duidelijk kader kan scheppen voor verdere vredeshandhaving en gesprekken op lange termijn gezien de uiteenlopende standpunten over de inhoud van een dergelijke resolutie binnen de vn veiligheidsraad met name tussen de vs en rusland kunnen de bemiddelende rol van belgi en het diplomatiek gewicht van china doorslaggevend zijn
7052859 we hebben met name over het conflict in oost congo en de situatie in darfoer van gedachten gewisseld
7052860 i dont think its your brothers imagination safi i can hear it too
7052861 it is probably a bush baby or somathing like that

7052874 this is so fun i wish i had a waterfall in my backgarden
7052875 you may think its my imagination but i heard some noises under ground when we were hunting
7052876 we came to say that we heard strange noises from under the ground
7052877 the lost city was the greatest city in indonesia long ago but it got destroyed in the wars now it is buried in the ground and whoever puts one foot on it they get swallowed into the ground
7052878 we will meet tomorrow but now it is the time for sleeping

7052882 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university

7052887 many women have strong preferences for certain styles of bra and wont buy anything else
7052888 they wont even look at anything that doesnt look like the sort of bra they are used to wearing
7052889 in sports bras for example many women wont buy a bra that resembles their everyday bra and does up at the back they think if it cant be pulled over their heads like a crop top then its not a real sports bra
7052890 but this is not true and many sports bras do up at the back in the same way as a traditional bra and do a very good job of supporting women
7052891 and some women cause breast pain or discomfort by not buying the right sized bra
7052892 theres a social stigma about certain sizes many women dont want to be seen as too small or too big and buy a bra that doesnt fit well in order to be what they consider to be a normal size
7052893 many other women are unaware that they are wearing a badly fitting bra or unknowingly wear the wrong bra size because they are routinely being sold ill fitting bras
7052894 whats all this junk on this desk in this attic who left all that here wait i think i remember some guy who was here at one point but maybe not
7052895 whats with all this coverage of swimming on nbc no one cares about swimming in this country
7052896 as a typical american with an embarrassing level of interest in celebrities
7052897 does it really matter who can swim from here to there a tenth of second faster than anyone else

7052973 whats good about us is if theres a guy on second with less than two outs were going to try and get them over for the next guy

7052975 guys are starting to understand that if we dont get the job done we have confidence in the guys behind us that they will pick us up

7052981 por m s que por eso me califiquen de antiguo
7052982 lo que pasa es que este grupo me dio muchas satisfacciones y no s lo los d as del partido sino que durante la semana porque siempre entregaron todo y como dije la otra vez con ellos me voy a irak y peleo con cualquiera
7052983 este es un buen equipo que busca siempre el arco de enfrente creo que hoy por ser una final no se jug mal pero si no tuvimos el mismo rendimiento de otros partidos al igual que ellos

7052994 i hope we continue to play the way we have been its not over yet anything can happen
7052995 but i was throwing my curve ball too much to some hitters and they capitalized you can only get away with things for so long
7052996 it feels real good to start hitting balls hard now hopefully it continues
7052997 its good to gain ground and to go out on a positive note before we come back to work after the all star break
7052998 the brooklyn team that i came up with in 1948 basically stayed together until 1958
7052999 it wasnt until we moved to los angeles that they started making changes on our off days the whole team would go on picnics together and our children were raised together in the ebbets field clubhouse before every game roy campanella would stand up and say the same team that won yesterday is the same team thats going to win today he put that in our minds and we knew thats what we had to do
7053000 even with all the world series experience and playing on all those great teams i think this is probably the cream on the top of everything
7053001 to be back on brooklyn soil after all these years and in a ballpark in brooklyn is very meaningful to me its almost like a fantasy
7053002 one is when we are going to die which is a good thing the other thing is we never know what we can really accomplish in life if everything went right and we push ourselves as hard as we can look at me i got more out of this skinny little body because i played on a great team and no one tried to change who i was you have to believe who you are is better than something you read about or something youve seen somewhere else
7053003 i was a skinny kid from indiana who could throw hard but to be picked out of the midwestern culture and placed in a big city like brooklyn was unbelievable
7053004 only to find out that bay ridge brooklyn was exactly like my hometown i knew the barber and the butcher and everyone knew me if i pitched a good game id come home from ebbets field and be in the middle of a street party with balloons in the trees and the whole nine yards it was amazing
7053005 we know that there is time left and were playing well
7053006 he was all over the place i think he was trying to do too much out there today
7053007 i was mad that he made the call before the pitch got to the catcher the ball was halfway there when he called it a strike i dont think it was right i was disappointed about it
7053008 were right in the middle of things for the wild card and i know these guys are playing hard
7053009 he can hit run and hes very smart i hope he keeps doing what hes doing
7053010 we knew going into this series that we had to play all nine innings in order to beat them
7053011 we know if we have our starting nine in there and our pitchers throw well we have a good chance of winning day in and day out
7053012 we take it pitch by pitch with the lineup that we have if we put together good games theres a good chance were going to win in the end
7053013 they had a pitcher knew to the league who didnt know carl and what he can hit
7053014 carls a pretty smart hitter he watched the at bats of the other guys knew what to look for and got it hes been carrying us for awhile too
7053015 before the seventh inning i said lets get them with the bloops
7053016 we were hitting the ball hard all night and had nothing to show for it we got a couple of breaks there we are a momentum team if a couple of guys get hits everyone feels confident
7053017 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
7053018 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
7053019 without the help of my teammates this isnt possible i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
7053020 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
7053021 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
7053022 this was one semi balding man who became a giant in his field a greater giant than all of the others combined he took risks he followed his heart we erect this statue of him in his honor were sorry he couldnt be here today he had a prior engagement interviewing barbara walters for his groundbreaking podcast show
7053023 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
7053024 were playing better baseball the pitching is starting to get better theyre getting the feeling of maybe we can get to the postseason everybody is feeding off each other right now
7053025 you just look for good pitches i put a good swing on it
7053026 thats one of my pet things as a manager i like to have a strong lower end of the lineup because sometimes the pitchers relax and think they are easy outs when they really arent
7053027 you try and soak up as much as you can
7053028 youre playing with carl everett and pete rose jr all the big leagues guys that have been there they know the game you try and learn from them
7053029 you know sometimes i forget to eat now ive forgotten my address my mothers maiden name and my keys but ive never forgotten to eat you have to be a special kind of stupid to forget to eat
7053030 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7053031 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7053032 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7053033 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7053034 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7053035 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
7053036 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
7053037 every track we tried to follow seemed to lead to a dead end
7053038 so i grabbed some bracken and made a bed for the night ruby kept me warm and i kept her warm its most likely she saved my life
7053039 i was shivering violently it was very very cold and it occurred to me that i might not make it but i put that thought out of my mind and told myself i am walking out of here and i am taking ruby with me
7053040 she headed off behind some thick undergrowth when we started walking in the morning
7053041 i kept calling out to her but she was gone
7053042 she saved my life so i wanted to return the favour and save her we just love her
7053043 its been pretty intense everythings worked out but it could have easily gone the other way
7053044 dom was more worried about ruby than himself he wanted to look for her instead of going to the hospital
7053045 if he didnt have the dog with him certainly the outcome could have been substantially more serious in fact who knows how serious the weather up there was well below zero
7053046 it came as a shock to a lot of his close friends
7053047 i only saw them four times a year and they were a loving couple
7053048 and he looks as if he has had a ski accident because he is all bandaged up with all his wounds but its a miracle he is alive and i do thank god for that
7053049 nobody knows how he managed to live for 11 days but he was saved in the nick of time
7053050 he was very unlucky that a storm blew in and washed out all the tracks
7053051 he couldnt find his way back because it got very dark he had to find a place to sleep in the dark hes had a terrible ordeal
7053052 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
7053053 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
7053054 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say

7053070 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7053071 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7053072 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7053073 he instilled disciplines in his ministers and because of this the country has taken a new direction in terms of development he tirelessly fought corruption and brought sanity in the running of government affairs
7053074 though he was not in good health from the time he became president he was dedicated to duty
7053075 it is bad that we have lost a leader who had a vision for the country said duncan silwimba a lusaka city gardener
7053076 as president of zambia president mwanawasa launched a sweeping anti corruption campaign and dedicated himself to improving the welfare of all zambians
7053077 a great loss to the african continent and for democracy
7053078 it is a great loss for democracy for which he was an ardent defender for all his life france salutes his memory vibrant with courage and freedom
7053079 for the deepening of regional economic integration intensification of regional infrastructure development as well as the restoration and strengthening of regional political unity and cohesion
7053080 it is true that there is political anxiety because investors do not know who will be the next leader and whether the current policies will continue
7053081 the key issue must be to ensure that there is stable management of the resources we currently have
7053082 because of the good economic fundamentals brought by the late president
7053083 it will be a mistake for any investors to consider pulling out
7053084 good policies put in place by this government have resulted in our economy being stable
7053085 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7053086 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

7053088 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7053089 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

7053096 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7053097 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7053098 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7053099 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7053100 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7053104 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7053105 mr ugarte podr a explicar cu l era la cuesti n a resolver por la corte en el caso mcculloch v maryland
7053106 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7053107 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7053108 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7053109 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7053110 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7053111 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7053112 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7053113 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7053114 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7053115 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7053116 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7053117 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7053118 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7053119 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7053120 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7053121 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7053122 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7053123 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7053124 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7053125 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7053126 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

7053128 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7053129 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7053130 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7053131 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7053132 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7053133 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7053134 procedi con calma in mezzo al rumore e alla fretta e ricorda quanta pace pu esserci nel silenzio
7053135 na enkele uren wandelen zou mijn roes toch uitgewerkt moeten zijn
7053136 je vertelde dat je niet wist waarop je joeg maar dat dit niet uitmaakte wat bedoel je daarmee
7053137 ik genoot ervan om doelloos te dwalen het wandelen zelf was aangenaam zonder zinvol te moeten zijn
7053138 nou ja ik was niet bezig met het nut van wat ik deed maar had gewoon zin in wat ik deed lekker bewegen frisse lucht mooie beelden de geur van het bos
7053139 nou de tijdloosheid ik kan dan uren wandelen zonder over iets na te denken als ik denk dan verlies ik gemakkelijk het contact met mijn omgeving tijdens de wandeling was dat anders ik denk zelfs niet na over de richting waarin ik loop maar struin overal dwars doorheen als ik niet weet waarheen ik wil dan doe ik niets tot er zich weer een impuls aandient gewoon doen wat in me opkomt in plaats van erover na te denken
7053140 ja want alles wat ik tegenkom is dan een verassing neem nou de ontdekking van beukenhof en de ontmoeting met dr dat had ik vooraf niet kunnen bedenken
7053141 na de wandeling en de ontmoetingen realiseerde ik me hoe bijzonder het was
7053142 nou mijn avontuur erg leuk om zo iemand te treffen voor een lezing terwijl ik het eigenlijk juist van me wilde afzetten
7053143 nou ik ben niet gaan wandelen omdat ik dacht dat het om de een of andere reden zinvol zou zijn voor het studium generale en toch was het zinvol
7053144 ja want ik genoot van het avontuur en het leverde een mooie ontmoeting en een lezing op ik had er gewoon zin in en heb gedaan wat in me opkwam zonder erover te oordelen
7053145 zinvolheid ligt niet in het oordeel maar in de ervaring
7053146 mooi zo beste huub een bewonderenswaardige en overtuigende bewering dus volgens jou is oordelen niet zinvol maar zinloos
7053147 laten we dan nu eens onderzoeken of deze boreling levensvatbaar is
7053148 en het element van verrassing dan de verrijking die kan ontstaan door de inbreng van een ander die anders is
7053149 het werd een bijzonder ontspannen ontmoeting compleet voorzien van het brabants kwartiertje bovendien spraken we een dialect dat we beiden kenden filosofie we belandden bij een vijver die verscholen lag van het pad er groeide de lekkerste bramen en het was er heerlijk stil erik zijn actief luisterende doch rustige houding was aangenaam we hadden wel het een en ander gemeenschappelijk en er ligt wellicht een goede basis tot een samenwerking in eindhoven heerlijk om daarvoor de tijd te nemen we bespraken filosofie literatuur mensen visies wandelingen en boekwinkeltjes in belgische kloosters en ondertussen aten we de bramen die hij plukte
7053150 dan valt onze aanleg wat ontwikkeling en het ontbreken daarvan betreft te vergelijken met een situatie als deze
7053151 stel je mensen voor die verblijven in een soort onderaardse grotachtige ruimte van jongs af aan zitten ze daar met boeien rond hun benen en hun nek zo kunnen ze niet weg en kunnen ze alleen recht voor zich uitkijken want die boeien maken het hun onmogelijk het hoofd te draaien
7053152 want geloof jij om te beginnen dat zulke lui van zichzelf n van elkaar ooit wat anders te zien hebben gekregen dan de schaduwen die door het vuur op de rotswand tegenover hen worden geworpen
7053153 hoe zou dat kunnen als ze hun leven lang hun hoofd niet kunnen bewegen
7053154 hoe het met de bevrijding van hun boeien en de genezing van hun onwetendheid zou verlopen als iemand uit hun midden werd losgemaakt en hij ineens op moest staan zijn nek draaien rondlopen en naar het licht opkijken
7053155 hoe zou hij reageren als iemand hem vertelde dat alles wat hij vroeger had gezien onzin was
7053156 als ik mijn waarheid heb en jij die van jou hoe kunnen we elkaar dan ooit ontmoeten
7053157 het eerste probleem waarvoor we ons geplaatst zien is vooringenomenheid het complex van vooroordelen waarmee we sedert onze kinderjaren zijn opgezadeld hoe kunnen we ons daarvan bevrijden we kunnen niet als bij toverslag al onze overtuigingen en meningen overboord zetten met de meeste van die vooroordelen zijn we in de alledaagse ervaring zo vertrouwd geraakt dat we eraan gehecht en als het ware mee vergroeid zijn maar misschien is er toch een mogelijkheid om ons aan de ban van die vooroordelen te onttrekken we kunnen ze dan wel niet meteen overboord zetten maar we kunnen toch tenminste proberen ze te neutraliseren of onschadelijk te maken door ze van hun overtuigingskracht te ontdoen hoe door met alle macht te proberen ze in twijfel te trekken
7053158 er is waarheid alle waarheden zijn eindig elke waarheid heeft aanvullende waarheden naast zich onder zich en boven zich de waarheid is onuitputtelijk
7053159 light skinned black people have always been considerably overrepresented and dark skinned blacks dramatically underrepresented as elected officials
7053160 believed that hosting such a discussion of the issues was an excellent way to illustrate democracy to the rest of the world and to show that neighbors can disagree politically and still work together toward the good of their community
7053161 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7053162 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7053163 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7053164 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7053165 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7053166 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7053167 im done i dont want to i dont want to do this anymore
7053168 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7053169 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7053170 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7053171 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7053172 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7053173 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7053174 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7053175 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7053176 a visa will be granted to enable a 17 day visit from october 21
7053177 snoop dogg trades in toxic messages of menace violence misogyny and lawlessness
7053178 to add to the fire hes actually had issues with firearms and drugs
7053179 whats wrong with these social engineers to let such a person into the country
7053180 there is enough violence in the community without importing violent rappers from america
7053181 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7053182 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7053183 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7053184 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7053185 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7053186 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7053187 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7053188 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7053189 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7053190 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7053191 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7053192 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7053193 we were still very low very close to the ground

7053198 i played well but its hard to break the chinese wall they are good players also there are not so many easy points
7053199 they have proved since athens now that they are in the best shape when its important we have to fight to beat them and i hope that this can encourage more players if i can do it then young players can also do it
7053200 a lot of us certainly are suffering from fay fatigue but weve got to stay focused
7053201 el gobierno no hace nada y cada vez se siembra menos ma z y m s soja
7053202 we asked if he were willing to come to a setup like ours he was which pleased us but the differences are insurmountable
7053203 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights
7053204 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7053205 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7053206 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7053207 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7053208 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel

7053227 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
7053228 at times of extraordinary volatility and dramatic risk re pricing maintaining price stability could be the best contribution that monetary policy could give to the return to financial stability
7053229 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future
7053230 the emphasis still is on the economic and market risks but still trying to walk a fine line on inflation as well
7053231 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
7053232 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
7053233 add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7053234 we will continue to review all of our liquidity facilities to determine if they are having their intended effects or require modification

7053296 with the bush legacy of reckless war and economic mismanagement 2008 is a year that favors the generic democratic candidate over the generic republican one yet barack obama with every natural and structural advantage in the presidential race is running only neck and neck against john mccain obama has built a crack political operation raised record sums and inspired millions with his eloquence and vision mccain has struggled with a fractious campaign team lacks clarity and discipline and remains a stranger to charisma
7053297 we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives the rest of the world would embrace a less fearful and more open post post 9 11 america
7053298 mccain represents a cold war style of nationalism that doesnt get the shift from geopolitics to geoeconomics the centrality of soft power in a multipolar world or the transformative nature of digital technology at this hinge moment in human history mccains approach to our gravest problems is hawkish denial he wants to deal with the global energy crisis by drilling and our debt crisis by cutting taxes and he responds to security challenges from georgia to iran with bush like belligerence and pique

7053392 oh yes my singing because i have a good voice sorry
7053393 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home

7053395 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
7053396 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
7053397 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7053398 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7053399 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7053400 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7053401 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7053402 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7053403 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7053404 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7053405 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7053406 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7053407 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7053408 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7053409 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7053410 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7053411 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7053412 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7053413 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7053414 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7053415 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7053416 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7053417 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7053418 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7053419 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7053420 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7053421 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7053422 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7053423 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7053424 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7053425 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7053426 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7053427 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7053428 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7053436 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

7053439 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7053440 this is a planning took where all things are going
7053441 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7053442 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7053443 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7053444 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7053445 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7053446 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7053447 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7053448 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7053449 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7053450 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7053451 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7053452 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7053453 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7053454 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7053455 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7053456 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7053457 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7053458 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7053459 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7053460 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7053461 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7053462 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7053463 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7053464 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7053465 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7053466 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7053467 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7053468 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7053469 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7053470 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7053471 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7053472 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7053473 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7053474 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7053475 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

7053495 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7053496 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7053497 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7053498 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7053499 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7053500 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7053501 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7053502 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7053503 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7053504 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7053505 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7053506 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7053507 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7053508 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7053509 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7053517 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7053518 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7053519 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who

7053550 what is with the support so and so x group
7053551 well im not sure but the rumor as heard from p is that she had some sort of run in with the law maybe over drugs or alcohol
7053552 the most difficult thing is i dont understand what happened
7053553 i cant explain why my breathing went off the way it did because that has never happened to me before
7053554 this is a unique climate i guess but i have no idea i just cant explain it
7053555 it was an awesome race it was amazing out there
7053556 unfortunately i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7053557 but you know to come to your first olympics and get fourth thats pretty awesome
7053558 it gives me confidence that i can be top three in the world
7053559 to come in and do it at the olympics when everyone is trying to be top three is pretty spectacular im sure im going to go home and im going to have a little moment of oh my god i lost fourth
7053560 but i kind of made the decision that whatever happened i wasnt going to feel like i lost third i won fourth its an awesome result and ive got lots of time ahead of me to try and come back do it again
7053561 when i had to stop to catch my breath i was certainly asking myself questions
7053562 but remember this was a bicycle race not the end of the world
7053563 its not the worst test of my life people might like me to say that its the biggest disappointment of my life its a disappointment for sure but you cant control everything its one day in a life and it happened to me today
7053564 even when i have fallen or broken something on her bike i finished the races
7053565 this was a physical problem this is my health so i couldnt do anything else
7053566 i feel there is something but i will check it when i get home
7053567 i got a new wheel and i flatted that at that point i was way too far back and was lapped
7053568 if there isnt common ground then he has a decision to make about whether or not to visit the governor general
7053569 if parliament comes back there will be a confidence motion at the first available opportunity according to the bloc
7053570 well have one last good faith attempt in terms of a private meeting between the prime minister and opposition leaders
7053571 is trying to save face trying to find an excuse to once again break his word this time on the fixed election date law
7053572 the official excuse that parliament is not functioning is phony
7053573 what is true is that the prime minister does not want people to realize he has ethical problems in his government and to what extent he has badly prepared us as a country for the economic slowdown we face
7053574 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
7053575 this is the sort of thing that they usually trot out at election time
7053576 importantly from a neuroscience perspective while the bee brain is only about the size of a sesame seed it has many of the characteristics of the human brain including complex behaviors such as advanced memory and learning
7053577 the ability to comprehensively sequence any persons genome is the type of quantum leap needed to usher in an age of personalized medicine where healthcare providers can use an individuals genetic code to prevent diagnose and treat diseases
7053578 a new generation of sequencing technologies is stepping in front of the already impressive technologies that enabled initial sequencing of the human genome
7053579 we continue to seek further innovation to enable routine sequencing of genomes to advance scientific knowledge and healthcare
7053580 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
7053581 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
7053582 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
7053583 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
7053584 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
7053585 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
7053586 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
7053587 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
7053588 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
7053589 may point to an association between infertility diminished semen quality and periodontal infections
7053590 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
7053591 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
7053592 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
7053593 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
7053594 right now theres not much you can do about the vector so it is all a matter of management
7053595 the wheat curl mite is found on volunteer wheat and many different grasses and is blown in the air by winds
7053596 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
7053597 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
7053598 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
7053599 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
7053600 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs

7053607 soy corredora y a veces las cosas malas no son malas y quise hacer algo que desde ni a ya tra a la inclinaci n pero no le hab a puesto mucha atenci n ni la importancia que tiene y pues a partir de mi lesi n empec a pintar como una forma de expresarme y ahora aqu en la casa del artista como que te haces un compromiso con los dem s

7053609 en mi experiencia me he dado cuenta que es muy importante que los ni os te vayan guiando que vayan sugiriendo sus tem ticas y no impon rselos ellos solos van a ir pidiendo cu l es el camino por el que se quieren ir eso es importante en estos talleres en donde la atenci n es personalizada en donde no todos est n viendo lo mismo se les sugiere para que aprendan pero una vez aprendiendo ellos deciden
7053610 primero nos enfocamos mucho en lo que es el dibujo y vamos combin ndolo con diferentes t cnicas en este ciclo lo que me importa mucho es darle un giro para los ni os que ya llevan a os en el taller

7053630 i think the most import thing we can do is to make the choice this november clear to the voters i think we are at a historic crossroads the economy is not working for ordinary americans its not just the steady accumulation of bad news higher unemployment higher inflation i think people recognize partly because of high gas prices that weve got structural problems that have to be attended to peoples incomes and wages are flat and their costs are rising the social compact that delivered health care and pensions through jobs are going away and so people are i think are worried that if we dont deal with these issues now that our standard of living could if not decline at least remain stagnant so what we want to do with this convention is be very clear john mccains policies do not dramatically differ from george bushs and so we should not expect a different outcome if on the other hand were willing to push for real change and the promise of a clean energy economy a health care system that works for all americans college thats more affordable investments in science and technology and infrastructure all those things can lay the groundwork for a more unified and more prosperous and more balanced economy down the road so thats the most important goal we have set now obviously we want to also make sure that the american people have a clear sense of who i am coming out of the convention not because this election is about me but rather because i dont want the republican strategy of attacking my character or misrepresenting my biography to get in the way of peoples ability to make a clear decision about the issues
7053631 rain i cant do much about weve got to trust the meteorologists that say rain is very unlikely in denver that time of year you know in terms of the speech you know in some ways four years ago was special because i didnt know any better i just sat in a hotel room watching a basketball game and wrote it up most of it sort of in one sitting and it went through a bunch of revisions but basically the framework of the structure was there this speech requires more thought more preparation and you know im collaborating with my speechwriters more in making some of the key arguments that i think have to be made
7053632 four years ago was special because it was a surprise to people i was new on the national scene and so i think some of the language that i used then was new people have now heard me speak for the last four years and very intensely for the last two and so you know in some ways theyve seen it and heard it before so im not focused on trying to match the soaring rhetoric or levels of excitement that we had four years ago this is much more a yeoman like task of making the case for my presidency and the need to moe american a fundamentally different direction
7053633 were going to just keep on hammering away at what my plan is and how it contracts with what we have seen over the last eight years and what john mccain proposes but john youve been on the campaign trail with me this week you were at two town hall meetings today i think youd be hard pressed to suggest that
7053634 and so the question you know not to push the point but if the people in my town hall meetings are getting a very clear sense of what i stand for and the folks in the public at large arent and theyre getting most of their information from you guys you know it raises a real question i suspect that this week you know the press has devoted 90 percent of its time to vp speculation despite having no information on it so you know were always wrestling with that challenge and well try to use our tv spots to communicate these issues but we only have 60 seconds i do think that to some degree the debates will be very important on this front because my suspicion is that viewer ship is going to be very high and will give us unmediated ability to talk to the american people about what we plan to do
7053635 im not somebody as you know who spends a lot of time obsessing with polling i mean if i did about this time last year i would have dropped out of the race we always anticipated this race was going to be relatively tight its not as if coming out of the primary season we had some huge lead and we had a bruising primary battle john mccain had three four months where basically his views were unchallenged so i dont think its surprising that the race has tightened i think that although the american people know we need change john mccains been in pubic life for 25 years hes got a compelling biography im relatively new and people are going to take their time and lift the hood and kick the tires before they make their final decision on this race
7053636 leading into the convention it was always our belief that its important to amplify what the differences are between the two campaigns and the two candidates partly because thats one of the ways that we can get the press to write about the issues and let people know you know what i plan to do as president
7053637 well look you know i would suggest that enduring torture is a fairly unique experience that no president or very few presidents have undergone what i would point to is the journey ive traveled throughout my entire life you know its pretty unlikely that i ended up here i wasnt born into prominence was raised by a single mom i had to scratch and claw my way to the point i am now and i think ive done so without cutting corners or compromising my integrity and maybe it looks easier than it is
7053638 well you know i think the choices ive made in my adult life to work as a community organizer instead of taking more lucrative offers to work as a civil rights attorney rather than go to a white shoe law firm all those decisions have been consistent with my belief that a life of service is a way of expressing ones patriotism you know i think military service is one of those paths to service and one that i have the highest regard for
7053639 i feel like we have done a pretty good job this summer if you got the transcripts of all the speeches weve made on everything from afghanistan to energy to fixing the economy thats a pretty substantive body of work we have not devoted a lot of time to silliness i have pointed out policy contrasts with john mccain but i havent spent time attacking his character over the last month weve had to respond to a series of attacks that are fairly typical of what republicans have done during the presidential races over the last 20 years so it is a challenge to make sure that you respond forcefully without getting distracted and part of my goal is to make sure that were not spending time talking about me but that were talking about the american people the fact that theyre losing their homes losing their jobs losing their pensions you know if i can consistently push the argument in that direction then i think we will have done the american people a valuable service
7053640 i think first and foremost the leader of america and promoting americas national interests thats the job description keeping americans safe and secure growing the american economy but i think now more than ever the fate of americas economy our long term security also depends on our ability to forge alliances and partnerships with other countries and certainly the lines between foreign policy and economic policy blurred when trade and technology have shrunk the globe and made goods and services move across boarders with lightening speed issues like terrorism are transnational so my job as president would be to look after the american people and their safety and security but part of that job involves being able to see beyond our own horizon
7053641 i actually think this has been a very humbling experience you know the longer im at this the more i realize how many problems have mounted over the last eight years how many tough decisions were going to have to make to dig ourselves out of the hole that were in you know ive also learned how solid the american people how generous they are and how decent they are you know they really need help right they need leadership right now and so i think its very humbling to be in the position im in knowing that you know im one man and you know will make the occasional mistake what keeps me up at night is not losing the election but its you know making sure that i can deliver on the promises that are being made in the course of this campaign and you know the broader promise of america that people still believe in
7053642 im not sure that gimmicks are whats required i think just hard work were going to hit the ground and campaign a lot of places and talk to people and listen to them and explain to them the choice they face in november and if we do that i think well win
7053643 yes theres no doubt over the course of 19 months youre going to have your good weeks and youre going to have your bad weeks and youre going to have speeches where youre hitting on all cylinders and others that are you know painful to listen to or to deliver but overall i think we get better you know for me the challenge is not so much technical you know how am i delivering a speech or you know is our campaign well run it has much more to do with something in your gut do you feel like you are tapped into the truth of what people are experiencing right now are you communicating a sense of why this election is so important are you able to transmit the struggles that youre hearing from the single mom or a guy whose been laid off are you able to give voice to that in a way that resonates you know youre not always there but i think what you try to do is its like hitting in baseball you know youre never going bat 1 000 but what you want is to have a good swing and make contact and hopefully your batting average improves over time
7053644 we had some wonderful candidates people who are serious and who i respect deeply it has been a difficult decision making process but im confident that from the pool that i had to choose from well have a very strong vice president who can be a good partner for me not only in campaigning but also in governing
7053645 we have plenty of work to do but you know i tend to work pretty well under pressure

7053675 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
7053676 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
7053677 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
7053678 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements

7053697 bullet injured aziz was brought to the hospital with protruding intestines on aug 11
7053698 he aziz was brought dead we couldnt conduct any post mortem because the body was soon taken by an angry mob for funeral
7053699 pierced through azizs body and even forensic experts cannot say what kind of bullet hit him
7053700 the bullet had entered the left side of his back and left from the right side
7053701 we have just lodged firs first information reports and detailed investigations would be launched soon
7053702 pakistan backed separatists have been using the tool of political killing to stoke anti india passions in the valley but i am not sure if azizs death falls in that category
7053703 nobody is going to believe this narayanans theory he was killed in police and paramilitary firing and i am an eyewitness to that
7053704 aziz fell to the forces bullets in front of senior administrative and police officials
7053705 district commissioner baseer khan and district police chief b sreenivas were there and even they know who killed aziz
7053706 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7053707 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7053708 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us
7053709 i had in mind parallel efforts with that of owwa from our part at the provincial government to be undertaken among other functions by the provincial council for lofws welfare in the same way that the nbi and the pnp have parallel efforts to combat crime well have a provincial council doing its mandated tasks which may effectively complement efforts of the owwa and other national agencies
7053710 considering the importance of the said ordinance to the welfare of lofws and their dependents we are glad that this has finally been approved with finality
7053711 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7053712 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7053713 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7053714 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7053715 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7053716 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7053717 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7053718 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7053719 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7053720 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7053721 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7053722 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7053723 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write

7053725 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
7053726 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
7053727 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
7053728 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
7053729 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
7053730 afghan president hamid karzai strongly condemns the uncoordinated air strike by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province which resulted in the death of at least 70 people including women and children
7053731 we will continue our demonstration till the international community listens to us and bring those who carried out yesterdays attack to justice

7053734 42 awesome business card designs with links to 100s more
7053735 a card with some assembly required forces the recipient to spend more time with it which is a good thing if you want to avoid getting lost in the shuffle
7053736 i think talent shows play an incredibly important part of what we do
7053737 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7053738 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7053739 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7053740 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7053741 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7053742 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do
7053743 you have to remember they even controlled the weather no other country would do this
7053744 the olympic games are all about sport it is about the olympic spirit it is not a political platform
7053745 that dirty red commie did his homework and deduced that the mst ing was limited to ktvh beartooth nbc covering the greater great falls havre helena lewistown area that means at least six people saw the phenomena including commie
7053746 at this moment i can say that our talks with the governor appointed panel have been absolutely fruitful and productive
7053747 this also depends on our and their viewpoints we are hopeful of the talks progressing towards that end
7053748 attestations on the part of us officials which allude to india having to accept a new draft hinting at conditionalities cannot be considered acceptable
7053749 clearly reserves the right to walk out if extraneous conditions are imposed if so the failure would not be on the part of india
7053750 the objections rooted in the selective application of so called non proliferation concerns may at best be relevant to non weapons countries without over half a century of indigenous r and d and a technologically advanced programme
7053751 if indeed such concerns were serious an objective assessment of the rampant proliferation over the last decade is called for where many of these very countries have remained mute witnesses to well known instances of illegal activity and violations of international undertakings
7053752 if we give back 400 acres of land to farmers in singur the nano project will have to be scrapped
7053753 it will take parliament 10 minutes to pass a resolution for reinstatement of deposed judges after which an executive order should be issued by the prime minister in the evening
7053754 we have asked ppp to inform us by saturday night whether the judges will be reinstated by monday
7053755 we do not want a player to become a selector as soon he retires we dont want them to be biased as they are the contemporaries of players who might still be in the team
7053756 this is just a proposal which needs to be discussed again and ratified at the agm
7053757 as far as the merit of the judgement is concerned we are not bothered our stand is with regard to the powers encroached by the delhi high court in directing the two senior advocates not to appear in the high court and its subordinate courts for the next four months
7053758 if it is not set aside then the order will become a law
7053759 the bar council of india is not in favour of strike according to the supreme court the strike is applicable only in exceptional cases
7053760 even the bci will take strict action if they will be found guilty but encroachment of power of the council is not acceptable
7053761 it was only through media that we came to know about it
7053762 the power of the bci are original powers appellate powers and revision powers if the disciplinary proceedings were not finally concluded within one year by the state bar council then the matter will be transferred to the bci

7053901 i couldnt have stood out more if i was riding a brontosaurus through there

7053916 you remind me of my friend deanna shes a female bodybuilder
7053917 i was taking down the donkey from the nativity scene in our kitchen and i thought to myself if i drop the donkey on the floor and it breaks then i can tell people that i broke my ass on the kitchen floor
7053918 you see the difference between me and you is my mouth gets me into trouble and yours gets you out of it
7053919 the geisha sleep in certain positions so as not to disturb their elaborate hairdos and thats what i was just doing
7053920 i dont want to be tied down and have my time consumed by someone there to say i love you to and having to hold hands and shop together and eat with and no one to hold and cuddle with i can play xbox all night long baby
7053921 finally i got up and read my bible i figured that would put me to sleep

7053928 i promise i really did check him out before i started dating him
7053929 so i was typing to you and there was dead silence on the phone and forgot i was on the phone with my mom and she randomly started talking and it startled me
7053930 whos the one whose name begins with a j and ends with an n
7053931 go shopping with him and youll never be satisfied with another mans shopping again
7053932 do you guys have a money changer in the temple

7053938 im a samaritan shun me just meet me at the well at 3 oclock
7053939 this is the first time shes been publicly traded on the girl exchange and her stock has gone sky high
7053940 this isnt fair prybys only got on your wall of quotes because pretty much anything that proceeds from her mouth is notably retarded
7053941 youre just upset because you cant put that on facebook
7053942 theres a stomach virus going around and every girl on my hall has been inflicted with the terror
7053943 youre like a reality t v show i want to turn the channel and walk away but for some strange reason i cant
7053944 i own too many nice ties not to go to the spring banquet
7053945 god blessed me with great hair im counting on that to bring me true love
7053946 this song was written for my future wife which is none of you
7053947 i hope i dont get married til im in grad school so i can pick up undergrad chicks too
7053948 i have a new vein on my leg i feel like an old woman one of those blue nasty ones
7053949 may it not be said of me methinks she doth protest too much because really im just raising a voice for all of us you choose to mercilessly poke numerous times throughout the day
7053950 cause all my good looking genes cant override someone whos ugly
7053951 i lost it from all the throwing up i did
7053952 you know if you keep breathing like that when i talk to you about girls youre never going to get married
7053953 i dont sleep with him any more john hes older than me hes older than you
7053954 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
7053955 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
7053956 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer
7053957 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
7053958 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
7053959 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
7053960 this is a bit better than i have been playing and i have to take it on from here
7053961 i have said all along i feel i have a lot to offer
7053962 with all the ankle operations and all the questions over me if i didnt think i could play this type of cricket i wouldnt have gone through it all again
7053963 it will only be through performances that ultimately i will be judged
7053964 i have not scored 50 for a while so it was nice to stick my bat up i didnt know what to do
7053965 kevin realises i have worked hard on my batting and i think he was just as pleased as i was
7053966 he wants me to play my natural game and the way in which he has seen me bat and knows i can do
7053967 you can play with no fear you can play with freedom but you cant be reckless there is a balance for us all to find and hopefully the recklessness is behind me
7053968 i played to my strengths and was quite calculated in the way i played now i have to keep doing that
7053969 i got a few out of the middle early on and gave myself a chance by looking at a few i have got a sound technique i feel and a method which has worked in the past
7053970 it is just building on that i have been working with phil on my balance making sure my head is not going over i have two eyes on the ball and i am playing it late
7053971 it was when kevin and i had been at the crease for a while when i decided to take it on a little bit more
7053972 it helped batting with him hes obviously a fine player and he can make things look easy at times
7053973 very single minded determined and that has rubbed off on the rest of the team
7053974 he is very up front with his views and the way he plays his cricket and as a team we are doing that well
7053975 for me as well i am back to a role which i feel comfortable in
7053976 i always enjoy playing with the big lad he is a class act
7053977 when he played at the oval his first over back gave the side a lift
7053978 when you have someone bowling that quick with that much bounce and you are into the opposition everyone gets a lift from it
7053979 it is nice to see him playing one day cricket again and smiling
7053980 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore ha detto alladnkronos padre rungi stiamo parlando di persone molto preparate che operano nel sociale dove oltre alla bellezza spirituale ma per avere visibilita ce anche bisogno di una bella presenza
7053981 lidea mi e venuta parlando con alcune sorelle con le quali stavo pregando sulla spiaggia di mondragone ha spiegato il prete casertano eravamo in preghiera con turisti e villeggianti a dimostrazione di quanto sia aperta la mentalita di queste suore
7053982 si tratta di uniniziativa che sfrutta le potenzialita del web ha sottolineato padre rungi infatti verra gestita interamente su internet
7053983 gli stessi utenti del web il contatto non sara diretto ma online
7053984 e importante ha aggiunto don rungi sfruttare tutte le potenzialita del web infatti lassociazionismo cattolico e molto attivo in questo campo daltronde e ormai il modo migliore per poter mediare con i giovani
7053985 it should be called lets see what old guy can avoid losing every game
7053986 i think it should i think i should have a shot at him i dont see why i wouldnt who else sells as much but ill fight whoever
7053987 i think it seems to make sense for the ufc but thats not something i concern myself with right now ive got to get past rashad before any of that makes any sense
7053988 im done i dont want to i dont want to do this anymore
7053989 ho intenzione di fare qualcosa di male per la strada
7053990 ha detto questa mania della grandi auto in america non molto utile per nella lista sono inclusi anche
7053991 vaan gaal is a professor and today we have learnt
7053992 now lets think about the game the times picayune nola com nbsp la nbsp
7053993 i havent jumped the world record so that is something i would like to do in the future and im aiming for
7053994 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7053995 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7053996 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7053997 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7053998 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7053999 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7054000 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7054001 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7054002 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7054003 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7054004 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7054005 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7054006 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7054007 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7054008 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7054009 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy
7054010 the position of president will not be replaced rather a restructuring of the current staff has occurred such that each of the department heads will assume additional responsibilities to maintain the operational synergy of the office environment i have been and continue to be extremely confident in the staff that is in place simply put this transition will be smooth and seamless and i look forward to the upcoming season under this new structure
7054011 it makes it easier for us to prepare for the games as we will become relatively familiar with the conditions as well so we are happy with that idea
7054012 si se me raja la cabeza por tirarme al p blico voy a estar feliz me gusta brincar y hacer cosas que quiz s a otros les d miedo cuando el p blico va a ver mi show tiene que salir alegre
7054013 como todas las noticias que se escuchan ltimamente son negativas yo quer a hacer un tema refrescante

7054016 yo soy la cabeza pero es un trabajo de equipo
7054017 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7054018 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7054019 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7054020 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7054021 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7054022 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7054023 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7054024 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7054025 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7054026 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7054027 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7054028 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7054029 democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion specific values
7054030 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square
7054031 were being told to sit in the back of the bus
7054032 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7054033 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7054034 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7054037 ik voelde me op mijn gemak toen voelde ik me gelukkig en eenzaam te gelijk ze zei
7054038 mama heeft het moeilijk nu en het is beter als jullie ergens anders blijven voor tijdelijk
7054039 een eerste minpunt is de slechte conditie van de belgische bevolking in het algemeen
7054040 met alle verschillende niveaus zitten we met drie keer te veel beleidsmakers op financieel vlak is het budget voor sport in belgi ook ruimschoots onvoldoende
7054041 als je niet een klein beetje hebt moeten lijden en nooit de smaak van een uitzonderlijk resultaat hebt geproefd lukt het niet in de topsport
7054042 i came out here ready i came out here prepared i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7054043 are you going to be all disappointed when theyre not this big anymore
7054044 and so many catholics that will be a big adjustment for me i think just getting used to many more people and learning how to do ministry to many people than i have before so that will be the biggest challenge for me to personally overcome
7054045 i do this as an act of repentance for a silent church and immobile leaders who have shunned people with hiv and aids as leaders we must engage in public acts of repentance or our words can never be trusted
7054046 looking more globally hiv prevention has enjoyed a lot of focus of this conference
7054047 any institution that has had problems takes a long time to build confidence but were in a much better place than five years ago
7054048 when copca was set up it was important that it was seen as having some distance from the church six years later the work of safeguarding is now integral its not optional or bolted on its about creating an environment where abuse doesnt occur
7054049 there are people who write to the daily mail grumbling there are too many checks ive have more crb checks than i could paper a wall with but thats a minor inconvenience next to the fact that it helps the right people come into the work
7054050 there was a culture right across society of naivety and abuse and an unwillingness to deal with it and the more trusted the person the more damaging the abuse
7054051 people laugh that i had a retirement do when i left scie im now chief executive of st gemmas hospice in leeds which is full time and a member of the west yorkshire police authority
7054052 having been a foster carer for 30 years seeing a variety of children keeps me rooted in why we need good safeguarding i spent most of my working life with homeless people and those with drug and alcohol issues a number of those had seen abuse in their early lives and i suppose thats given me a determination to prevent that happening
7054053 i spent the afternoon a few weeks ago with a group of catholic people with learning disabilities it was a life giving experience seeing them enjoying each others company and being together in the church setting that they shared this was a really positive contribution to their lives

7054056 haile krijgt iedereen aan zijn voeten met zijn glimlach kenenisa met zijn donkere ogen
7054057 maar kenenisa is aan het leren hij volgt engelse les het gaaat al beter
7054058 hij streeft naar eeuwige roem hij wil anders zijn dan haile en daarom heeft hij geprobeerd de dubbel binnen te halen haile kon dat nooit wegens zijn voetproblemen die kon geen dubbelprogramma aan
7054059 met steun van zijn vrouw overigens die hielp geweldig om hem te overtuigen dat hij in peking historie kon schrijven
7054060 zijn leven is nu stabiel hij kan veel meer aan
7054061 hij wil op de spelen in londen deze dubbel nog een keer herhalen hij wil echt de grootste zijn

7054071 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7054072 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7054073 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7054074 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7054075 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7054076 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7054077 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7054078 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7054079 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7054080 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7054081 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7054082 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7054083 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7054084 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7054085 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7054086 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7054087 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7054088 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7054089 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7054090 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7054091 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7054092 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7054093 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7054094 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7054095 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7054096 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7054097 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7054098 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7054099 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7054100 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7054101 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7054102 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7054103 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7054104 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7054105 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7054106 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7054107 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7054108 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7054109 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7054110 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7054111 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7054112 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7054113 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7054114 who are open to doing something on the production side
7054115 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7054116 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7054117 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7054118 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7054119 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7054120 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7054121 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7054122 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7054123 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7054124 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7054125 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7054126 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7054129 weve entered gazan waters were flying the palestinian flag and we now believe that were going to reach the shores of gaza very soon i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks today is a huge victory of people over power
7054130 after reading the book i was so intrigued and inspired i thought to myself this is such an amazing story with such an important message
7054131 ive lost so many close friends in the music business to drugs i felt i had a lot to add to this musical journey
7054132 it never entered our minds it would turn out to be a band situation but everything good that happens in life happens naturally just like this did the magic is so amazing between the three of us this will be one of many albums to come what i love about this is there are no limits no rules were putting our hearts out there and people are responding to it
7054133 it wasnt about being in a band it was all done for the song the story and the message and thats why the final product is

7054139 law inclines in the interest of legitimacy and thumbs down whoreson or fruit of adultery
7054140 where a man and a woman are proved to have lived together as a man and wife the law will presume unless the contrary be clearly proved that they were living together in consequence of a valid marriage and not in a state of concubinage
7054141 the law presumes in favour of marriage and against concubinage when a man and woman have cohabited continuously for a number of years
7054142 petitioner smt payal sharma appeared before us and stated that she is above 21 years of age which is borne out from the high school certificate which shows that her date of birth is 10 7 1980 hence she is a major and has the right to go anywhere and live with anyone in our opinion a man and a woman even without getting married can live together if they wish to this may be regarded as immoral by society but is not illegal there is a difference between law and morality
7054143 if live in relationships are treated on par with marriage many young men and women may not really like to get into such open relationships at the other end ensuring maintenance and giving legal sanction to live in relationships will not make the position of the female partner equal to that of the wife because social acceptance in indian society will take a very long time it still does not have a mindset that accepts the estranged female partner of a live in relationship
7054144 theoretically it may sound like a better proposition than marriage but very few people actually opt for it a live in relationship is not a substitute for marriage
7054145 yeah i went there to see a friend supposed friend it was a man he was supposed to be a friend but then you get there and they try to stick their dick somewhere
7054146 what do you mean of course you think im stupid
7054147 p a man is always going to try to get his dick stuck somewhere
7054148 i know but this stuff is supposedly settled in advance its already been made clear im not interested i travel because the person supposedly wants to spend time with me i went to sacramento tahoe reno up in there the same way one time you know i knew someone and we were talking on the phone im bored i said well why dont you come up here for the weekend
7054149 and i say by god i think i will and then i do but there is never a question i mean i say it right up front i am not sleeping with you you know that right as always i am not interested in any romance and they say they know that
7054150 so then you get up there and they spend the whole time trying to get near you you know they move their chair next to mine try to get closer they try to romance the thing up when there is no romance
7054151 well p i would never do that but you should not be surprised i mean what planet are you on
7054152 what are you saying that youre on planet reality i suppose
7054153 well i am on the planet where you tell a man you arent interested in screwing him and he can comprehend it he can understand those words they are pretty damned simple and its not like i mince them if i didnt state it plainly then i would be playing games but fact is i did state it plainly i dont want to screw you i know that elsa come on up

7054155 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7054156 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7054157 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7054158 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world

7054173 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
7054174 its unfortunate that georgia didnt plan accordingly for growth over the past couple of decades and now is trying to rewrite 200 years of history to address their mistakes
7054175 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth are players that have to be protected
7054176 were not talking about sucking it dry were talking about augmenting some water needs and as you know the tennessee has got plenty of water in it
7054177 the local government delivers food here they are bringing in bread and sausages we are sick of it already but it is enough
7054178 from blue ridge to atlanta from macon to valdosta thousands of unemployed georgians are pouring into our career centers the georgia department of labor is committed to doing everything possible to assist them during these difficult economic times we ask for their patience and cooperation as we work together to overcome these unprecedented challenges
7054179 our goal in this operation is to save lives and to alleviate the suffering of the georgian people we will continue on this mission until the government of georgia and the department of state determines there is no longer a need
7054180 hes not cutting his budget hes just going to the taxpayers and saying you pay for it its just totally irresponsible i cant believe that hes doing it
7054181 as a result of russian aggression against georgia the main highway of georgia m 27 has been kept closed by the occupation forces of the russian federation for several days
7054182 throughout the holiday weekend motorists should expect extreme congestion on the connector southbound delays that easily could extend two or more hours and i expect this back up will stretch far back on i 75 and i 85 as well
7054183 the highway is the backbone of georgias economic infrastructure blocking this route is like smashing the backbone of the country
7054184 now more than ever georgia needs a transportation stimulus package to provide mobility jobs and prosperity in both rural and urban georgia our coalition is committed to working with the governor house senate and all stakeholders to find the right stimulus and funding policies for georgia

7054188 three hundred of us went from camp pendleton to travis afb by train
7054189 some pan am planes had been commandeered to fly us over
7054190 the north koreans were firing at our plane we had to circle around and around for awhile before we could land
7054191 the regulars resented us at first because we had more rank and more experience
7054192 they finally accepted us everybody becomes a brother when things get rough
7054193 because they the marines came to my high school bosse high school and recruited students
7054194 some of my friends joined and at that time it sounded exciting we got a uniform and we got paid for our training it was probably the macho thing at the time
7054195 we were told we would be home by christmas but i didnt believe it
7054196 but we took it lightly however when we saw our first dead korean it shook us
7054197 we were issued these shoepacs which were supposed to keep our feet warm trouble was your feet would sweat
7054198 then when you stopped moving around and sat down ice crystals would form between your toes
7054199 all at once bullets started flying in through the tent the chinese had climbed up the hill where we had just been at
7054200 it was one of the most hellacious nights id ever spent
7054201 the only way out was to fight our way out
7054202 so we tied the wounded and the dead to the hoods of our trucks and started out
7054203 we made a big circle and waited for the chinese they came running through us a lot of hand to hand fighting a lot of mayhem going on
7054204 the chinese were shooting down at us swarming over the hills
7054205 every so often the convoy would stop then the colonel would say boys i hate to tell you this but theyve got us hemmed in again
7054206 then these men no food for two days and all frozen would go trudging off in the deep snow to clear the roadblock they would come back with some wounded load them in the back of the truck with the rest of us and wed continue on our way
7054207 i was on a telephone pole when i saw the chinese coming from then on i was a rifleman
7054208 we could not fire our weapons then the chinese would know how many of us were there we could see the chinese coming down they would come down two or three at a time they could see us but they didnt know how many of us were lying there in the morning we were relieved by another company and we went on to the next hill
7054209 the noises the chinese made before they attacked the bells whistles and bugles still raises the hair on the back of my neck when i think about it
7054210 of course once the firing started you couldnt hear anything else
7054211 my most frightening time was the breaking of the trap to allow the 1st marine division to exit the chosin reservoir area
7054212 we suffered many casualties and i not only feared for my well being but that of all those around me the horrible conditions may have worked in our favor in that we didnt have time to be afraid because we were battling the elements all the time
7054213 my most vivid memories concern the cold and how miserable we were this is fairly common with chosin survivors remembering the bodies and body parts of young men littering the road as we advanced still haunts me
7054214 thousands of refugees streaming down the msr with no place to get out of the cold
7054215 the kids were crying all the time they were involved too they were scared and would come to us theres so much of that in war people dont always realize that
7054216 the korean people are such good people i felt deeply sorry for them and what little some people had they suffered so much from that war its one thing that you never forget i did as much as i could it really hurt me to see how brutal the war was to the korean people
7054217 absolutely it was worth it we did not win in korea but we didnt allow communism to take over either
7054218 the korean war was the first challenge to the spread of communism
7054219 i was able to do what i did but knowing now the way things are today i would not do it again this generation would not do what we had done
7054220 there was no time to dwell on it when i got home most men went about their jobs i returned to college for my senior year graduated in june 1952 and began my career as an elementary teacher
7054221 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government
7054222 i did not like the tube in my mouth now go ahead and accept the rope in my neck

7054235 this is another example of how our government through the chemicals management plan is taking real action to reduce the presence of harmful chemicals in our environment and protecting it for future generations

7054254 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy
7054255 the first run was ok the track was improving and the grip level was getting better with every lap
7054256 on the second run i had a good lap except for a small mistake in turn 14 where i lost two to three tenths but it was still not bad then on the last run i had some problems with the traffic on my out lap and couldnt warm up the tyres so they werent ready for the first couple of corners so i locked up in the first corner thats why i couldnt improve my lap time which was for sure disappointing as the final run is always the quickest and i couldnt improve my time so last on the grid lets see for tomorrow
7054257 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7054258 i think a good effort from the team and giancarlo got the maximum out of the car in qualifying its the first race with our quick shift box and i think we have clearly taken a step forward in competitiveness and its nice to start out qualifying some of the works cars in the progress i am very proud of the team now we are just 1 3secs from the fastest time of the day and really pushing to move into the midfield for tomorrows race we know there will be a lot of incidents and potentially a lot of safety cars but we know our race pace is normally better than our qualifying pace so i think we can genuinely race with the midfield and look for a potential opportunity to score
7054259 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7054260 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7054261 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7054262 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7054263 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7054264 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7054265 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
7054266 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7054267 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7054268 went to law school on a full academic scholarship the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship
7054269 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
7054270 but ive never gone around telling people things that arent true about me
7054271 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7054272 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7054273 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
7054274 ive never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of gatorade
7054275 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything

7054278 together these four factors account for about two thirds of the large differences among states
7054279 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7054280 en zullen we die dag gaan merken of het allemaal zijn doel zal bereiken
7054281 this is a place of genocide our ancestors were force marched here in 1862 and interned in the concentration camp for an entire winter so many of our people died here women and children so much of our history is ignored and suppressed we are here to tell the truth about this history and challenge the sesquicentennial celebration
7054282 two skittish horses were steered by their mounted officers through the protestors endangering everyone in their path including several small children
7054283 unsure of what to do one officer radioed for backup as reinforcements arrived one officer said i thought we came down to do some thumping a sheriffs suv tried to force its way through the crowd of protestors to clear a path for the wagon train then two kids and two women laid down in front of the suv for twenty minutes while protestors smudged prayer drums sounded and speakers addressed their message about the pasts atrocities officers conferred debating how best to remove the blockade dakota protestors cried the history of the atrocities committed including land theft ethnic cleansing bounties placed on dakota scalps up to 200 dollars the largest mass hanging in us history the horrors of the concentration camp at fort snelling and the brutalities of the war of 1862
7054284 you are benefiting from the same colonial practices which justified the genocide of the dakota people waziyatawin stated as she was pressed against the hood of a patrol car before being led away this wagon train is a fantasy of manifest destiny as some sort of righteous thing next to go were her two minor children talon and autumn cavender wilson anita rae chris mato nunpa jim anderson and diane elliot followed before the officers ceased making arrests
7054285 the introduction of new media is never critically revolutionary new media are less points of epistemic rupture than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of meaning as such
7054286 sound reproduction became defined by and against an existing field of metaphors attitudes assumptions and practices varied constructions of mimesis and music formed important contexts for the uses and users of the new medium
7054287 amid an existing textual economy a world and workplace powerfully self constructed according to the logic of contemporary media print publication broadcasting hollywood and the record labels but also punch cards printouts and paperwork experiences with digital networks have helped to construct a coincident yet contravening logic for digital texts partly in response to material features of the new medium and partly in response to the hugely varied contexts of their ongoing reception and development

7054289 are there any techniques for the purification and reorientation of an energy which is naturally selfish in such a way that when moments of choice arrive we shall be sure of acting rightly

7054291 we are determined to make sure that only properly licensed drivers operate in bournemouth
7054292 hes taken some steps forward and on occasion he has taken a step back but he took a big step forward tonight
7054293 we had some timely hitting and just glad we came out with the win
7054294 we had talks on many issues and also on the land issue the talks were cordial and most probably we will be able to arrive at some decision in one or two days
7054295 we have discussed and exchanged views in a cordial manner and we have decided to meet again
7054296 till now we have made a loss of about 5000 crore rupees today every businessman wants to cut down the losses and would like our brothers in the amarnath shrine board to sit with the government authorities to find a solution to it
7054297 we have asked them tata motors that if you are facing problems over there in singur we are ready to give you red carpet welcome moreover we have right to say this as they are from this place we have told them earlier as well to come here to set up their plant
7054298 we will see if they approach us as you have seen our state government always welcomes industry which will bring revenues to our state and jobs for our young people we always welcome industry and good investment in our state
7054299 today is the eighth day of indefinite fast for tibet without food and water and the third batch has entered the eighth day four of the hunger strikers health has become very critical the doctors at ram manohar lohia hospital have advised that the hunger strikers need immediate admission otherwise there is a risk to their life so the police have forcibly without our knowledge taken all the hunger strikers except one

7054305 intelligence and out of the box thinking of the technicians of the unit has earned us praise from all quarters
7054306 the sdi software has made the su30mki platform more versatile and compatible with other air forces
7054307 our athletes have to walk long distances from a very young age to go to school unlike those in developed countries so they just get used to it quite early
7054308 we are very good at long distance because of the hardships we face training at high altitudes has also helped
7054309 conditions are hard in ethiopia and our athletes are used to that and having to work hard
7054310 we focus on what we can do and we have a project of starting them from 800 meters and then go to long distance the events we have got most medals for in the past
7054311 most of it is just better planning kenyans and ethiopians work very hard at developing their talent and raising the level of their performance
7054312 we had expected to perform better so this calls for sober reflection on our part
7054313 taking sideswipes at the russians by excluding them from the g8 and so on is highly demonstrative but its not necessarily going to change russian behavior
7054314 the bottom line is theres not a huge number of levers that we can use
7054315 now if you were to ask me will any of that work my answer is no i dont think itll have much effect on the russians other than to deepen their very angry mood at the moment
7054316 for some time now russians have been wondering if our opinion counts for nothing in those institutions do we really need them just to sit at the nicely set dinner table and listen to lectures
7054317 russia has a very good dialogue contacts with authorities in iran that has been very helpful throughout
7054318 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia
7054319 they are paying a price in terms of their reputation internationally the readiness of companies to invest in russia the state of the russian stock market and therell be some russians who are mindful of that
7054320 a lot of us certainly are suffering from fay fatigue but weve got to stay focused
7054321 this record takes all the different styles weve created in the past and glues them together into one cohesive sound
7054322 there are elements of what weve done before on this record but were more concerned with moving forward than looking back bella morte fans old and new are gonna love this one
7054323 its less schizophrenic than our other releases weve created something completely new here by combining elements of what weve done in the past
7054324 we would like our publicist rey to make us very very wealthy then we will take him out for a nice dinner maybe two nice dinners

7054332 he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7054333 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7054334 it was very tough for me to get here but it has all been worth it
7054335 finally everything has turned out fine even after all the problems people were talking about but there is no point looking back at all of that now
7054336 i knew even before i came here that it would be worth it for me
7054337 we all knew when we came here that we may never have anything like this experience again so we are fortunate that everything went well and we won the gold medal
7054338 we had a lot of chances on goal but we didnt finish
7054339 that guy can do some magic create something out of nothing its just disappointing he didnt play
7054340 we are younger this time but the 1996 team actually won gold so youd say they are a better team
7054341 after gold i think silver is not bad look at brazil they came third
7054342 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7054343 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7054344 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7054345 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7054346 one of our favourite bands is fleetwood mac and you cant really pigeonhole them either

7054350 the construction and management of the toilets in a city reflects the level of civilization and living standards of a society
7054351 in the early 80s it struck me that the greatest cultural divide between my fellow american exchange students and the chinese was that the americans refused to use squat toilets in fact americans couldnt stop talking about the squat toilets they had a deep fear and loathing of them my sense is that the great squat vs sit debate is less about hygiene per se and more about style of bodily deportment for the most part westerners cant squat they arent used to squatting its difficult for them to squat perhaps westerners probably also perceive a squat toilet as making their body closer to that which they are trying to eliminate and my most indelicate observation a western meat based diet tends to make for more difficult more time consuming elimination in the end neither style of toilet is sanitary if its not flushed and not kept clean

7054391 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7054392 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night

7054462 would he then turn and sell it to the highest bidder
7054463 she describes it very well shes definitely describing joint pain
7054464 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7054465 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7054466 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7054467 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7054468 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7054469 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7054470 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump

7054486 i should have bought an esse years ago i talked my husband into buying one now he wont leave me alone hes always been attentive to my needs but things have definitely gone up several notches

7054490 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7054491 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7054492 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7054493 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7054494 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7054495 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7054496 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position

7054508 even though our outward man is perishing yet the inward man is being renewed day by day
7054509 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be

7054535 questo un alieno il ripensare alle nostre pazzie fatte mike buongiorno tu che ti addormentavi con la bocca aperta franci con le racchette del volano in mano e sempre tanto amore
7054536 een lid van groen links nl w duyvendak wiens publiek geworden criminele verleden voor veel ophef zorgt en uitvoerig wordt toegelicht met name wegens de verwevenheid met delen van de brede milieubeweging en laakbare handelingen daarvan
7054537 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
7054538 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie
7054539 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7054540 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7054541 there are more motorcycle riders on the road and there will be even more as long as gas stays near 4 a gallon
7054542 but the increase in ridership isnt the killer failure to wear a helmet is
7054543 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
7054544 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
7054545 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
7054546 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
7054547 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
7054548 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
7054549 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
7054550 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
7054551 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
7054552 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
7054553 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
7054554 i notice a lot more kids wearing obama t shirts
7054555 i would say its a pretty big trend across the nation and at the university of florida
7054556 in many ways the young people mirror what is happening to the electorate as a whole
7054557 even people who disagree with what were doing are still ready to register voters and bring people into the process
7054558 thats what happens when you bring 50 000 people with different backgrounds together
7054559 from the perspective of a 20 year old whether youre 47 or 71 youre still a heck of a lot older than we are
7054560 theyre more vocal now because they definitely have a chance to win
7054561 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
7054562 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
7054563 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7054564 this is unacceptable some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
7054565 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
7054566 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
7054567 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
7054568 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
7054569 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
7054570 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
7054571 its always important to reiterate this is a serious event
7054572 a tropical storm threatening to become a hurricane always puts things in perspective
7054573 what gov crist does is he sets the tone and lets his team do the work
7054574 there will be plenty of time to review gov crists performance once the storm has passed and floridians are out of harms way
7054575 from a black perspective it holds a great deal of meaning
7054576 what we read into it is we are further down the road to achieving dr kings dream
7054577 the feeling i got was so emotional i was on fire
7054578 that was 45 years ago and i can still remember where i was what i was doing when i heard kings speech if i live another 45 years i imagine i will remember the emotions i will feel when barack obama accepts the presidential nomination of the democratic party
7054579 for me it is the 40th anniversary of watching julian bond on stage being nominated for vice president
7054580 as a 16 year old seeing this handsome articulate black man made me think why cant he be vice president i joined the young democrats i saw the possibility in 1968
7054581 he gives me hope that the way government is now will change
7054582 in 2004 24 1 million people voted in the democratic primaries in 2008 primaries 56 million voted a lot of that was youth and a large percentage of that is black youth
7054583 in some states particularly in the south black young people are voting more than young whites
7054584 weve turned the corner in race relations if barack obama is elected
7054585 perhaps mccain should consider a bus tour through wal mart parking lots and obama could use target
7054586 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
7054587 afgezien daarvan edco hoort gewoon niet thuis in de meer
7054588 coalitiepartner pvda blijft tegen spreekt over verommeling van het landschap en zelfs van financi le bevoordeling van edco maar is niet van plan er een halszaak van te maken
7054589 de tweede buitenoefening kan ik gewoon kijken alles is helderder scherper kleuriger ik beleef alles intensiever
7054590 bij aankomst bij shambhala djoj waren al enkele mensen aanwezig en voelde ik direct een soort van herkenning een soort thuiskomen
7054591 but there are others who regret having bought the house at the price they paid and if they can get rid of the obligation of having to continue paying on it theyre happy to do it
7054592 theres no way we could have afforded a house before
7054593 my husband and i walked out of the closing jumped in the truck and just screamed
7054594 we had an awful lot of stretch buying above peoples means
7054595 everything happens for a reason now weve moved to a place where we can settle down survive and thrive
7054596 my feeling is that its easier now than it was six months ago and six months from now it will be easier than it is now
7054597 its much more beneficial to us because the bank doesnt have to take the hit
7054598 i was quite happy with the sale price although it was considerably less than what we had in it
7054599 much will be written about it in textbooks articles and essays long after were through this
7054600 then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7054601 because the seat opened in the fashion that it did and because we got a late start we entered the race in the midst of a significant amount of noise and activity by other campaigns
7054602 you almost get lost in the sign farms and the mailings
7054603 as a former elected official and aide to this house district i understand the awesome responsibility i am asking to champion
7054604 i am already working with current and future leaders of the legislature to build a conservative coalition that will put your interests first we are facing real challenges to our county and state together we can preserve and improve our quality of life
7054605 this difference is im not doing this because i want to be an important politician or an important person
7054606 im doing this as a civic duty to undo some of the wrongs that have been done
7054607 this campaign will cause stress in my life and will be a burden at times but i do feel my political beliefs are really what this state needs and we need more and more of good old fashioned ronald reagan republicans
7054608 will fight to keep the shuttle flying until orion comes online
7054609 over regulation and government intervention is a burden on the economy and can only serve to prolong the current slowdown
7054610 our big government has blown through reserves and trust funds and the only cure is to reduce the size and scope of government we simply can no longer afford to continue our current level of spending
7054611 citizens property insurance company needs to go back to what it was designed to do be the insurance of last resort
7054612 furthermore we need to focus on hardening and armoring our older and more susceptible structures through programs and incentives like my safe florida and tax free home improvements
7054613 moreover we must face up to the fact that living in coastal florida is a property liability and redistribution of risk costs is borderline socialism
7054614 those elected legislators who have failed the american people will pay for their lack of spine at the polls
7054615 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7054616 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7054617 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7054618 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
7054619 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
7054620 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
7054621 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
7054622 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
7054623 sen mccain knows us intimately so he knows our strengths as well as our weaknesses so that could play good and bad for us
7054624 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7054625 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
7054626 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7054627 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have
7054628 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7054629 we must do whatever it takes to help our domestic auto manufacturers remain competitive
7054630 he has always been there for us on auto issues
7054631 good god if i blow this there might never be a second
7054632 sent the crowd into a frenzy like a thunderbolt hit the theater
7054633 all of us who broke down barriers faced a lot of resistance but now hes trying to break down the biggest barrier of all ive got to tell you when youre in the middle of that its a very scary feeling
7054634 it says that when given the chance african americans can excel in even the most competitive of circumstances
7054635 you know what lets just leave the whole military record thing alone
7054636 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7054637 cindy is a private person and i think in many ways that defines her
7054638 shes never been a day to day manager in this business
7054639 delgado will tell her how much money they made so she can tell him how much shell take out
7054640 michigan was selected for that because we have been focused on alternative and renewable energy
7054641 whos holding this back its one man his name is mike bishop
7054642 its the governors failure to step up and lead thats the problem here despite what she says to her buddies in denver
7054643 the bottom line now is were all on the same page
7054644 thats part of what this convention is about outreach to working americans so they know hes fighting for them
7054645 i am concerned it will be raised in a swift boat kind of way
7054646 the psc targets arent ambitious enough to drive any kind of investment in renewable energy technology in florida
7054647 gov crist would be 94 before his proposed 20 percent target is realized
7054648 we were just flabbergasted by the 1 percent cost cap
7054649 you should expect to see 100 to 150 banks fail before the end of the year
7054650 the way they keep them is by paying a rate thats higher than the market its squeezing all the banks on top of asset problems that is making this a difficult period for banks
7054651 the 6 000 banks at the bottom of the industry dont have enough assets all together to equal one citibank
7054652 if 150 banks fail and they knock 20 billion in assets out of the system it doesnt matter
7054653 these stocks offer a once in a generation opportunity to make money
7054654 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
7054655 we can expect to see more bank failures but its not a repeat of the savings and loan crisis
7054656 that outlook isnt a cause for concern for individual savers provided that their funds are fully protected by deposit insurance
7054657 its not cool with the sort of rebellious punk street artist types to support something that is seen as a part of the system
7054658 obamas a rock star hes got a great brand and hes a very sexy candidate
7054659 its pretty unusual to find things that street artists and graffiti artists are in support of
7054660 i could go and volunteer at the campaign and make calls but thats probably not the best use of my skill set
7054661 a conscious effort to position obama in a certain way to position him as cool and to position him as hip
7054662 peoples incomes and wages are flat and their costs are rising
7054663 people are worried that if we dont deal with these issues now that our standard of living could if not decline at least remain stagnant
7054664 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7054665 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7054666 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7054667 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7054668 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7054669 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7054670 what we proposed 18 months ago would not fit the bill for what the air force is looking for
7054671 its very clear to us this is a new competition
7054672 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
7054673 i get a feeling that they are perhaps playing delay tactics
7054674 they could probably get even more time if say the democrats win
7054675 whether either of the contractors submits a proposal is entirely up to them
7054676 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
7054677 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs

7054766 our concern is that the purchase of u s sugar and the resulting evisceration of the industry and its economic base in clewiston represents an extreme slash and burn position
7054767 we think its important that somebody stands up and tries to preserve those jobs
7054768 having waged a war that has unleashed daily carnage and uncertainty in iraq we have to manage our exit in a responsible way with the hope of leaving a stable foundation for the future but at the very least taking care not to plunge the country into an even deeper and perhaps irreparable crisis
7054769 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7054770 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7054771 we missed that wave so were going to have to get started
7054772 and probably denver is the next place to do that
7054773 how many regular voters really care about some fat cats sitting in denver
7054774 you have people here who know the state it just makes sense to use them
7054775 it was a record turnout in a presidential preference primary that supposedly did not count
7054776 they feel like they have some skin in the game
7054777 we have been and continue to work together to find opportunities to raise money
7054778 very pleased that so many who supported sen clinton in the primary have taken active roles in the obama campaign
7054779 it is all political spin in reality you have to pay off your own debt
7054780 hillary and her supporters are going to have pay off her debt were going to have do it ourselves
7054781 the way to win is to outspend the other guy
7054782 the reason that i gave to sen clinton is because ultimately this is about overcoming differences
7054783 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7054784 in grado di rendere brillante e al contempo potente il suono nonch un

7054803 user reviews and comments that include profanity or personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be removed from the site
7054804 how predictable aspercream up at the crack of dawn running to the keyboard to run her usual inane patter complete with laziest form of argument the cut and paste of articles
7054805 no way hillary and no to all your supporters too
7054806 biden did say obama wasnt ready to be president but this happens all the time
7054807 the history of bidens gaffes however show the risks of naming him to the ticket
7054808 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7054809 condolisa are you joking the worst secretary of state to the worst president in history this is a joke right
7054810 blowhard could be just what obama needs charles hurt new york post
7054811 biden is horrendously arrogant has a temper that makes mccains look benign and keeps making racist remarks in restaurants stay tuned this is an accident waiting to happen
7054812 we do this the way it has always been done here
7054813 quit insulting the europeans they have every right to hate bush
7054814 and on top of that did not even consider or vet hillary who actually got the popular vote basically dissing her and her 18 million supporters
7054815 i believe that the mccain that doesnt try to impress people is a great candidate the problem is that mccain is nothing more than a puppet of opportunity hes just like a dog whose master makes him do 10 tricks in 10 seconds even worse hes a dog that listens to 10 masters
7054816 i noticed a comment just now about how obama got 200 000 people out in berlin what people dont realize is that the obama axelrod team used concerts as a backdrop for obamas rallies those screaming people were there before obama dropped by to give a speech
7054817 how many of the people showed up to hear obama and how many to hear the band
7054818 i voted to give the president the authority to use force in iraq i still believe my vote was just
7054819 comes from our gut moves through our heart and ends up in our head its almost genetic
7054820 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7054821 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east

7054823 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7054824 it turned out they iraq didnt have wmd but everyone in the world thought he saddam had them
7054825 i called every intelligence agency before the foreign relations committee had them all sit there at once
7054826 and mr president if all else fails you have authority to use force
7054827 over the course of his presidential bid biden cemented his reputation as how to put this nicely less than disciplined on the campaign trail
7054828 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7054829 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7054830 you know there will be three days in the campaign where someone in chicago will get a call and respond what did you say he said
7054831 mccain is the one that is clueless on national security hes been a champion of the iraq war he said pulling out of iraq was surrender guess what now we have a time table for pull out
7054832 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7054833 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7054834 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7054835 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7054836 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7054837 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7054838 yeah this guy thinks hes another harry truman to be appreciated in later years the guy had to have been a drunk to be so delusional he took this country to war over weapons of mass destruction and there were none great yeah a real great president
7054839 nope not true most of our european allies are conservatives who actually adore pres bush like sarkozy angela merkel berlusconi of italy all of them good friends of bush not to mention how he has revered in eastern europe
7054840 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
7054841 as president john mccain would nominate judges who understand that the role of the court is not to subvert the rights of the people by legislating from the bench critical to constitutional balance is ensuring that where state and local governments do act to preserve the traditional family the courts must not overstep their authority and thwart the constitutional right of the people to decide this question
7054842 this is not a new position for john mccain he has long held it it is reflected in his consistent opposition to the agenda of liberal judicial activists who have usurped the role of state legislatures in such matters as dealing with abortion and the definition of marriage it is reflected in his longstanding opposition to liberal opinions that have adopted a stance of active hostility toward religion rather than neutrality it is reflected in his firm support for the personal rights secured in the second amendment
7054843 john mccains judicial appointees will understand that the federal government was intended to have limited scope and that federal courts must respect the proper role of local and state governments the second principle is separation of powers his judicial appointees will understand that it is not their role to usurp the rightful functions and powers of the co equal political branches he will look for candidates who respect the lawmaking powers of congress and the powers of the president
7054844 john mccain believes that shaping the judiciary through the appointment power is one of the most important and solemn responsibilities a president has and certainly one that has a profound and lasting impact when he was running for president in 1999 he promised that in appointing judges he would not only insist on persons who were faithful to the constitution but persons who had a record that demonstrated that fidelity a president should have confidence in the judicial philosophy of those he is appointing to the bench that is why he strongly supported john roberts and samuel alito for the supreme court and that is why he would seek men and women like them as his judicial appointees
7054845 i might add obamas mansion with four fireplaces and a music room that he got on very favorable financial terms by his friend the convicted felon rezko we still dont know the whole story on the felon and obamas relationship just like with his friend the terrorist ayers
7054846 hillary clinton has the experience knowledge intelligence good judgement record of accomplishments winner of the peoples vote ready on day one doesnt need a crutch for a vp everything but they allowed this zero to come along and send his thugs into the caucuses to steal delegates using theft threats force and every kind of fraud imaginable
7054847 anonymous unfortunately youre too young to really know what youre talking about whatever else you may think of pres bush the man had loads of experience for the job as president he had been the governor for several years of a huge state which has a bigger domestic output than several medium sized european countries
7054848 men telling women what to do again just shut up and vote for obama screw you im voting for mccain
7054849 the kingfish and the senates resident village idiot a rank amateur with no resume and a hair plug devotee with diarrhea of the mouth what has become of the democratic party a zoo thats what
7054850 is he gen obama no no military background brilliant businessman obama no he never worked in business famous name obama no its a new name an unusual one longtime southern governor obama no hes a community organizer whats that then a lawyer boo then a state legislator so what sos my cousin then u s senator less than four years
7054851 at least i wont have to hold my nose and vote for obama if he had hillary on the ticket now i can vote for mccain with no smell of bo in the air
7054852 he just failed his second test first was saddleback the more the american people see of professor obama the less they like
7054853 the rich dont pay any taxes thats what tax attorneys are for
7054854 you have to be indian to be in a dunkin donuts
7054855 russian forces responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7054856 while the russian government has claimed that the georgian military was engaged in a genocide in the region of south ossetia biden said he did not see any evidence of it on his trip
7054857 in a democracy the people get the government they deserve
7054858 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7054859 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7054860 you know there will be three days in the campaign where someone in chicago will get a call and respond what did you say he said
7054861 bidens hair plugs pulled his brain off its moorings it makes him look bad and there is no way to leave feedback on his website so i am going public with my criticism here he is duller than watching paint dry he steals other peoples thoughts and makes them his own he had the audacity to think he could be president his mouth overloads his brain about 10 times per day he is a self proclaimed zionist he is an east coast entrenched politician who needs to be tossed asap
7054862 changing the face of washington huh a hole with one of the longest serving democratic senators huh
7054863 i am deeply disturbed that the obama campaign promised its supporters that they would be the first to know about the vp choice via text message apparently it was a bunch of bs since all the news sites already have biden as the vp i know this is a minor thing but it is one lie too many i am now a mccain supporter
7054864 i wonder if biden is going to admit that the
7054865 he saw the light at the end of the tunnel
7054866 now the democrats will have to deal with another kerry moment
7054867 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7054868 i voted for the iraq war first and then voted against it
7054869 i am john mccain i approved this message and i rest my case
7054870 hey the guy isnt that experienced but maybe thats what we need in a president i mean the
7054871 the anti intellectual presidency the decline of presidential rhetoric from washington to george w bush
7054872 i dont know two plagarists on the same ticket doesnt provide the balance it needs the question will arise is biden stealing obamas ideas or is obama stealing bidens ideas or do they have any original ideas on their own well see
7054873 the anti intellectual presidency the decline of presidential rhetoric from washington to george w bush
7054874 to avoid the media provocation in the high seas as they the organisers planned
7054875 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people
7054876 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted

7054933 im sorry this is so long i didnt have time to make it shorter
7054934 not to be too contrarian here but the technologies are certainly in place for this we just need to re engineer the people
7054935 as elliott masie pointed out over 10 years ago prarie doggins f2f or electronic is actually the most expensive form of training ever created
7054936 after re training our luckless worker our intrepid heroine decides to hold a webinar magically she can do this in 10 minutes in the world i live in it actually takes a fair amount of work to distill the learning into a 10 minute chunk
7054937 all of this starts with the stated assumption that the training and documentation folks are doing such a poor job that their work is useless to help a real person in a real job
7054938 mom and dad say i should make my life an example of the principles i believe in but every time i do they tell me to stop it

7054945 with the cheney nomination in 2000 he was considered the wise old man that the young brash george bush needed

7054948 based on my hunch that the genre has brought together several trends in contemporary hollywood film these trends which can commingle were around before 2000 but they seem to be developing in a way that has created a niche for the superhero film

7054958 our position is that we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
7054959 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
7054960 in order to have a base you need a decent navy ours is weak
7054961 a base is expensive to keep is it just to have a flag there a show of strength to scare

7054964 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures

7054966 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience

7054971 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
7054972 george bush and bin laden are two parts of the same seven headed dragon
7054973 the government did 911 to go to iraq and history repeats itself right on track
7054974 invasion and rape of monetary inflation that brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
7054975 by the authority vested in me by the state of insert state name here i pronounce you
7054976 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7054977 you cant expect people to be cheering in the streets if you have oil prices rising and food prices rising
7054978 i am totally focused on only one thing and that is taking this country through these difficult economic circumstances
7054979 the article is fine the publicity surrounding it is another thing
7054980 at call products will fall when the cash rate comes down so there is value in looking at term deposits
7054981 if you have cash that you want to save for a specific purpose you should lock it in now to ensure good returns for the period of the term
7054982 if you had 20 000 and you had a mortgage facility that allows you to make extra payments but also has a redraw facility the best strategy may be to put the money against the mortgage and redraw on it when required
7054983 firstly because you are reducing your debt and secondly because you are not liable to pay tax on the earned income
7054984 i think it might take a few cuts before it really affects property prices
7054985 in the interim potential buyers should be doing as much research as they can on the ground and working out what they can afford
7054986 its a good opportunity to see probable australian internationals and definitely the future queensland side for the super 14 for the following five or six years so theyll have very exciting players on show at the sportsground on tuesday night
7054987 were in pre season mode its important that everyone gets as much game time as they possibly can to put themselves in a position to get selected thats what this process is about
7054988 well reflect on the four pre season matches in total at the end of august and then select on the basis of those for the ospreys match
7054989 ik ben zelf verzot op film en vind het ontzettend eervol dat mijn allereerste boek filmmakers inspireert
7054990 het boek is avontuurlijk en spannend en gaat over personages die iets te verbergen hebben enigszins vergelijkbaar met mijn eerste film bella bettien in dat genre voel ik me thuis
7054991 annet de jong heeft veel research gedaan dat merk je ze gebruikt kleurrijke locaties en laat die loskomen van het papier je ziet het verhaal voor je zelfs nu er nog geen film is zelf kom ik al jaren op cura ao en voor mij is het daarom ook nog eens een feest van herkenning
7054992 and the discourse of co operation produced the unified system and the stereotypes of center periphery
7054993 toen hij weg was veegde stan de kalk van tafel en ging door met zijn pizza en als hij terug was van zon reis ging hij met zijn kinderen spelen of de auto wassen
7054994 dat soort verhalen had stan veel hij verzuchtte wel eens dat hij regelmatig goed is weggekomen
7054995 stan heeft in de bijna 25 jaar dat hij in het vak zit gruwelijke dingen gezien zijn harde schijf moest leeg zei hij zelf en op verjaardagen wilde hij niet steeds zijn verhalen vertellen lees mijn boek maar wilde hij kunnen zeggen er zou een dvd bij het boek k0men met de reportages die bij de verhalen hoorden
7054996 afgelopen zaterdag belde eerst de bbc of stan naar georgi wilde
7054997 maar dat weigerde hij daarna belde rtl stan had een raar gevoel in zijn maag hij wist dat het een heftige oorlog was maar toen hij had besloten te gaan had hij geen twijfel meer
7054998 stans eerste klus was het boomplanten in tilburg noord hij was een jaar of negentien toen hij voor het eerst meeging naar het buitenland de fluwelen revolutie in praag meen ik
7054999 waar we niet eens wisten wie tegen wie vocht je hebt geen tijd om je voor te bereiden op zon reis soms een paar uurtjes in het vliegtuig hoeveel ervaring je ook hebt geen oorlog is hetzelfde
7055000 voor zover ik weet nam stan geen onnodige risicos maar in dergelijke gebieden is het altijd gevaarlijk
7055001 we are half way through the reporting season and there have been some good results which helping in getting momentum
7055002 the overall market will benefit retailers will gain from increased confidence in the market from oil falling

7055013 esta automotora parece uma bailarina antes a m quina diesel que puxava as carruagens era melhor e mais segura
7055014 afinal o resultado n o t o tr gico como se disse n o morreu nenhuma crian a

7055020 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
7055021 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
7055022 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
7055023 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7055024 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7055025 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7055026 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
7055027 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
7055028 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff

7055030 weve entered gazan waters were flying the palestinian flag and we now believe that were going to reach the shores of gaza very soon i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks today is a huge victory of people over power
7055031 right now there are crack addicts all over the planet and none of them asked to be born or to be the victims of this very dangerous drug
7055032 well i could just punch up the colour a bit
7055033 he enjoys racing it in the camping world east series
7055034 hes been running it some we might do it in nationwide but i dont have any intention anywhere else
7055035 who do you think is more qualified to be president you or obama qould love to hear his answer what you guys think hed say
7055036 youll just have to buy my book to find out
7055037 im on the clock and youre not im just going to chill the only thing im going to make any effort towards is hurting you because youre interrupting my rest and annoying me all my union breatheren are going to jump in and hurt you too
7055038 soft words turn away wrath while grievous words stir up anger most all people are effected so lying to someone blatantly is also a reason people get angry you insult their intelligence and bring it on yourself
7055039 who do you think is more qualified to be president you or obama qould love to hear his answer what you guys think hed say
7055040 but this is the new covenant i will make with the people of israel on that day
7055041 i will put my instructions deep within them and i will write them on their hearts i will be their god and they will be my people 34 and they will not need to teach their neighbors nor will they need to teach their relatives saying you should know the l ord for everyone from the least to the greatest will know me already
7055042 and i will forgive their wickedness and i will never again remember their sins
7055043 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe
7055044 he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7055045 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7055046 it was very tough for me to get here but it has all been worth it
7055047 finally everything has turned out fine even after all the problems people were talking about but there is no point looking back at all of that now
7055048 i knew even before i came here that it would be worth it for me
7055049 we all knew when we came here that we may never have anything like this experience again so we are fortunate that everything went well and we won the gold medal
7055050 we had a lot of chances on goal but we didnt finish
7055051 that guy can do some magic create something out of nothing its just disappointing he didnt play
7055052 we are younger this time but the 1996 team actually won gold so youd say they are a better team
7055053 after gold i think silver is not bad look at brazil they came third
7055054 wie het antwoord weet op de volgende vraag mag naar huis
7055055 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7055056 to see how much bs we could get the kool aid drinkers to believe it looks like a lot more than we anticipated i mean cmon who would believe that we would really announce this on a saturday if it were true
7055057 whoever the lucky guy or gal is will get a speaking slot at the end just before the janitors start sweeping the floors
7055058 after being elected to the u s first thoughts its joe biden
7055059 je bent met n oog bijziend en met n oog verziend het is niet dramatisch maar tijdens computerwerk en autorijden is het wel verstandig wanneer je een bril gaat dragen om je ogen te ontlasten want die moeten nu wel erg hard werken
7055060 je moet niets het enige dat je moet is ademen
7055061 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
7055062 if the bible is not true and authoritative on the roles of men and women then maybe the bible will not be finally true on premarital sex the homosexual issue adultery or any other moral issue
7055063 i believe this issue is the carrier of a virus by which liberalism will enter the evangelical church
7055064 taking this step has kind of rattled a lot of peoples cages
7055065 were culturally and historically specific not universal principles for all times and places
7055066 an ethic in progress leading to full freedom for women to exercise their giftedness in the local church
7055067 there are great theologians in the conservative evangelical world who come down on both sides
7055068 i do want us to be loving in our disagreement theres something powerful in that
7055069 our staff have had a very difficult time and theyre trying to work through their feelings he said
7055070 we are going through the same grieving process as many people in sydney although because theyve been up close and personal with this little whale i think its more real for them
7055071 ich k nnte mir sehr gut vorstellen dass angesichts der aufgaben die vor georgien liegen ein treffen auf einer bestimmten ebene der eu mit den nachbarschaftsstaaten stattfinden k nnte
7055072 nach den uns vorliegenden informationen hat russland seinen r ckzug aus georgien begonnen aber nicht vollst ndig abgeschlossen
7055073 wir m ssen jetzt aus dem immer noch sehr fragilen zustand einen dauerhaften waffenstillstand machen
7055074 sie haben sich nicht vollst ndig aus den gegenden zur ckgezogen die als nicht umstritten gelten
7055075 fortgesetzt und gem den verpflichtungen der russischen seite beendet werden
7055076 wir haben einen guten text aber wir haben noch harte verhandlungen vor uns
7055077 der erhalt von georgiens territorialer einheit ist unvorstellbar ohne eine echte internationalisierung der friedenstruppe
7055078 ich konnte mir nicht vorstellen dass es ein derart gro angelegter feindlicher einfall werden w rde
7055079 they had me up on ladders with rollers doing shots she said
7055080 they made us stay 10 to 12 hours a day for the three days and usually we were there five hours a day so it was a massive change to our normal schedule
7055081 i just got so upset because they were basically not letting me leave she said
7055082 coming into the ice cream shop that was ridiculous i dont know what they hoped to achieve by coming around the back of the counter it was like they thought they were on some dramatic tv show its just a cooking show
7055083 they didnt get the angle they wanted with my bosses so they were pretty much scrambling for any bit of excitement they could get from it and i guess that just happened to be it
7055084 she came into the shop and the next thing we know theyre through the front filming us so ive taken her out the back into the store area she said
7055085 then one of them comes through the front behind the counter and bails up my 16 year old daughter while ive got a pregnant sasha out the back
7055086 i thought she was going to have a miscarriage she was so distressed it was disgusting absolutely disgusting
7055087 the police went and told them to pull their heads in because they had no right they never apologised nothing
7055088 id agreed to do the show but it was like theyd never known a pregnant person before
7055089 they didnt make any allowance for it and it would have been nice if theyd been more considerate of me needing more of a break than everyone else
7055090 it doesnt appear that they were particularly wealthy detective inspector mark newham said garry and donald keyte declined to comment when approached by
7055091 were just devastated they have absolutely devastated our family she said
7055092 they have taken away a mother a father a nan and a pop
7055093 dear mum and dad we love you we miss you forever together garry and karen
7055094 there are a lot of rumours in town obviously people talk about it but its our job to determine whether they are just rumours or what may have some truth to it he said
7055095 but the hensley family wealth from its rough and tumble origins to prominence in arizonas corporate world is also the fortune that propelled
7055096 somethings not right about this if you look through his inventory he has way to much high end beckett graded things he either works there and is grading it himself or he has someone on the inside heping sic him theres sic no way someone could have that many high end things just by luck
7055097 i wonder if this is too good to be true
7055098 american experts are the problem they were wrong about the soviet union and wrong about iraq
7055099 scholars need to validate the status quo or they lose their funding
7055100 with a vocal muslim country on every border georgia was a natural ally of bushs so called war on terror though i did not meet any georgian who agreed with american policy
7055101 desert wasteland scrubby bushes and dusty boulders an emptiness of lizards and a landscape like cat litter
7055102 who wants to hear people boasting about their greed and promiscuity
7055103 i really cant have people over and i have to be quiet when i do
7055104 my parents want to know where im going every minute of every day
7055105 as your kids get older you really get to enjoy their company
7055106 i wish she could find a job a half mile away
7055107 but you have to pat yourself on the back that she can pick up and go
7055108 n o temos tempo para ficar lamentando entramos um pouco desligados no primeiro tempo contra o flamengo melhoramos no segundo mas eles deram sorte e marcaram no fim agora buscar pontos contra o n utico
7055109 o resultado n o foi bom mas a gente tem que aprender que futebol assim mesmo ainda somos l deres
7055110 o nosso time tem que jogar sempre com a corda esticada n o podemos relaxar nunca porque o campeonato est muito equilibrado e esses cinco pontos de vantagem s o apenas uma gordurinha alertou tcheco
7055111 i am releasing someone charged with attempted murder in a drug deal a drug war where the other person allegedly started the war
7055112 im releasing them into our streets please be careful hope that nobody else gets hurt but remember the fight is between the public advocacy office and the state senate who dont seem to care enough to protect us they should put that stuff aside and protect us
7055113 if i were to ignore that 10 day rule then weve got guantanamo bay wed never have counsel i could keep them in jail forever and theyd never have a trial because we cant take them to trial without counsel
7055114 the fundamental duty of the judiciary is to protect public safety it is incomprehensible that judge popovich would release an individual who he acknowledges is dangerous because of his failure to conduct a timely preliminary hearing the judge has at his disposal the statutory authority to protect the public and a full investigation should be conducted by the judicial removal and retirement commission as to his rash actions disregarding the public safety and his bizarre explanation thereof
7055115 he always spent more time talking to my father they were talking architecture and meeting people
7055116 i didnt have a real close connection to him he was always very busy and didnt have a lot of time for a young boy
7055117 i didnt know anything about it until the restoration started
7055118 its a very good design certainly a very good example of those houses
7055119 in high school i began to realize how important he was i began to open my eyes at that point
7055120 there are always questions you have when a loved one dies
7055121 there are so many questions i would have liked to ask
7055122 the reality is not the building itself its the space within the building
7055123 at the same time he had a very charismatic quality he was a marvelous talker when i was with him many of his lectures were just spontaneous
7055124 to be present and working in the now right now
7055125 it was the same week my grandson was born premature at 26 weeks
7055126 i just decided that life is too short not to do what youve always wanted to do so why not do it while you can
7055127 my painting class is the best group of about 10 people we come from all walks of life we laugh we paint we eat its just so much fun

7055129 en tant que pr sident temporaire du conseil de s curit des nations unies le fait que nous ayons une ligne de communication ouverte au plus haut niveau avec la chine est crucial
7055130 pour une r solution quilibr e sur loss tie du sud qui puisse cr er un cadre clair pour la poursuite des op rations de maintien de la paix et des pourparlers long terme
7055131 vu les divergences de points de vue sur le contenu dune telle r solution au sein du conseil de s curit des nations unies csnu en particulier entre les usa et la russie le r le dinterm diaire de la belgique et le poids diplomatique de la chine peuvent tre d cisifs

7055133 we thought wed do well but weve surpassed sydney and athens
7055134 i was talking to someone with the australian broadcaster who said their ratings for beijing are greater than their ratings for their own sydney olympics
7055135 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7055136 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7055137 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7055138 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7055139 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just too play our own game
7055140 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7055141 thats disrespect i dont know where theyre going with that
7055142 im not happy with the way the judges scored the fight but thats it he won and hes got the gold medal
7055143 its more than a function hes a man i have learned to appreciate
7055144 con algunos prejuicios sobre que se hacen monjas las chicas menos atractivas
7055145 fotos bonitas y expresivas que muestren la belleza tanto en el plano est tico como espiritual
7055146 una monja santa inteligente pero tambi n guapa puede dar mucho en la misi n de la evangelizaci n y de la pastoral juvenil
7055147 vivimos en tiempos en los que la visibilidad es muy importante y puede servir a las monjas para que se conozca su instituto o el carisma de una fundaci n religiosa
7055148 la imagen que se tiene de que las monjas son mujeres tristes desilusionadas de la vida y no realizadas
7055149 sie konnten geld verleihen ohne gesch fts bliche beschr nkungen sie hatten einen blanko scheck von der regierung

7055156 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7055157 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7055158 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7055159 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7055160 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7055161 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7055162 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7055163 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7055164 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
7055165 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7055166 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7055167 if you trust every web site but not a government
7055168 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7055169 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7055170 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7055171 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
7055172 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
7055173 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
7055174 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7055175 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran

7055182 w hrend die hijacker hier waren taten sie alles um unter dem radar zu bleiben sie kontaktierten keine bekannten terror sympathisanten
7055183 die grundlage f r vieles gelegt was im wei en haus schief lief in den wochen und monaten vorm 11 september
7055184 st rkeres brauche etwas dass den dramatischen bruch mit den ideen der vergangenheit besser repr sentiert
7055185 sie bef rchteten wir w rden mit dem finger auf jemanden zeigen mitten im wahlkampf aber die vielen reporte die wir produzierten waren nicht dazu da jemanden zu h ngen
7055186 wir wissen bis heute nicht warum uns norad erz hlt hat was es uns erz hlt hat aber es war so fern der wahrheit eins dieser losen enden die nie verbunden wurden
7055187 willentlich war oder nur aus dem nebel stupider b rokratie heraus geschah
7055188 das verfolgen von b rokraten weil sie die kommission irre geleitet haben f r mich keinen sinn
7055189 haben sie unsere untersuchung behindert die antwort ist ein klares ja ob dies ein verbrechen ist dar ber m ssen andere urteilen
7055190 uns wurden keine aufnahmen bergeben oder selbst deren existenz eingestanden die kommission hat auch keine transkripte von diesen aufnahmen erhalten
7055191 es gab keinen weg die glaubw rdigkeit der aussagen zu berpr fen
7055192 wie k nnen wir sagen ob jemand wie kahlid sheikh mohamed die wahrheit sagt
7055193 wir berlassen es dem leser des kommissions berichts die glaubw rdigkeit dieser quellen zu beurteilen wir hatten dazu keine gelegenheit
7055194 die meisten leute sehen den bericht der kommission als ein vertrauensw rdiges historisches dokument an wenn die schlussfolgerungen auf informationen basieren die wiederum auf folter basieren dann sind die schlussfolgerungen selbst suspekt
7055195 wie alle juristen wissen das vernichten von beweisen l sst die schuld derjenigen vermuten die die beweise vernichtet haben bush und cheney haben die regierung bei der zerst rung von 9 11 beweisen gef hrt folglich m ssen sie die beweise f r die ursachen des 11 septembers bringen oder weiter die anschuldigungen einer gr er werdenden anzahl von menschen ertragen der 11 september sei ein inside job gewesen
7055196 wir k nnen keine freispr che haben es muss verurteilungen geben
7055197 die hijacker hinterlie en keine spur in unserer untersuchung haben wir nicht ein einziges st ck papier entdeckt weder hier noch in afghanistan wo wir eine wahre goldgrube an informationen fanden dass irgendeinen aspekt des 11 september plots erw hnt h tte sie kleideten sich wie amerikaner und f hrten sich auch so auf sie gingen einkaufen und essen an orten wie wal mart und pizza hut sie schafften es verwundbare stellen in unserem system auszunutzen um au er sicht zu bleiben und weihten niemanden au erhalb eines sehr kleinen geschlossenen kreises ein
7055198 ein blinder hund h tte folgen k nnen so dick dass das fbi glaubte die hijacker wollten erkannt werden
7055199 was denken sie warum die regierung so schnell in der lage war die 19 hijacker zu identifizieren sie wurden durch die papiere im gep ck identifiziert und darum wissen wir dass al qaida hinter den anschl gen steckt
7055200 mit diesem bizarren testament und dem fahrplan f r die ermittlungen warum existieren die taschen warum waren sie nicht mit kleidung und waschzeug bepackt
7055201 welche spur auch immer hinterlassen wurde sie wurde absichtlich hinterlassen damit das fbi drauf st t
7055202 gerichtsf higen beweise ber die identit t der entf hrer
7055203 wir haben nicht gesagt wo die berreste der hijacker sind weil es nicht wichtig ist
7055204 sein job war es daf r zu sorgen dass die piloten ausgebildet und f hig waren
7055205 punkt f r punkt ber die spanne von zehn gerichts sitzungen bewies raissis anwalt dass alle anschuldigungen und die beweise auf denen sie sich st tzten falsch waren wenn nicht sogar fabriziert

7055258 here comes the orator with his flood of words and his drop of reason
7055259 npp government could not fulfill the promises they made to ghanaians before they were voted into office and have also mismanaged the affairs of the country so they must be voted out
7055260 a well informed electorate an asset to our fledgling democracy
7055261 we wish to conclude that what the ndc needs is grace and this no man can give them the earlier they confronted the truth squarely the better for them
7055262 we cannot repeat here the insults that dr ampofo poured on our president and i dont intend to pay him in his own coin
7055263 but we also know that all these efforts were to no avail
7055264 it pleased god to bring forth to us this otherwise hidden treasure during president kufuors tenure in office
7055265 but the grace of god played the greater role and president kufuor acknowledges this everyday
7055266 we can understand the frustration that comes when failure attends to all your efforts
7055267 it is common knowledge that oil exploration in ghana began as far back as 1893 we all know that from the colonial governments up until now under president kufuor every government has endeavored to explore for oil in this country we are aware of the efforts the pndc ndc made in this area over their 19 long years in office but we also know that all these efforts were to no avail
7055268 the existing system of selection has deficiency in terms of stamping its authority on decisions that affects its people
7055269 these deficiencies against the effectiveness and the viability of the house and the quality of democracy
7055270 polls will be conducted in a manner similar to that of the national general elections and those who emerge victorious will then become bonafide members of the ecowas parliament for four years term
7055271 under the reign of nkrumahs convention peoples party there emerged a dramatic break from the previous time when the stabilization principle that was the raison d tre for the establishment of the cocoa marketing board had been vitiated into a fiscal tool of government for taxing the cocoa farmers for the industrialization push of president nkrumah the damnable result of this practice had been that the portion of the world fob free on board price of cocoa that went to the farmer hovered around 27 for decades
7055272 the museums that like bees ranging over a broad field pollinate the world with the art history and culture of its constituent regions the elgin marbles were carved in athens and the rosetta stone was found in egypt but they are now displayed at the british museum in london the pergamon altar was built by the greeks removed from what is now turkey and is on view in berlin
7055273 cano has done a fine job as in many briefs cuno makes his key points more than once and perhaps too often but they are points worth making that all consequential culture becomes international and all culture should therefore be shared with the world not hoarded for reasons of skewed nationalism or out of desire for tourism revenues in the places where artifacts were made or just happened to have been dug up
7055274 the most telling part of cunos thesis is his warning that the impulse to hoard antiquity is related to the perils of excessive nationalism
7055275 although cuno is too gracious to drill his argument through the next level that the final stop on the line to nationalism is facism and that the result of ethnic and religious purity is all too often persecution and worse the implications cannot be ignored
7055276 cuno calls for an expansive view by which nations understand that all countries are built and maintained with foreign influences and that the worlds store of antiquities needs to be shared so that that process can continue it is that enduring humanist message more than the law and the politics recounted by cuno that makes his book compelling
7055277 so we have egypt a country both arab and muslim claiming national ownership of all antiquities from the age of the pharaohs and china claiming rights to works by ancient populations that werent even chinese such as the uighurs of the province of xinjiang who were a mix of mongol and indo european peoples

7055340 the mystery to me is the widespread assumption that obama is a progressive
7055341 that these positions are now coming into view is not evidence of a centrist shift it is evidence that obamas bare record contains many longstanding issue commitments that should be and should have been alarming to progressives
7055342 the material for this book was originally published as a series of six separate booklets beginning in 1955
7055343 the company distributed about 900 000 booklets free to the public to increase practical knowledge of range plants it has been recognized as one of the finest contributions to understanding rangeland management
7055344 in revising the text i wanted to include up to date information yet retain as much of the original essence as possible
7055345 the original text was written to be practical and it included descriptions livestock and wildlife recommendations distribution information and some cultural facts presented with minimal technical jargon
7055346 but its more its fhsus way of reinforcing the importance of grasslands and plants that support the great plains
7055347 even though very few are currently achieving it the level of activity that has been shown to help prevent cancer is not out of reach for most americans
7055348 it really comes down to making a commitment to getting the heart rate up for a sustained amount of time every day
7055349 for most americans it just means getting off the couch and becoming a bit more active more often
7055350 in the end it doesnt matter what activities you choose
7055351 theres an important message about health that men arent hearing yet
7055352 women maybe more informed about breast cancer and the factors that help prevent it but the aicr expert report found convincing evidence that physical activity helps prevent colorectal cancer the third most common cancer in both men and women in the u s

7055359 end this war in a way that we are able to ultimately to bring our troops home and leave a stable iraq behind that is consistent with the iraqi constitution
7055360 the form of a statement by the iraqi parliament on this issue in view of the fact that enacting a legislation could take a long time
7055361 only aimed to cause iraq to slide into the pits of a civil war only god knows when it will end
7055362 it is the duty of all the national powers in iraq to reject such an insolent resolution and to quickly announce their positions in the face of this trivializing with the sovereignty of iraq
7055363 not an attempt to embarrass the president its an attempt to save the president from making a significant mistake with regard to our policy in iraq
7055364 you dont need anything else but what i have to offer
7055365 it is always nice to be on top but especially nice after a bad result like that and especially after the way that it happened
7055366 there were only three laps to go and i had the race in my pocket
7055367 so after such a race it is nice to be here and have that feeling to be back on top again i did a great first sector and it was perfect so i knew i could take pole and the team did a really great job
7055368 it is nice to put that last race behind me now
7055369 to be on the front row is good the team did a great job and i am happy
7055370 when i saw felipes lap and his first sector time i knew he had killed the rest of us for pole so i am happy to be up the front
7055371 i know they ferrari are going to be very hard to beat tomorrow sunday but we are going to do our best and i think we have a very competitive package to do so
7055372 i found it quite slippery out there so maybe we have to look very carefully at our tyres
7055373 the sixth inning on it seemed like it took forever
7055374 i kissed a girl was inspired when i opened up a magazine and i saw a picture of scarlett johansson i was with my boyfriend at the time and i said to him im not going to lie if scarlett johansson walked into the room and wanted to make out with me i would make out with her i hope youre okay with that

7055384 no penile mutilation in my threads the penis is an object of worship not sacrifice
7055385 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
7055386 i want to get drug tested over and over again
7055387 obviously its inconvenient but i tell you what its inconvenient if people affect you by cheating
7055388 test me as much as you need to and follow me around as much as you need to
7055389 i think about the 99 9 per cent of athletes that are clean so we have to make sure that we keep the playing field level im very happy with the many tests that were taken before and during the games
7055390 we are telling the cheats there wont be a possibility to cheat anymore
7055391 athletes know that at this event the ioc which is the organization running the doping programs means business when it comes to not having those who cheat be part of this event
7055392 i wouldnt want to find out that one of the guys i was racing against doesnt get drug tested on a regular basis because i certainly do i offer my urine to any takers that can see it so that they know that im a clean athlete and i follow the rules
7055393 i live and breathe and die by the rules of this sport and cherish drug free sport more than anything because i think cheating is just a total demolition of the construct on which sport was based it disgusts me to think that people would cheat so im absolutely happy to provide my sample at any time
7055394 were making progress but we need to change our culture too
7055395 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us
7055396 wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7055397 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7055398 its good to have at least one car in q3 which weve missed for quite some races both drivers did a good job unfortunately kazuki just missed out on his first q3 by the smallest of margins the important thing now is to prepare for the race and make sure were happy with our strategy were looking forward to tomorrow

7055406 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7055407 ive had a great relationship with indian americans in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7055408 we will have to analyze the opinion more carefully and talk to the attorney generals office
7055409 i can say that this is probably the most heinous murder case ive seen
7055410 even though we ask pastors and youth ministers to spend time with our son andrew and give him an opportunity to talk they didnt
7055411 the speaker thats going to have the most to say will be our son who is 15 now because he has had a very very difficult time with this
7055412 our presentation is how we didnt have that support and how it could have helped us
7055413 for american indian and alaskan natives medical well being cant be separated from their spiritual well being they go hand in hand its not seen as a separate concern its very much integrated into their sense of well being in all areas of their life
7055414 there is so much that a spiritual leader in a community can do for patients and their families
7055415 it will dispel a lot of thats whats done in the hospital
7055416 when people are living with a life threatening illness they often feel cut off and they often cut themselves off
7055417 leaders in faith communities can help people find ways to reconnect with themselves with god with their own spirituality with whatever they see as the greater universe that is out there
7055418 we all know that every illness that you get physically has impacts on who we are our psyches and spiritual well beings
7055419 thats not something that doctors can address as well as the people in faith communities especially faith leaders
7055420 a lot of medical doctors these days are publicly acknowledging the importance of faith in how people cope with medical problems of various kinds and ultimately how the families will cope with death and bereavement
7055421 if you have no idea how to control that chaotic scene it will eat you up
7055422 they are doing a much better job of managing it
7055423 the steam couldnt come out it made the water tank become like a bomb or a rocket
7055424 when i came back i was eating my breakfast and i saw the fire
7055425 somebody was knocking on my window trying to get me to come out
7055426 it is kind of strange im surprised by how many fires happen in this area
7055427 i have a vision of what i want to have america look like internationally
7055428 listen you want to do that ive got 18 000 good ideas heres where they might fit in and youre welcome to all of them all i want to do is see it happen

7055433 i swear to the mother of baal you cant make up stuff this bad its like the self congratulation and the self contradiction are competing with each other
7055434 we have not done a thing illegally without city approval
7055435 ive lived in this neighborhood my whole life the last thing i want to do is rock the boat
7055436 we were told it would look like the subdivision down the street
7055437 we will support our president and we will support our troops
7055438 the only way we lose this election is not to engage this issue head on
7055439 the case against mccain and bush on national security is so overwhelming it should be an essential part of the case for the democratic nominee
7055440 rudy giuliani today has taken the politics of fear to a new low and i believe americans are ready to reject those kind of politics americas mayor should know that when it comes to 9 11 and fighting terrorists america is united
7055441 the irony is rudy giuliani probably the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency is here talking about any of the people here
7055442 rudy giuliani i mean think about it rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7055443 i have not selected him as i do not think that he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7055444 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game i shall talk to the player tomorrow he is our player and we shall work with him at training

7055449 every track we tried to follow seemed to lead to a dead end
7055450 so i grabbed some bracken and made a bed for the night ruby kept me warm and i kept her warm its most likely she saved my life
7055451 i was shivering violently it was very very cold and it occurred to me that i might not make it but i put that thought out of my mind and told myself i am walking out of here and i am taking ruby with me
7055452 she headed off behind some thick undergrowth when we started walking in the morning
7055453 i kept calling out to her but she was gone
7055454 she saved my life so i wanted to return the favour and save her we just love her
7055455 its been pretty intense everythings worked out but it could have easily gone the other way
7055456 dom was more worried about ruby than himself he wanted to look for her instead of going to the hospital
7055457 if he didnt have the dog with him certainly the outcome could have been substantially more serious in fact who knows how serious the weather up there was well below zero
7055458 we are developing a product that handles images but i cannot make any comment on specific plans
7055459 i said at the start of the season this is a watershed year for the club we cant finish this year waiting for potential to happen even our own juniors who we thought might go another level who havent
7055460 its time to bite the bullet and look for some players to improve the club that will be a plan over the next 18 months
7055461 ive got two years left if im not hung out to dry so were going to have to make a conscious decision of changing quite a few players in the club
7055462 we righted the ship but we were still a little bit loose in our defence hasler said
7055463 i think oxs form has been great the past few weeks i havent heard any of those comments so im not going to comment on that
7055464 its disappointing frustrating i dont know what other words can describe it shattering farah said
7055465 weve had three years to improve on 2005 but to win the comp and then not make the semis i think changes have to be made
7055466 i dont know what sort of changes but you cant just keep doing the same thing and come up with the same result
7055467 unless we want to lose the 20 billion economy of the shore and do it for a lot less energy than wed get for pursuing the renewable energy tax credits then i think drilling doesnt make a lot of sense
7055468 if you ask do you support drilling in order to lower gas prices people will say yes of course that implies drilling will lower gas prices which is false we have an education job to do
7055469 when i voted against the iraq war it was unpopular at the time but it was the right thing to do and people came to understand that
7055470 i think theyll understand that looking to renewable energy sources that can give us 6 million barrels of equivalent energy a day versus only 200 000 barrels with drilling without the risk to our shore and our economy will be the right choice

7055493 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7055494 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7055495 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7055496 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7055497 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank

7055504 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7055505 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7055506 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7055507 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7055508 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7055509 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7055510 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7055511 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7055512 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7055513 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7055514 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7055515 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7055516 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7055517 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7055518 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7055519 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7055520 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7055521 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7055522 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7055523 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7055524 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7055525 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7055526 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7055527 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7055528 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7055529 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7055530 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7055531 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7055532 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7055533 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7055534 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7055535 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7055536 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7055537 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

7055548 more than half a century ago the democrats held their national political convention in chicago
7055549 they took a roll call to decide their presidential nominee couldnt come to an agreement took a second ballot still were deadlocked and finally on the third try selected governor adlai stevenson of illinois as their choice for the white house in 1952
7055550 but not once in the next 56 years has an american political party taken a second ballot for president not once since then has an american political party started its national convention without knowing the identity of its presidential nominee
7055551 not once in that time has anything happened at an american political convention that has had anything but a harmful effect on the party concerned or on the country
7055552 a political institution with pure american roots and with an inherent sense of theatre has become a big dud
7055553 u s political conventions have become the appendix of the body politic a vestige of something that once had a function but no longer does and yet they endure against all reason
7055554 without them u s political parties themselves would hardly exist the parties come together after all only once every four years at these gigantic conclaves and there they vote on nearly meaningless manifestos that are neither paid attention to nor remembered a week later
7055555 they endure because reporters and news executives like to spend a week at a showy glittery anachronism that h l mencken celebrated for their colourful mischief and irresistible sideshows their utter vulgarity and utter stupidity
7055556 this years conventions will be choreographed with precision no opportunities for mischief no margin for error no unscripted moments
7055557 the beijing olympics organized by communists who believe in centralized planning have provided more occasions for spontaneity and at least in beijing no one has known in advance who would win

7055566 of 532 children who lost both parents in the earthquake 240 were under the age of 14 most of them had their grandparents or other relatives as guardians only 88 orphans currently need care
7055567 the status of orphan can only be determined with death certificates of both parents which should be given by police or hospital departments those whose parents are missing must wait for a court to declare their parents dead after two years
7055568 the financial aid in cash and flexible financial structures have created loopholes in adoption
7055569 it has offered opportunities for unhealthy relations between international adoption agencies and the orphanages
7055570 we are very worried with the recent fake adoption documents we had been confident about the legitimacy of documents appraised by police but in recent cases in nam dinh province there were fakes which police appraised
7055571 barack you cant give up the seat on the un security to kenya
7055572 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
7055573 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
7055574 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
7055575 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
7055576 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
7055577 you can swim all day in the sea of knowledge and never get wet
7055578 the slow movement forward in this regard was due to the political instability in pakistan which now is over with the installation of a democratically set up government there

7055580 the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
7055581 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
7055582 ensure that it india protects the right to life in accordance with its responsibilities under international law
7055583 now people want freedom from indian occupation the land issue is a thing of the past neither is there any need to talk about this issue nor would i ever talk on the subject to the shri amarnath yatra sangarsh samiti
7055584 what kind of freedom do we have now the freedom to be raped by indian soldiers
7055585 as an athlete i tried to concentrate on the competition
7055586 i finally was able to talk to them and i found out they were safe
7055587 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
7055588 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
7055589 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics
7055590 absolutely no doubt about it but the key is to stay within yourself not get too up or too down just try to take one day at a time the important thing to remember is that the olympics is not a sprint but a marathon
7055591 any medal would be exciting especially gold mongolia has never won gold
7055592 and theres only so many to win if theyre winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7055593 its an artificial criteria totally opposed to the olympic philosophy
7055594 chinas performance in the olympics reflects chinas true strength and status in the world nowadays
7055595 china can pat itself on the back and say weve done a good job
7055596 i dont think theyll be any significant change either in the way they govern or the way they manage their international image
7055597 china has expanded her international influence in the world and enhanced her image on the international stage
7055598 i hope this is a sputnik moment for the united states because china is rising fast and has big ambitions
7055599 the olympics experience of china is a symbol of something much bigger and thats a change of the international order
7055600 we dont know what a post american world will look like
7055601 the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7055602 the chinese culture always emphasizes the concept of harmony so if it can be resolved through mediation and the divorce is withdrawn then everybody is very happy about that
7055603 other countries may not think that is very good but in china we think it is a good thing

7055610 theyre all seriously worried that its georgia today and one of them tomorrow
7055611 poland and the us signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
7055612 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the us and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict

7055614 it took me a long time to realize that if i leave them a well thought out voice mail theyll ignore it

7055623 5 stars because i was there for the yelp elite event last night and made the place look good
7055624 some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will if thats the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it

7055628 missing from israels security framing is the very fact of occupation which israel both denies exists and that security requires israel control over the entire country rendering impossible a just peace based on human rights international law reconciliation
7055629 we need to expose israel as the regional superpower and necessary component in the american empire that it really is its economy is three times larger than egypt palestine jordan syria and lebanon put together israel is not the little david of the area but actually the goliath

7055631 we were told that we had to wait until after the games to find out if there were some left over that we could wear
7055632 unfortunately we are still waiting on news to find out if we will be racing in the lzrs said austin who will be competing at his third paralympics
7055633 i would definitely prefer to race in the lzr we raced in them at the trials so it would be very disappointing if we didnt get to race in them at the games the meet of our career

7055636 speedo has done an awesome job to meet the worldwide demand for the lzr racers and fulfilling their commitments to the paralympic team
7055637 it has always been the arrangement to supply the paralympic team with the suit they will definitely get them by the time the games begin

7055641 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure is not without complications this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
7055642 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement due in this case to a genetic disorder long term follow up is needed to assess the risks linked to the immunogenicity of allogenic composite tissues particularly as regards life expectancy following this initial success other patients are currently being assessed
7055643 to answer the many technical functional immunological and psychological questions raised by face transplantation
7055644 the definition of the best indications eg trauma malformations benign tumours burns will also greatly benefit from this cooperation the international registry on hand and composite tissue transplantation would be an ideal forum to help solve these challenges and define new indications our main objective is to give back a normal life to disfigured patients

7055656 they were very polite and told everyone in advance about the party and the possibility of some noise
7055657 one bloke even got invited and went along and said it was great
7055658 who would have believed that we would reach such achievements they are reality now
7055659 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
7055660 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
7055661 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
7055662 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
7055663 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
7055664 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
7055665 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
7055666 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
7055667 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
7055668 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
7055669 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
7055670 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
7055671 my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
7055672 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
7055673 i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found
7055674 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr suskind in his book i do speak to discussions regarding using habbush which were frequent during that period but what i was talking about was the possibility of using him to tamp down the insurgency not to influence western public opinion
7055675 an order such as the one outlined by mr suskind would have been a huge event and in my opinion illegal an order to fabricate such a document would have been rejected out of hand and it is improbable to believe anyone would write such a request
7055676 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
7055677 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda
7055678 richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
7055679 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
7055680 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
7055681 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
7055682 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community

7055687 to reveal myself to you as a very large white grandfather figure with flowing beard like gandalf would simply reinforce your religious stereotypes and this weekend is not about reinforcing your religious stereotypes

7055742 the point i was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity she doesnt but she is a typical white person who uh if she sees somebody on the street that she doesnt know theres a reaction thats been been bred into our experiences that dont go away and that sometimes come out in the wrong way and thats just the nature of race in our society
7055743 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7055744 unlike in 2004 we could not set up the systems earlier as the measures were still being finalised up until the end of july 2008
7055745 at any point in time when we make a decision to say this is the date there will always be people who fall outside that date that is unfortunate and i can understand their disappointment but we need to have a cut off date somewhere otherwise it will never end
7055746 so dont just look at what they dont get i think they should look at what they will get but more importantly look at the baby look at their own children and enjoy their children
7055747 yum yum yum can we have a piece of that
7055748 thats something id like to do in the future and that im aiming for
7055749 sergeys still the legend and im just a new newbie im going to try and do what i can to be as good as he was
7055750 but i feel that sooner or later its going to happen in steves career
7055751 ive been trying to get it so my technique is stable so i can get it for the next four years
7055752 its not just about this its about everything forward from here i felt like ive built a really good foundation hopefully some big things come off it
7055753 the way i used to jump was just aggression and sort of rawness it would be really sore on my body the next day after competitions now i feel like i could jump again things are way more in control way more technical i think thats a much smarter way of going about it
7055754 the big thing for me one of my big changes is i dont think about consequences of missing or clearing
7055755 i didnt think about the interviews id have to do if i missed and came fifth at the olympics
7055756 its something that in the past i had worried about i was just in the moment i was enjoying i was loving being in a dogfight with evgeny lukyanenko i think that was the difference i loved having third attempt clearances i loved it all being on the line
7055757 in the end it was good i was doing all the third attempt jumps because i was knocking all the nervous energy out
7055758 i started to jump technically well and thats what got me through in the end
7055759 i took a moment before jumping at 5 90 and i just sat back and realised i was doing something that every kid dreams of
7055760 evgeny was out of the competition if i clear that bar im an olympic gold medallist and i did think i was the kind of person that could stand up and take that sort of opportunity on to have done it is a dream come true
7055761 it looked like hes ruptured his biceps so hes not very good at the moment
7055762 its a pretty sombre dressing room in there at the moment the doctors pretty much know how to estimate the damage there off the bat when its as bad as it apparently is
7055763 i guess everything is subject to the scanning and all that so that they get the exact images to make a full decision but that certainly doesnt look good
7055764 it would depend on how bad it is but if it requires surgery its a six month injury
7055765 not many people get to go out on their own terms in this game
7055766 it will be very sad for him if he misses the big farewell hed like to go out with his boots on im sure
7055767 i thought he must have had a rest and come off early
7055768 but then i came in the sheds and found out the news he was pretty shattered
7055769 the nationwide poverty rate has stalled around 11 or 12 percent for years and thats for a family of four with income under the federally set line now 21 200 a year try living on that a reasonable minimum for food shelter and clothing needs would be closer to 30 000
7055770 poverty places a huge drag on the economic output and productivity of states and communities poor health substandard housing mental stress employment crises teenage pregnancy low literacy and added likelihood of arrest and imprisonment all appear to be part of a misery package that hits poor populations far more heavily than the rest of us
7055771 so whats to be done what should the 15 state commissions and how about the other 35 recommend
7055772 first and most obvious get more money into the pockets of the poor
7055773 if i should not be able to lead this country can take my place

7055802 im going to run it like i always run it
7055803 these systems were supposed to be tested and supposed to be certified against such problems
7055804 they get away with things like proprietary info and trade secrets that cover up problems like faulty programming
7055805 as of this moment i was not planning to go but my plans may have changed
7055806 its a tiny blue state and those comments are fair
7055807 but i dont think theyre fair if you take an objective view of the overall picture hes good with blue collar voters hes an irish catholic with strong family values hes strong on israel and will attract jewish voters hes strong with labor
7055808 by winning in 2012 in my home city of london thats the way ill do it
7055809 i must admit it would be hard to say no to a million pounds
7055810 obviously they will have to compensate me if they give me more money and a couple of sponsors amateur boxing is me
7055811 he might have run into me when my mouth was open
7055812 bits of the fight were all right there was not so much holding and scrapping
7055813 they love boxing here and they are a boxing country
7055814 it features tv auditions bitchy judges performance anxieties theyre all there
7055815 our athletes have to walk long distances from a very young age to go to school unlike those in developed countries so they just get used to it quite early
7055816 we are very good at long distance because of the hardships we face training at high altitudes has also helped
7055817 conditions are hard in ethiopia and our athletes are used to that and having to work hard
7055818 we focus on what we can do and we have a project of starting them from 800 metres and then go to long distance the events we have got most medals for in the past
7055819 most of it is just better planning kenyans and ethiopians work very hard at developing their talent and raising the level of their performance
7055820 we had expected to perform better so this calls for sober reflection on our part

7055835 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7055836 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7055837 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7055838 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7055839 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7055840 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7055841 in this stage you can assure that your finished layout is working cause you applied it in your own profile lol

7055866 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7055867 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie
7055868 a massive building expansion by milwaukee public schools has saddled the district with tens of millions of dollars worth of vacant or severely underused school additions

7055873 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7055874 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7055875 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries

7055885 a duck glides placidly gently over water but what you dont see is that it paddles like hell under water i am something like that
7055886 and at the policy level we partner with the department of environment and natural resources in studying rules on air soil and water quality
7055887 it was serendipity because at that time i was itching to get out of corporate life i was happy but it was no longer challenging so after the audit i counted two ships i came back and the japanese whom i met followed me here and we put up a company in april 1979
7055888 i would like all of us to be united in our efforts to compete globally while addressing our unique needs our thrust is to have more global filipino companies

7055900 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7055901 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7055902 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7055903 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7055904 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7055905 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7055906 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region
7055907 where youre in a denial you go back to help you front the post then you deny on the other side then youre back to help then a guy comes down the lane and you step in and take a charge and close out the intensity of it was unbelievable
7055908 and our guys saw it they just looked at it and said were going to get
7055909 weve entered gazan waters were flying the palestinian flag and we now believe that were going to reach the shores of gaza very soon i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks today is a huge victory of people over power
7055910 we thought we were almost going to have a freeway baby
7055911 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7055912 we always want to be on the top and i think starting on the pole here for the first time is very nice
7055913 the track here is not very easy especially the surface is a little bit slippery so to make a perfect lap is always very difficult i had a good lap so i think we have a good race for tomorrow
7055914 i think we noticed we had a good car through testing and then going into the first and second qualifying sessions it was just knocking it through
7055915 generally im very happy i think its a good starting position for us tomorrow and a great job done by the team
7055916 that was a real pretty dance that dance they just did
7055917 sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer
7055918 id think it would be real interesting hearing all the different sounds

7055923 i dont care if youre not equal to me for a while
7055924 i dont notice it any more its just a part of me
7055925 if there was just some way we could make a little hole in the bottom of the bag and just take out a few of them lead balls just a few
7055926 two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball i took out
7055927 if you could just take a few out when you came home from work
7055928 i mean you dont compete with anybody around here you just set around
7055929 then other peopled get away with it and pretty soon wed be right back to the dark ages again with everybody competing against everybody else you wouldnt like that would you
7055930 the minute people start cheating on laws what do you think happens to society
7055931 he tried thats the big thing he tried to do the best he could with what god gave him he should get a nice raise for trying so hard
7055932 has just escaped from jail where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government he is a genius and an athlete is under handicapped and should be regarded as extremely dangerous
7055933 do not i repeat do not try to reason with him

7055943 it may be that participants really had made up their minds and just didnt know it yet
7055944 or they may have been leaning in one direction unconsciously and that biased how they interpreted the information they got about the issue in subsequent days
7055945 in a debate between obama and mccain it may not be entirely clear who showed the better performance
7055946 but undecided voters with more favorable associations with mccain may see him as the one who did the better job
7055947 its this biased perception of events that then provide the basis of their future decisions
7055948 there is definitely a buzz surrounding the program that seems to be growing as we get closer to the season
7055949 our performance at the national championships last year the depth and quality of guys we return and this incredible group of newcomers has many anticipating a very special season for osu
7055950 ryan has definitely put his stamp on this program and i think the team has taken on the character of its leader he is tough tenacious and competitive
7055951 he pays attention to detail he is blue collar in his approach to training and isnt afraid to suffer when it comes time to race he sets his goals extremely high and then pours everything into acheiving them he makes our entire team better by making believers out of each of his teammates he has shown them again and again how to accomplish what most say you cannot this is ryans team and i cant think of a better guy to lead us as we strive to climb a couple of more steps on that podium
7055952 those guys are all veteran guys now and they understand how we train and how we run a race as a team
7055953 the have all trained hard with the philosophy that they train like the number one guy but they compete within the team strategy which may mean running as the fourth or fifth guy i have a lot of confidence in those three and they are a key to our season
7055954 german is a phenomenal talent and as cliche as it might sound truly the sky is the limit for him
7055955 he has some big dreams for the long term future of his career and some pretty lofty goals in the short term for both himself and the team he is still a very young athlete and we are going to take a very conservative deliberate approach to his training to give him all the time he needs to devolop at his own rate that being said if all goes well i have no doubt that he could have a major impact on our team finish as early as the ncaa championships in terre haute this november
7055956 this is by far the best team i have ever been associated with they are talented they are hungry and they have worked incredibly hard to climb into the ranks of the elite cross country programs
7055957 i am really excited for them and cant wait to see what they do when it comes time to race
7055958 im excited to bring my emmy award winning writing to the field of animation

7055966 as a matter of spirit rather than a matter of law
7055967 how can we evolve a true enlightened philosophy of justice
7055968 wisdom seeking the big picture the aim and purpose of justice
7055969 moderation love and compassion adapting change to where we are a way of life that we create from who we are and that evolves with us
7055970 exploring how were connected to all that is and how this sheds light on our nature
7055971 wholeness all things are interrelated connected which means every one has a value no one can be left out and every experience tells us something about the whole system
7055972 change all of creation is in a state of constant change which means change is our nature and justice must help us change both ourselves and societies
7055973 the seen and the unseen are two aspects of one reality and must be honored and kept in balance
7055974 all of this comes together in the spiritual law what blesses one blesses all
7055975 i felt good about the guys at bats and the way their approach was tonight
7055976 its a tough game the score doesnt really indicate how tough of a game it was
7055977 to hold them to four runs considering what i did the last two times wasnt too bad i could have been better could have been a little sharper at least i gave us a chance this time
7055978 when the umpire said safe there i got a little relief

7056018 read the bible as you would livy or tacitus for example in the book of joshua we are told the sun stood still for several hours were we to read that fact in livy or tacitus we should class it with their showers of blood speaking of their statues beasts etc but it is said that the writer of that book was inspired examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired the pretension is entitled to your inquiry because millions believe it on the other hand you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature
7056019 keep in your eye the opposite pretensions first of those who say he was begotten by god born of a virgin suspended and reversed the laws of nature at will and ascended bodily into heaven and second of those who say he was a man of illegitimate birth of a benevolent heart enthusiastic mind who set out without pretensions to divinity ended in believing them and was punished capitally for sedition by being gibbeted according to the roman law which punished the first commission of that offence by whipping and the second by exile or death in furea
7056020 the day will come when the mystical generation of jesus by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of minerva in the brain of jupiter
7056021 if we could believe that he jesus really countenanced the follies the falsehoods and the charlatanism which his biographers matthew mark luke and john father on him and admit the misconstructions interpolations and theorizations of the fathers of the early and the fanatics of the latter ages the conclusion would be irresistible by every sound mind that he was an impostor

7056031 a linebacker has to go side to side stop and accelerate
7056032 for him he needs a stable knee if he was a lineman it would be an easier choice but where he plays he cant afford not to have his knee be stable and have it slip on him
7056033 thats the thing he has to weigh risk versus benefit
7056034 because the other ligaments the secondary ones can get stretched and they are not strong enough to provide the stability its like with a house and you take out all the weight bearing walls the other walls might be strong enough to hold the house up then again they may not
7056035 if its not completely unstable the combination of a knee brace strengthening it and other ways to stabilize it might allow him to play
7056036 but if its not stable he needs to have it fixed

7056096 for as long as i can remember homosexuals have been explaining why gay people have no choice about their orientation and it finally dawned on me that their arguments explain why being anti gay is also not a choice but an innate predisposition beyond our power to restrain this led me to embrace my convictions and stop trying in vain to repress who i am since millions suffer from this same condition im hopeful that my epiphany will help others accept themselves and their convictions too
7056097 if we cant control whom we love thats because we cant control our strong passions but passions can be both for and against and just as gay love is a passion which is impossible to control i now know that my passionate anti gayness must also be impossible to control i might wish i could change but its hopeless my judgmental tendency draws me as irresistibly as their same sex affection
7056098 i used to think that restraint was the key differentiator between animals and men but then it was explained to me that sexual urges are such a deep element of real human nature that its wrong to suppress them this led me to realize that moral urges are an equally deep aspect of human identity and it must be unhealthy to try to suppress them too just as someone may feel a deep desire to have same gender sex i often suffer the seemingly irresistible urge to espouse my views on sexual ethics in fact my desire to express my beliefs is so deeply human that even the first amendment to our constitution explicitly protects it so it must be truly unhealthy to try repressing something as innate as opposition to homosexuality
7056099 who would choose to suffer discrimination fear alienation and family discord i used to worry that this argument would prevent disapproving of any behavior at all since it seems to entail the unusual conclusion that the more despised something is the less anyone can be blamed for it but then i realized that i have been ridiculed called intolerant and fired from an academic post for my beliefs on this subject in fact ive often thought how much easier my life in this culture would be if only i could lay down the burden of believing in traditional morals and embrace homosexuality since no rational person in the united states in 2008 would choose to be anti gay if he didnt have to be it must not be a choice
7056100 the realization that no one straight or gay ever consciously flips a switch to set their sexual preference led me to the recognition that i never chose to be anti gay its not like i went to bed one night thinking supportive thoughts about gayness and then woke up the next morning committed to opposing it its more accurate to say that one day i just sort of realized almost to my horror that i thought gay behavior was wrong i felt like i had been suppressing my innate moral voice because of social pressure before finally coming to terms with it on top of my parents both being pro gay and having lots of gay friends i had actually taken a seminar on gay theory from richard mohr one of the countys most prominent gay philosophers i would gladly have been homo endorsant if i could have been but all to no avail and i clearly cant un choose what i had never chosen in the first place

7056168 weve entered gazan waters were flying the palestinian flag and we now believe that were going to reach the shores of gaza very soon i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks today is a huge victory of people over power
7056169 es war heute ein sehr entt uschendes qualifying zumal wir das ganze wochenende schnell waren
7056170 mein erster run auf den harten reifen war gut aber wir haben einfach den falschen reifen f r meinen letzten angriff im ersten qualifying gew hlt
7056171 mit der weichen mischung hatte ich keinen grip wir waren damit einfach nicht konkurrenzf hig genug mein letzter angriff war etwas langsamer als mein erster run das sollte auf einer strecke die sich permanent verbessert eigentlich nicht so sein ich bin sehr entt uscht da wir unser auto verbessert haben heute haben wir daraus aber nicht das beste gemacht
7056172 es war f r uns heute ein unglaublich frustrierender tag
7056173 wir waren nicht in der lage im training heute morgen eine vern nftige balance f r das auto zu finden das hat unsere vorbereitungen f r das qualifying beeinflusst
7056174 heute nachmittag hatte ich besonders probleme mit dem heck welches st ndig quer kam das hat mich viel zeit gekostet ich konnte daher in der runde nicht angreifen es ist sehr entt uschend im ersten rennen hier von so weit hinten zu starten
7056175 unsere geschwindigkeit im freien training war echt und wir haben w hrend der pause und hier dieser woche definitiv ein paar verbesserungen am auto realisiert
7056176 heute hatte ich das gef hl dass wir ein auto in den top 10 h tten haben k nnen
7056177 rubens k mpfte den ganzen tag ber mit dem auto und wir schafften es nie wirklich diese probleme in den griff zu bekommen jenson hat das auto hingegen sehr gut zum arbeiten bewegt so wie wir dies auf seinem ersten versuch im qualifying sahen als er den h rteren reifen verwandte
7056178 er wechselte dann auf den weicheren reifen aber dieser funktionierte bei ihm berhaupt nicht und er konnte seine zuvor gefahrene zeit nicht egalisieren wenn das mittelfeld so eng beieinander liegt dann wirft dies einen aus dem kampf im zweiten qualifying teil
7056179 von unseren start positionen aus wird das rennen sicherlich eine herausforderung werden wenn das auto morgen gut funktioniert dann werden es die fahrer gegen die langsameren autos vor uns zu tun bekommen und wir denken dass das berholen schwierig werden wird
7056180 zwischenf lle im rennen sind hier jedoch wahrscheinlich es k nnte abseits der ideallinie schwierig sein so wie wir dies von anderen ferngesehen haben es gibt stellen an denen die autos schwierig zu bergen sind safety cars sind also wirklich m glich wir m ssen uns nun darauf konzentrieren unsere strategie so robust wie m glich zu gestalten um sicherzustellen dass wir gut platziert sind um aus allen m glichkeiten einen vorteil zu ziehen

7056460 toen het idee op tafel kwam hebben we elkaar meteen gevonden de samenwerking was uitstekend er is een prachtige rit uit de bus gerold
7056461 de solex is helemaal terug van weggeweest naast de roemruchte daltons uit tilligte die zich in deze regio mogen beroepen op de langste solextraditie zijn de afgelopen jaren clubs opgericht in beuningen de lutte weerselo en oldenzaal
7056462 er zijn nu al veel aanvragen van clubs uit het land noordoost twente is een fantastisch gebied voor de solex maar dit jaar beperken we het tot de verenigingen uit de eigen regio ruim honderd solexrijders vinden wij voor een eerste keer genoeg
7056463 when i go around and i talk to people there is frustration and there is anger and there is bitterness and whats worse is when people are expressing their anger then politicians try to say what are you angry about this just happened i want to make a point here today
7056464 i was in san francisco talking to a group at a fundraiser and somebody asked howre you going to get votes in pennsylvania
7056465 well look theyre frustrated and for good reason because for the last 25 years theyve seen jobs shipped overseas theyve seen their economies collapse they have lost their jobs they have lost their pensions they have lost their healthcare
7056466 and for 25 30 years democrats and republicans have come before them and said were going to make your community better
7056467 out of touch out of touch i mean john mccain it took him three tries to finally figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was a problem and to come up with a plan for it and hes saying im out of touch senator clinton voted for a credit card sponsored bankruptcy bill that made it harder for people to get out of debt after taking money from the financial services companies and she says im out of touch no im in touch i know exactly whats going on i know whats going on in pennsylvania i know whats going on in indiana i know whats going on in illinois people are fed up theyre angry and theyre frustrated and theyre bitter and they want to see a change in washington and thats why im running for president of the united states of america
7056468 bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are
7056469 is the israel palestine conflict still the key to peace in the whole region is the linkage policy right
7056470 i dont think its about a linkage policy but a linkage fact without doubt the path to peace in the middle east goes through jerusalem
7056471 the israeli palestinian conflict is the single most combustible and galvanizing issue in the arab world
7056472 the first step in the re creation of the european family
7056473 the problems of the middle east are conflated and certainly the israeli palestinian conflict and iraq are interactive thats absolutely a fundamental truth
7056474 this could be a golden opportunity to begin to change the face of the arab world just as what we did in germany changed the face of central and eastern europe here we have got a golden chance

7056476 i saw a movie last night that i cannot talk about
7056477 the stars absolutely trek in this film it is fantastic anybody who was worried doesnt need to be worried about this film i cannot talk about it was in very capable hands the director did a phenomenal job the director and his crew top notch cast and the guy that plays the lead is an instant star that dude is going to be so famous he is so wonderful he picked up a role that i would say is pretty challenging for someone to step into the shoes of because it is a role that has been played before many times by the same guy
7056478 i was afraid i would be afraid but i was not afraid

7056502 lady im not going to newark its time for a shift change
7056503 you can build an effective soundbite like you build a lego building
7056504 we gonna fight we gon fight fight for our rights
7056505 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix
7056506 its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
7056507 we have explained our point of view about the issue and also listened to what different groups of people in meghalaya have to say about uranium mining
7056508 the separatist lied to the whole country to the whole world saying that hindu colonisation would come up in the valley nobody in the valley not even the state government or the central government countered that propaganda the separatists lied to the world saying there is an economic blockade
7056509 we were the only ones who countered the argument and today we are the ones who are saying that the land transfer is pursuant to a law enacted by the state legislature pursuant to a direction of the high court so why should it not be implemented
7056510 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7056511 we were still very low very close to the ground
7056512 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7056513 i thought that if there was something wrong the right thing to do is switch planes i told my husband they should put us on another plane

7056517 were not throwing mallets around in the water its a sport of strength and finesse
7056518 the running joke with our team was everybody who comes to our games was either our parents or our siblings or just our friends from school
7056519 weve got three time olympians who are the most decorated athletes in womens water polo over the last eight years internationally
7056520 but this is probably going to be the lowest paying job theyll ever have in their lifetime
7056521 it usually becomes a defensive oriented game less goals scored less action happens it just becomes a stagnant game it just grinds to a halt its just not enjoyable to the eye
7056522 theres more action theres more emphasis on defensive positioning instead of defensive wrestling and with more action its more entertaining to watch
7056523 as you bring your feet around its pushing against the water
7056524 some people can get out to where you can see the bottom of their suits
7056525 big companies will want to back us and see that were these great athletic and beautiful women who have something to offer for the community and for little girls everywhere

7056532 two speed boats chased and opened fire at the japanese operated ship a suspected mother ship was in the vicinity but the japanese ship managed to escape after the captain increased speed and took evasive maneuvers
7056533 it appears pirates are still trying to hijack ships in the location
7056534 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7056535 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7056536 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7056537 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years

7056545 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7056546 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7056547 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7056548 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices

7056562 weve struggled for speed for most of the weekend its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7056563 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7056564 a very disappointing qualifying we seem to have struggled for pace here all weekend despite having been very fast in the last sector and its frustrating for the drivers to finish in 14th and 17th an incident filled race is the only way were likely to achieve any points this weekend so well wait and see congratulations to toro rosso who got both their cars into the top ten for the first time

7056574 i heard you briefly on the radio this lunchtime dont know what the programme was my husband was listening to music as we drove across town and i tuned in to the talky bit what i did hear and wanted to applaud loudly was your bit about foot care for the elderly
7056575 im a physiotherapist have worked in palliative care since 1991 many elderly people cannot reach down to their feet cannot cut their own toenails and carers and district nurses if they are lucky enough to have one arent allowed to apply cream or dry between their toes so in growing toe nails and fungal infections are a huge problem
7056576 in our area the waiting lists for podiatry are huge and for many the effort of getting to an outpatient clinic is prohibitive
7056577 feet become increasingly swollen due to immobility itchy due to dry stretched and cracking flaking skin painful bursting feeling and pressure from footwear shoes become unwearable or dangerously boat like causing damage to the feet or leading to falls and legs are heavy try walking about with a litre bottle of water strapped to your lower leg and many of our patients are carrying up to 6 litres of extra fluid in each leg
7056578 so much of the above could be avoided by care and attention at an early stage by the education of carers in sheltered accommodation about the need to look after the largest organ of the body the skin and encouragement and help with basic foot care and mobility issues for our elderly citizens many of whom live alone and struggle on

7056592 im glad countdown is over that was a long year of dc nation for me
7056593 when i first started at dc one of the franchises i really wanted to invigorate was teen titans as the legend goes paul levitz my boss didnt believe teen titans were going to work that well because we had done so many reboots before that and they all seemed to trip over it
7056594 when titans came out by geoff johns and mike mckone and was a big hit paul came into my office threw a copy of teen titans onto my desk and goes too bad we cant do the same thing with legion
7056595 we know theres an audience out there and we keep on trying to get it right
7056596 one clear interpretation of the legion by the time were through
7056597 an incredibly strong character when he appears with the teams hes a great counterpoint to a lot of other characters in justice league and other places
7056598 my problem with us is that we reboot the characters too much
7056599 what happens is that if a character doesnt work we go we got a brand new direction to put him in
7056600 our biggest mistake is that we dont continue and build on what we should be doing is let it sit for a while and then come back with a good strong story with whats going on
7056601 is that were locking our characters down were going with a good interpretation and were staying with it thats why you dont see aquaman right now because we want it to be clear what it is who he is and what hes all about
7056602 dont make me bust you here dan in front of this room full of people
7056603 there have been pockets of time where ive tried to allow for it to happen but because of one various mis communication or another it hasnt come together its important that when it does happen it happens correctly and it happens in a way that will appeal to the most people possible so both of you guys are out

7056607 now is the time for this character flash is a csi scientist its a whole new avenue for flash stories and these are stories geoff and i want to tell and you have to give us the room now this isnt a reboot we are going to make this part of one long continuous story just like with hal jordan everything that was done even before us was part of a much larger picture were going to do the same thing with barry allen and the entire flash legacy

7056655 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7056656 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7056657 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7056658 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7056659 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7056660 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7056661 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7056662 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7056663 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
7056664 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7056665 if you trust every web site but not a government
7056666 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7056667 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7056668 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7056669 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7056670 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7056671 sebastian wie gl cklich bist du mit diesem sechsten platz
7056672 sehr gl cklich f r das ganze team ist es sehr gut gelaufen beide autos im dritten qualifying als ich reinkam und mein name ganz oben stand dachte ich da hat einer den monitor umgedreht das war dann nicht der fall
7056673 das hatten wir nicht erwartet aber das auto hat sich sehr gut angef hlt da hat man vertrauen ich mag die strecke sehr heute hat alles gestimmt dann kann man so tage haben es ist das ziel f r die zukunft das zu wiederholen im letzten qualifying h tte ich schneller sein m ssen aber leider habe ich beim anbremsen auf kurve zw lf das heck verloren das hat doch ziemlich viel zeit gekostet der abstand zu position f nf war doch sehr gro aber f r einen platz h tte es vielleicht gereicht
7056674 du hast ein grinsen im gesicht wie lange wird das noch anhalten
7056675 zumindest bis heute abend und die ganze nacht ich hoffe dass wir morgen auch einen grund haben freude auszustrahlen es hat alles gestimmt und es hat unheimlich spa gemacht heute auch wenn ich mir nach der starken pace in q2 vielleicht ein bisschen mehr ausgerechnet h tte ich habe das auto nicht berfahren aber ich habe es in kurve zw lf vielleicht ein bisschen zu sehr versucht dann habe ich das heck verloren
7056676 wir sind gut vorbereitet das ganze wochenende hat gut funktioniert auch gestern war ein guter tag f r uns und die nderungen ber nacht haben alle gut angeschlagen jetzt freuen wir uns auf morgen heute d rfen wir uns freuen aber morgen m ssen wir wieder die f e auf dem boden lassen denn es wird schwer genug die position zu behaupten wenn morgen ein paar punkte rausspringen w re das schon ein gro er erfolg
7056677 wie willst du es schaffen das auto morgen nicht zu berfahren
7056678 ich denke das werden wir schon irgendwie deichseln da mache ich mir weniger gedanken wir wissen genau wie wir morgen unterwegs sind der speed ist gut beachtlich es gibt eine realistische chance in die punkte zu fahren in der startaufstellung stehen wir schon drin aber da sind noch viele runden zu fahren am ende wird zusammengez hlt
7056679 fr her gab es den schumacher faktor gibt es jetzt schon so etwas wie den vettel faktor
7056680 es gibt genug experten da drau en die sollen das beurteilen ich habe spa an der sache ich bin jetzt drei wochen nicht gefahren und habe mich wohl mit am meisten gefreut wieder zu fahren ich bin hei und wenn das auto so gut funktioniert dann macht es nat rlich umso mehr spa die strecke ist neu eine tolle herausforderung die hat es wirklich in sich

7056683 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
7056684 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
7056685 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
7056686 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
7056687 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
7056688 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no

7056704 i told the people i met with that whoever had capital to invest of any kind 100 000 50 000 10 000 could return to itabirinha and create his or her own business
7056705 we had a market for any business they wanted to create and we are ready to help them no matter how much they wanted to invest i made it clear itabirinha is waiting for them with open arms
7056706 the stability in the united states crashed and the dollar has lost so much value
7056707 so the money i was making there did not translate into that much in brazilian currency it just was not worth it to stay in the us
7056708 he said the town was developing but that it needed more investment and he would help us if we came back so i did and i am happy with that decision because i have my family here and also now my business
7056709 many of these people returning left brazil five years ago or more without any global perspective
7056710 and now they are coming back here as entrepreneurs to create businesses and opportunities and jobs for others that have not left itabirinha the economy of the city improves any way you look at it
7056711 as we turn the page to begin a new chapter of life we find it titled forever
7056712 we came from a situation where we produced 5 000 kg of corn by hectare while today it is 10 to 12 000 kg per hectare of corn
7056713 we have more chinese people eating we have more indians eating we have more africans eating and we have a lot more brazilians eating
7056714 all this which is treated by the press as if it were a crisis and is sold to the world as if it were a crisis
7056715 without any arrogance or self importance we brazilians need to confront what for others is a crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to truly transform ourselves into the granary of the world as many people have long predicted
7056716 without any doubt there is potential to produce if the government doesnt get in the way
7056717 we are not even going to say help if they dont get in the way a lot year by year the producer is generally increasing production
7056718 if you talk about central brazil there are still a lot of areas to be exploited so i dont have much doubt
7056719 what we have seen in the last 10 years is a quiet revolution happening in our country mostly in agribusiness production
7056720 we came from being an irrelevant international market participant to be one of the worlds major food and biofuel suppliers today
7056721 so if you look at what happened to our agriculture in terms of beef exports poultry exports again we were irrelevant and now we have the position of largest exporter in the world in major food crops
7056722 the impact will start to emerge with more intensity within 20 to 30 years and until then we should be preparing for this
7056723 the perspective for the moment for future harvests is highly productive so brazil has the potential to continue growing around 5 to 6 a year in terms of increasing harvests we are going to effectively maintain this rhythm in the coming years without any problem
7056724 we are not against expanding the brazilian capacity for producing food and helping brazil to develop this country
7056725 you can increase the food capacity through technology through better practices through occupying areas that are already degraded to investing in better crops
7056726 but you can not increase your productivity at the expense of the environment because the global market doesnt accept this price any more
7056727 if we have the right investments coming on for logistics for infrastructure and for technology and land development the country can multiply by two and a half three times the actual production in the next 10 years
7056728 of course we have increases that could come from europe from the usa from canada from argentina
7056729 but where you see the best conditions in order to give the world society the best rate of return in terms of investment is in brazil
7056730 if you talk about the next five years we are now producing 130 million tonnes of grains
7056731 we are now producing seven million hectares of sugar cane this can go to 20 million hectares helping to supply ethanol to the world we are only exporting 400m of fruits we can go to 3bn of fruits
7056732 next up is africa i think for africa this could be a redemption in terms of inclusion of people in production systems and making africa produce food and biofuels for the world
7056733 world demand for food today is one billion tonnes and brazil produces 150 million tonnes
7056734 brazil produces 150 million tonnes and the plan launched by the government for more food will produce six million more which is going to leave one million for export how is brazil going to be the granary of food production
7056735 of or referring to a political party in the usa
7056736 it looks like a democracy but its actually a republic
7056737 i dont know about what the people did no matter how bad it was so i cant be held responsible for it even tho they did it under my command

7056742 the state will award the dspn to penangs first olympic silver medallist bukit mertajam home grown talent lee chong wei
7056743 even though malaysians were disappointed that he failed to win the gold medal we are proud at his singular achievement which has brought joy to both state and country
7056744 the state government hopes that this recognition will spur him on to break more records and achieve greater success to win greater glory for both penang and malaysia
7056745 i thought that maybe if i win the gold medal i might be given datukship but no i never expected it for the silver and was very surprised
7056746 my thanks to the penang state for fully supporting me
7056747 indonesias view for southeast asian nations and skills for diplomat training
7056748 we count all of the chemicals fertilizers and fuels we also count the co2 released from our process that includes the direct co2 from the fermentation part and the energy part
7056749 we tried to bean count so we can understand which part is the major co2 producer
7056750 we looked at all of the places we were emitting greenhouse gases
7056751 we found that the biggest contributor is the fermentation process and the other big contributor is electricity so we developed a new process technology not only for environmental reasons but for economic reasons that gave significant reductions in greenhouse gases

7056754 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
7056755 we want to act to protect our brand reputation in the same way as any corporation would want to if people were posting or writing false accusations
7056756 this isnt about a debate on freedom of speech its simply helping us to identify the person who posted it
7056757 typically its the undecided voter that gives politicians a hard time its the undecided voters that you need to get
7056758 this study shows that by using these measures there is some potential for improving the prediction of election outcomes
7056759 the inspiration for this study came from the development of a particular class of measures that enables us to assess these automatic mental associations
7056760 over the past couple of years a lot of research has shown that these measures are able to predict behaviors that psychologists have had a hard time predicting with standard methodology or self report
7056761 this type of measure in the domain of prejudice and stereotyping has found that in north america there is a large proportion of individuals with relatively negative views of african americans even people who hold very strong egalitarian opinions or beliefs sometimes show negative associations
7056762 this can influence their voting behavior particularly for undecided voters in a way that they may not be aware of
7056763 we know that there is still a strong prevalence of automatic negative associations regarding african americans and this may have distorted peoples perception of the political process public debates etc
7056764 theyve made up their mind who theyre going to vote for even though theyre undecided when the polls are taken this could happen again in the u s it may be the case that the big advance that obama has at this point may completely shift in the election
7056765 i have full confidence that the meeting of the cambodian thai joint border commission jbc in early october 2008 followed by the next meeting of the two foreign ministers will bring about a peaceful settlement to the border issues not only in preah vihear temple area but also the entire border region between cambodia and thailand
7056766 i sincerely hope that the second meeting between the head of the cambodian contemporary coordinating task force and the head of the thai regional border committee on aug 29 2008 as agreed during the second foreign ministers meeting in hua hin province of thailand on aug 18 19 will result in removal of all the remaining troops at the areas around the preah vihear temple and cessation of all military build up in other border areas
7056767 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly

7056771 they have refused to return my driving license and the other documents claiming that when they stopped me somebody jumped out from the car and ran away into the nearby bush they claimed it was a criminal who ran they have also charged me among others with trying to escape control by not stopping where they showed me to
7056772 in fact they are asking me to pay 5000 fcfa for all the charges if i must be free

7056822 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7056823 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7056824 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7056825 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7056830 to fill their seats and bring in those qualified students private colleges and universities in particular are more willing to sweeten the pot a little this year
7056831 ive seen two or three cases this year where students ended up getting a better offer because they notified their school that they were admitted off a wait list from a better university
7056832 the lower tier school then notified them that they had found more money in their budget for financial aid
7056833 they called to tell me that if i knew any qualified students who wanted to attend they would give them an automatic 10 000 to 12 000 scholarship
7056834 ive been doing this for 26 years and though colleges will always deny that they do this it happens all the time
7056835 youre never going to get a lesser offer by asking for additional money
7056836 just ask if you are a good academic student and they know you have a better offer from a university they compete with they may come up with more money

7056879 mr obamas selection ended a two month search that was conducted almost entirely in secret it reflected a critical strategic choice by mr obama to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about gaps in his r sum rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce mr obamas message of change
7056880 on foreign policy and national security an area where john mccain regularly assails obamas lack of experience democrats offer few more seasoned practitioners than biden
7056881 on the democratic side it was a collective phew as the days got nearer for the pick it was hard to find a democrat even savvy clintonites who werent hoping it would be biden only the most strident hillary supporters appear to be upset this morning on the gop side the sound you heard was disappointed silence of everyone on the short list the candidate many republicans least wanted to see obama pick was biden
7056882 balanced against all of those unmatched qualifications is one quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things over the next few days and likely weeks some of bidens ungreatest hits of gab will be recycled by the media and republicans aiming to take the luster off obamas choice of running mate
7056883 obama biden works on several fronts a longtime sentimental favorite among the democratic faithful delaware sen joe biden provides a comfort zone for labor leaders catholics he is one and national security voters although bidens poor fundraising skills doomed his presidential campaigns he performs extremely well in debates and demonstrated considerable skill at shifting from the arcane language of the senate chamber to the street language of the campaign trail
7056884 time will tell if barack obama made the right choice in picking joe biden but if you look at it on paper it makes a whole lot of sense
7056885 obama biden will be a formidable ticket and a risky ticket and not a comfort zone choice for obama
7056886 conservatives will blast bidens record just as surely as liberals will or should celebrate it but one of the virtues of having biden as the vice presidential nominee is that he wont take those kinds of attacks lightly hell fight back hell remind people rightly that being a liberal democrat means raising the minimum wage making sure everybody has affordable health care providing strong public schools and protecting human rights then hell ask why conservative republicans dont want the same things thats exactly the kind of political debate this country needs by picking biden as a running mate obama has signaled that he welcomes this argument and intends finally to win it

7056893 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7056894 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7056895 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7056896 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7056906 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7056907 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7056908 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7056909 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

7056912 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7056913 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7056914 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7056915 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7056916 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7056937 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

7056939 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7056940 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7056941 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7056942 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7056943 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7056944 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7056945 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7056948 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7056949 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7056950 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7056951 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7056952 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7056953 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7056954 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7056955 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7056957 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7056958 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7056959 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7056960 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7056962 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7056963 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7056964 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7056965 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7056966 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7056967 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7056968 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7056969 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7056970 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7056971 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7056972 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7056973 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7056974 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7056975 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7056976 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7056977 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7056978 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7056979 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7056980 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7056981 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7056982 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7057046 itu benar kadang kadang terjadi tapi ini tergantung fraksi partainya kalau saya sudah didiskusikan kepada pimpinan fraksi dan ditentukan apabila ada uang itu kita terima saja tetapi langsung dikembalikan kepada kpk saya tidak tahu bagaimana dengan yang lain apakah terima atau dikembalikan
7057047 sekali lagi tidak terkait saya tidak masuk persoalan perhutanan tetapi pangan
7057048 semua anggota fpks di komisi iv sudah mengembalikan uang itu
7057049 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
7057050 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find

7057058 this time we will vote there is no doubt we have to assert our rights
7057059 but not voting has caused more suffering as we are dying for basic needs we want to change this situation everybody will vote this time
7057060 these days it is difficult to survive everything is so expensive the seeds the fertilisers i have 19 children to feed the situation got difficult because we did not vote last time but this time we will express our rights
7057061 last year i could hardly keep my shop open for two hours

7057067 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

7057072 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts said abdifatah ajos sanura a director at the shamo hotel where the pair stayed

7057078 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7057079 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7057080 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7057081 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7057082 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7057083 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7057084 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7057085 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7057086 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7057087 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7057088 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7057089 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7057090 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7057091 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7057092 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7057093 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7057094 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7057095 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7057096 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7057097 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7057098 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7057099 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7057100 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7057101 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7057102 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7057103 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7057104 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7057105 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7057106 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7057107 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7057108 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7057109 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7057110 this is a very very difficult time a time of great anxiety for the people who work at longbridge and for their families
7057111 we will continue to do absolutely everything we can to keep car production and as many jobs as possible
7057112 it is possible still that there may be the opportunity of doing something with the chinese company although not the original prospect that was there a few weeks ago
7057113 willingness to provide whatever assistance we can as saic considers what to do next
7057114 we are on the side of the working people at longbridge throughout mg rover people in supply industries here in birmingham across the black country and right across the midlands
7057115 we know the difficulties we know the worries that people have at this time and what we will do is fight as hard as we can for manufacturing for skilled jobs for the car industry and car jobs generally in this area
7057116 i dont want to go giving people false hopes we have an industry in crisis in our country
7057117 what the workers need is security for their jobs not political point scoring
7057118 when you keep on raising the cost to business of regulation you keep on raising tax it inevitably has a consequence on our ability to compete in a global economy
7057119 by the time the government offered the bridging loan it was already too late for rover its workers and its suppliers
7057120 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7057121 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7057122 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7057123 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7057124 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7057125 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7057126 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7057127 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7057128 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7057129 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7057130 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7057131 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7057132 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7057133 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7057134 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7057135 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7057136 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7057137 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7057138 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7057139 because of the hard effort of the womens and mens teams these past few days you can see only one coloured national flag rising up to the roof of the gymnasium that is the miracle we have created
7057140 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7057141 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7057142 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7057143 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7057144 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7057145 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7057146 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7057147 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7057148 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7057149 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7057150 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7057151 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7057152 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7057153 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7057154 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7057155 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7057156 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7057157 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7057158 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7057159 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7057160 we captured excellent video of the two idiots who practically posed for the cameras as they were leaving
7057161 we wont let these terrorists get the upper hand please continue to patronize nomad and other neighborhood businesses at night we want to support our community by keeping the place open at night and getting more neighbors and more eyes out on the streets in the evenings
7057162 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7057163 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7057164 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7057165 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7057166 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7057167 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7057174 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7057175 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7057176 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7057177 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7057178 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7057179 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7057180 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7057181 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7057182 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet

7057190 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7057191 i have read and agree to the terms of service
7057192 i have all these great ideas but i dont know where to go or what to do with them
7057193 we just watched felipes qualifying lap and as he said it was sector one in which he destroyed everyone
7057194 they are going to be hard to beat tomorrow but we will push as hard as possible to do so
7057195 we noticed we had a good car through practice and then going into q1 and q2 it was about getting through and it wasnt too much of a problem the car felt great
7057196 i stayed on the option tyre for both of my q3 laps and the first one wasnt a great lap i probably lost a second compared to my later timed lap
7057197 but i think the last lap was pretty good i was quite happy with that
7057198 there is always a little bit of time you lose somewhere but generally i was very happy and it is a good starting position for us tomorrow
7057199 i think i was already down a tenth or two tenths after the first corner
7057200 it was okay through turn two and three and then four and five it didnt seem to be as strong as i liked so that is probably where the time went

7057203 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top 10 so this is a good result for us
7057204 wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying
7057205 we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today
7057206 we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible
7057207 today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7057208 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield
7057209 it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level
7057210 ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7057211 its good to have at least one car in q3 which weve missed for quite some races
7057212 unfortunately kazuki just missed out on his first q3 by the smallest of margins
7057213 the important thing now is to prepare for the race and make sure were happy with our strategy
7057214 we were quite optimistic of being in q3 and to be honest quite confident
7057215 but you never know the timesheet is so tight that one or two tenths can put you in or out of q3 and this time we were one of the guys to go out
7057216 we didnt do well enough for tomorrow we need to improve and for the next race as well
7057217 of course you can always improve in some corners but it is difficult to know when you are in the car
7057218 anyway i used four new sets of tyres between q1 and q2 and the best and the worst laps were only two or three tenths apart
7057219 so the time is there its not that we were missing one big opportunity
7057220 we have struggled for grip for most of the weekend to be honest
7057221 both sebastians vettel and bourdais are obviously are driving very well here and they have set up their car a little differently not massively
7057222 we know that they have a stronger engine that is clear but probably not by the tune that they are ahead of us
7057223 the engine is probably worth four tenths or so but the rest is we need to do a better job
7057224 they have done a better job this weekend than us in particular and also a lot of other teams
7057225 you see where renault are as well and its a difficult day for them
7057226 we havent had the pace we had a few races ago so it is getting frustrating
7057227 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying
7057228 on my last run i ran wide in turn five and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through
7057229 that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7057230 we seem to have struggled for pace here all weekend despite having been very fast in the last sector and its frustrating for the drivers to finish in 14th and 17th
7057231 an incident filled race is the only way were likely to achieve any points this weekend so well wait and see
7057232 congratulations to toro rosso who got both their cars into the top 10 for the first time
7057233 it has been a very good qualifying for myself and the team
7057234 after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not as bad as it was before but we are still missing a bit of time to ferrari and mclaren
7057235 only the weather was playing a bit of a role so we were anticipating every stint that we were on especially the first one in quali 3 to make sure that we would be fine

7057246 over time its hoped frogs in captivity may build up a resilience to it and then be released back into the wild

7057307 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7057308 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7057309 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7057310 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7057311 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7057312 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7057313 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7057314 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7057315 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7057330 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7057331 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7057332 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7057333 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7057334 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7057335 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7057336 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7057337 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

7057339 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7057340 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7057341 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7057342 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7057343 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7057344 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7057345 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7057346 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7057347 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7057348 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7057349 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7057350 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7057351 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7057352 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7057353 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7057354 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7057355 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7057356 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7057357 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7057358 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7057359 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7057360 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7057361 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7057362 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7057363 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7057364 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7057365 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7057366 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7057367 im delighted that my old friend joe biden will bring tremendous experience as vice president
7057368 generously helped me get elected by anchoring a fundraiser for me
7057369 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election

7057383 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7057384 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7057385 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7057386 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7057387 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7057388 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7057389 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7057390 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7057391 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7057392 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7057393 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7057394 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7057395 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7057396 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7057397 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7057398 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7057399 this is a planning took where all things are going
7057400 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7057401 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7057402 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7057403 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7057404 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7057405 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7057406 look i guarantee therell be tough times i guarantee that at some time one or both of us is gonna want to get out of this thing but i also guarantee that if i dont ask you to be mine ill regret it for the rest of my life because i know in my heart youre the only one for me
7057407 i would rather have had one breath of her hair one kiss from her mouth one touch of her hand than eternity without it

7057410 when the planes hit the twin towers as far as i know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge they were all messages of love
7057411 i hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair
7057412 i love that you get cold when it is 71 degrees out
7057413 i love you you complete me shut up just shut up you had me at hello

7057431 ik leef in een wereld met andere mensen van alle soorten rassen godsdiensten volkeren talen doorbreek de ban van een ingestelde orde dat alleen deze godsdienst goed is of die kerk is juist of dit ras is beter doorbreek dat krijg een gevoel voor de mensheid voor iedereen en dan blijf je wat je bent je mag jood blijven je mag iets anders blijven zoals iemand die kleur haren en die kleur ogen heeft maar de mens is een mens naar het beeld van god gemaakt en krijg een gevoel van verantwoordelijkheid voor de mens berhaupt waar die ook is een ding zou ik positief kunnen zeggen dat is dit dat misschien in dit tijdperk de barri res weggebroken worden dat men niet meer dat heeft wat ik dan nog voel als een soort nacht in de wereld waar men nog volkeren barri res heeft en rassen en godsdiensten en kerken en sekten maar dat dit doorbroken wordt een soort universaliteit komt over de mens en wat hij is is punt 1 hij is een mens of hij nou katholiek is of jood of wat hij is een mens zo heb je ook joden en arabieren het zijn mensen aan beide kanten dat moet men ook beginnen te beseffen dat je zegt ik moet hier kiezen ik durf het er is een grote waarheid en er is een gemaakte en de mens weet drommels goed bij zichzelf waar de echte waarheid is en wat er gemaakt is hij wil het feitelijk niet weten maar hij moet wel eens wakker geschud worden dat doen de omstandigheden wel en dan moet hij weten hoe hij kiest die verantwoordelijkheid moet hij beseffen en zich dit realiseren ik l f in een wereld niet ons vaderland gaat goed deze vlag wappert fier dat is ook een deel van het spel ik heb niets tegen een vlag maar dat symbool mag niet iets dwaas gaan worden het mag je herinneren aan je omgeving en die naaste omgeving dat zeer zeker maar je moet niet je naaste omgeving meer lief hebben dan je verdere omgeving je moet de mens lief hebben je mag jezelf natuurlijk niet negeren stel je voor dat zou toch een dwaas leven zijn je bent het centrum toch van de wereld ieder mens voor zichzelf is weer het middelpunt en hij moet natuurlijk aan zichzelf denken maar niet in de zin van ik moet carri re maken of ik moet een auto kopen of ik moet dit kopen of een reis maken maar ik moet in terreinen komen met mijn benen ik moet wakker zijn dat is n van de dingen die ik verlang w s wakker en als je gewekt bent dan zul je wel eens met veel dingen ernstig in aanraking kunnen komen

7057456 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
7057457 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
7057458 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
7057459 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
7057460 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
7057461 it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
7057462 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food
7057463 if youre one of the tens of thousands of sag members who dont work enough or earn enough as an actor youre in danger of losing one of your fundamental rights as a union member
7057464 theyve proudly and publicly touted their list of supporters including the names of very high profile actor producers they and their supporters have signed a petition that would end democracy in the screen actors guild and create a class system between the haves and the have nots
7057465 the doctors told me the bad news the sam we loved was gone they were keeping a fragile shell of her alive
7057466 it was the hardest most heartbreaking decision ive ever had to make to tell the doctors to let my beautiful sam slip away into her long sleep i wept like a child
7057467 whats the point of having girls if we cant f them
7057468 was not a tax resident of any country and therefore the payment was free of tax
7057469 he has chosen the perfect running mate frank barbaro a hillary rodham clinton delegate and chairman of the orange county democratic party said in response to an e mail the register sent to the delegates soon after word about biden got out late last night
7057470 biden can now go on the offensive against republican sen
7057471 after obama decided not to pick hillary clinton who would have helped him a lot in getting elected
7057472 what i dont agree on in that biden does not represent change but neither does hillary biden therefore biden is a balance for the obama ticket i am not sure if biden will be able to bring the votes needed to help obama like hillary would of
7057473 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7057474 i was for biden until he dropped out said linnette garber a clinton delegate from the 48th district
7057475 im very excited about that pick i think hillary delegates will join me in my excitement
7057476 obamas greatest vulnerability is his lack of experience especially foreign policy experience
7057477 biden is the guy sent from central casting to fill that bill
7057478 like reagan obama has strengthened the ticket by selecting biden who could govern from day one and whose foreign policy experience far surpasses john mccains hanna said
7057479 this choice for a vp is a good indicator of the kind of talent and quality leaders that senator obama will appoint to serve in roles and as advisors in his administration hopkins parham said
7057480 look its a great day for the health of our community
7057481 there may be some problems along the way but there always are when you have an undertaking of this magnitude
7057482 unfortunately the situation were in is that we dont make enough money to make payments on these new trucks even with the subsidies
7057483 the economys bad theres not enough work and now theyre asking us to take on debt no way
7057484 information is only useful as long as you can access it
7057485 what are the seniors the disabled people at the poverty level the young mothers going to do
7057486 somebody put a book in my hand a librarian at the dana branch
7057487 it was an anne mccaffrey fantasy and after that i was hooked
7057488 there i was minding my own business like i always do sitting at the reference desk at dana library and i got the call
7057489 in the same week she got her promotion she got her papers to report to duty
7057490 we were obviously devastated very unhappy that had happened we miss her a lot and though she would be a tremendous branch librarian we were very very sorry she had to leave for duty but duty calls we are very eager to have her come back
7057491 our ultimate mission is to work ourselves out of a job
7057492 it relates to library science in that i have to track vast amounts of information and get it out into the field in a timely matter to those who need it
7057493 our primary task is to help people help themselves which is what librarians do every day we make make the resources available to those who need them
7057494 i thought her letter was not only heartfelt but so right on
7057495 she sees the results of people not having access to reading and to literacy that is a crucial part of an informed democratic society that people have access to information
7057496 she is just multitalented energetic and brings such an enthusiasm to everything she does from her work to the people she deals with
7057497 ze zijn zeer geraffineerd en leggen klanten meteen een strop om
7057498 maar bedrijven hebben het contract gelezen je weet toch waarvoor je tekent
7057499 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on http www barackobama com spread the word
7057500 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7057501 we have got to take people through these difficult economic times we have done it before and we will do it again
7057502 you cant expect people to be cheering in the streets if you have oil prices rising and food prices rising
7057503 i am totally focused on only one thing and that is taking this country through these difficult economic circumstances
7057504 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
7057505 senator biden is a tremendous leader and a great complement to senator obama and his candidacy
7057506 he has worked as a committed public servant has a proven track record and understands the complex challenges facing our nation
7057507 he was too untested on foreign policy issues and too inexperienced and green to fight the terrorism battle and to be hard nosed enough on national security
7057508 we have had a president for nearly eight years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes every day all day
7057509 the corporate media typically forgive bush for this and dont even often bring it up why is it that it is an issue for biden but not for bush
7057510 joe biden is vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom
7057511 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7057512 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7057513 biden brings experience feistiness and boatloads of foreign policy seasoning that obama sorely lacks and biden knows more about sensible foreign policy than mccain tom ridge tim pawlenty or mitt romney will ever know themselves
7057514 picking biden also sends a stark signal that the obama campaign is worried that the presidential nominee is in danger of flunking the commander in chief test
7057515 it is not looking as good it was for obama
7057516 at this point we still expect him to win but it could be a much tighter race

7057534 the project aims to help reduce poverty by supporting sustainable fiscal management and good governance
7057535 however public expenditure as a share of gdp has not stabilized
7057536 interest payments on the countrys large national debt continue to absorb a significant share of spending while government subsidies designed to insulate the population from the impact of sharp international increases in the prices of food and other items provide a further hurdle
7057537 unproductive and duplicate spending in the sectors which account for the bulk of government expenditure
7057538 it will also help the ministry of finance and planning find ways to increase the effectiveness of its public spending
7057539 strong fiscal management ultimately supports the development of a sustainable public service delivery mechanism that helps improve social welfare which in turn helps the poor

7057650 you seem to work as hard at rejecting your religion as others might work at changing their sex its one of those impossible things maybe for a few it works out but for the rest everything is a compromise youre not a she youre a he and even if you are you wont be treated as a her and even if you are then at some level still you arent because others say so because you say so because god says so because the past who speaks far louder than god says so
7057651 perhaps my point is simply this dont you know that all catholics reject their religion this is what it means to be catholic didnt you ever learn that we spend our lives rejecting it and feeling guilty for rejecting it and failing to reject it all the same dont you see thats what makes you so canonical a catholic you will always reject you will reject till you are blue in the face but youll never get away because your very rejection is only an affirmation of allegiance thats why to be a catholic is really to be a catholic by way of a second pass a catholic by way of proxy because the first pass is everything that is in the letter and the second pass is the rejection of that letter based upon the structures and arguments you have learned by way of that letter of course you cannot use a thing to dismiss itself it would long ago have dismissed itself without your aid if that were the case no it lives on in you in order that you declare it lives on in you or if you prefer that it doesnt live on in you its all the same but if you really wish to be rid of catholicism you will not do it by way of anything it celebrates or chastises and you will not do it by way of anything you have done

7057741 i think it is unprecedented for a majority to quiet the vote of a justice because they dont like what he is saying on a dissent a justice has a constitutional right to explain his vote they are all equal and they cant muzzle a justice for that
7057742 the obvious result is that a wrongful death action may expire before the decedent does this judicially created rule is without foundation and frankly absurd
7057743 never before has a majority voted to prohibit a dissent in mississippi
7057744 they have at least five votes to do anything they want to do that has led to the attitude that they have the power to do anything they want to do they wanted to test the theory of whether they were able to stifle dissent i think they have gravely misunderstood the power they have
7057745 my only comment would be that the concern here was that justice diaz was not dissenting to the order and in fact agreed with it but rather was expressing his opinion on issues which were pending in the case but which were not before the court at this time the concern is if the case is later appealed his opinion of those issues has already been published to the public i dont think thats appropriate
7057746 thats not to say i wouldnt be upset if i was justice diaz but i think the court probably has the authority to set the policy
7057747 i think theres a real tension between a judges right to dissenting opinions and a general prescription of issuing advisory opinions
7057748 ive been on the court four and a half years and ive never had anyone request to attach a statement to the lower court
7057749 i thought it would be inappropriate to include any statement and to do anything other than send it back to the trial court
7057750 i felt with some of the issues that it would be premature to rule on those issues because the record was not complete
7057751 nobodys trying to quell anybodys rights to exercise their constitutional right to dissent to express their opinion in the case

7057758 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7057759 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7057760 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7057764 sistem ekonomi yang dibangun lebih menguntungkan kalangan pengusaha dan hanya segelintir masyarakat yang menikmatinya
7057765 itulah salah satu penyebab kemiskinan dan kemelaratan yang melanda rakyat indonesia karena kapitalis sama sekali tidak peduli dengan rakyat
7057766 untuk itu gerindra bertekad menjadi wahana dan wadah politik baru yang menjadi harapan rakyat untuk membawa perubahan dan menentukan arah dan kebijakan ekonomi yang selama ini belum berpihak kepada rakyat kecil
7057767 kondisi tersebut harus disikapi dengan tidak memelihara pengusaha yang menganut bisnis kapitalis tetapi pengusaha yang memiliki jiwa nasionalisme yaitu bertekad membangun perekonomian bangsa sehingga dapat meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyat

7057778 weve got three time olympians who are the most decorated athletes in womens water polo over the last eight years internationally
7057779 but this is probably going to be the lowest paying job theyll ever have in their lifetime
7057780 it usually becomes a defensive oriented game less goals scored less action happens it just becomes a stagnant game it just grinds to a halt its just not enjoyable to the eye
7057781 theres more action theres more emphasis on defensive positioning instead of defensive wrestling and with more action its more entertaining to watch

7057790 ive really enjoyed today but they made it tough for me
7057791 the decision change was hard because i didnt have enough time to be 100 per cent ready for the semi final but i got it together for the bronze medal fight
7057792 it means a lot to go through all that and come away with something she added ive been to three olympic games and have one medal even though its not the gold i believe i was good enough to win im really pleased with the bronze considering the way the day went

7057796 we dont tolerate that kind of unsportsmanlike action we took the strongest measures for the safety of athletes and for the dignity of referees
7057797 my opponent was injured and he had one minute to recover he couldnt do it within one minute and the referee declared me the winner

7057805 the reason i think we have not seen a clear pattern in church member giving going down in recession years probably has to do with the fact that churches are generally seen as the layer immediately beyond the family in terms of responsibility accountability relationships
7057806 that may explain why we are not seeing a pattern of things get hard and people immediately cut back on their giving

7057812 i think the democrats are going to have a lot of explaining to do about bidens very intense criticism of barack obamas inexperience in foreign policy and his sharp criticism of obamas positions in iraq and meeting with foreign dictators
7057813 and theres a lot on record biden couldnt have said it better than any republican about obamas inexperience
7057814 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
7057815 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
7057816 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
7057817 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
7057818 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
7057819 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
7057820 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
7057821 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
7057822 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
7057823 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
7057824 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
7057825 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
7057826 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
7057827 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
7057828 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
7057829 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

7057847 dies ist mein bisher bestes ergebnis ich bin aus diesem grund zufrieden da es etwas gedauert hat mich von meiner siebten position zu verbessern die ich bei meinem ersten grand prix hatte
7057848 wir nahmen ber nacht ein paar ver nderungen am setup vor und sie haben sich alle als positiv herausgestellt das team arbeitete gut um das maximum aus den daten zu machen wir hatten nicht erwartet hier so gut abzuschneiden aber es ist eine gute sache beide autos im dritten qualifying teil zu haben meine letzte runde h tte etwas schneller werden sollen aber ich machte in der 12 kurve einen kleinen fehler blockierte die hinterr der beim bremsen
7057849 nun m ssen wir mit unseren f en auf dem boden bleiben denn es liegen morgen eine menge runden vor uns ich freue mich auf das rennen ich denke dass wir eine reale chance haben um punkte fahren zu k nnen
7057850 ich habe immer noch mein problem dass ich auf dem weicheren reifen keine haftung finde wir m ssen also daran arbeiten aber ich bin gl cklich dass unsere leistung besser wird ich bin wirklich froh zum ersten mal im dritten qualifying teil zu sein es ist ein gutes gef hl da ich darauf wartete dass ich auf den elften oder zw lften rang zur ck falle
7057851 auf dieser neuen strecke hier haben wir gesehen dass manche teams in die richtige richtung und manche nicht in die richtige richtung gearbeitet haben das team leistete gute arbeit indem es mir ein auto zur verf gung stellte das heute eines der besten war nun liegt es an mir das maximum daraus im rennen zu machen es wird ein hartes rennen werden ich hoffe jedoch dass ich in einer position sein werde um nach einem guten start um punkte k mpfen zu k nnen
7057852 wir m ssen etwas richtig machen aber ich bin mir nicht sicher was es ist
7057853 dies ist unsere beste qualifying leistung mit sebastian zum ersten mal haben wir beide fahrer in den dritten qualifying teil bekommen
7057854 die tatsache dass dies eine neue strecke ist bedeutet dass wir nicht unsere blichen lehrgelder in bezug auf die mangelnde erfahrung der fahrer zahlen mussten da die bedingungen f r alle identisch waren wir haben hier ein paar neue dinge mitgebracht und alles funktionierte wir sind aus diesem grund gl cklich
7057855 wir hatten die meiste zeit ber an diesem wochenende probleme mit dem speed
7057856 dies ist ein neuer ort was die positionen ein wenig durcheinander gemischt aber wir scheinen einfach nicht die pace der vergangenen rennen zu haben das ist ziemlich frustrierend es gab einige runden mit denen ich zufrieden war aber wir haben es nicht in q3 geschafft
7057857 bei meinem letzten versuch kam ich in kurve f nf etwas weit und verlor vier zehntel auch wenn ich zwei zehntel wieder gutmachte so sorgte der gesamtverlust dazu dass ich den sprung nicht schaffte aber so sind diese qualifyings eben das war wohl meine schlimmste session und ich bin entt uscht
7057858 wir scheinen hier das ganze wochenende schon probleme zu haben auch wenn wir im letzten sektor schnell sind es ist entt uschend auf den r ngen 14 und 17 zu landen nur ein rennen mit vielen zwischenf llen k nnte uns zu punkten verhelfen wir werden abwarten m ssen gratulation an toro rosso die erstmals beide autos in die top 10 brachten
7057859 die woche begann schon mit dem flugzeugabsturz in madrid und dem tod des renault aerodynamikers dino toso schlecht das sollte helfen die richtige perspektive zu finden
7057860 aber das leben geht weiter und wir haben wir verr ckt gearbeitet um zur ckzukommen wir m ssen nun bereits an das n chste rennen in spa denken
7057861 at the hotel we discovered that there were already 48 russian journalists there together with us there were 50 people
7057862 i was the only one representing a foreign news agency the rest were from russian media and they arrived three days before we did as if they knew that something was going to happen earlier at the border crossing we met one man who was taking his wife and children from tskhinvali
7057863 the rhetoric that is coming out of moscow ethnic cleansing and genocide is just way over the top
7057864 its almost approaching the point where there is just no relationship to reality but again certainly the rhetoric is appropriate to a larger operation against georgia to just stop and reverse whatever military gains the georgians made in south ossetia on august 7
7057865 we have complaints against the osce regarding the initial stage of the conflict they were informed by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but they didnt warn the russian peacekeepers
7057866 hey honey thank you for helping get the kids to bed i noticed that the trash wasnt out can i help you with that
7057867 why didnt you take the trash out i told you i needed that done
7057868 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
7057869 it says there are supposed to be many teams coming to the tower for this
7057870 i havent seen any other teams heading towards the tower yet and if i havent then surely neither of you has right
7057871 they dont look like much i doubt theyd even survive the first floor of the tower
7057872 if this puts our position in jeopardy dont think im going to let you off so easily
7057873 god what a bunch of idiots dont they know what that couldve done to me what if id had asthma
7057874 suck it up and lets get going if we cant be the first ones there we should at least be the second ones
7057875 theres no point in trying to overpower me you wont win
7057876 you appear to be at least somewhat sane any reason why youre just standing here
7057877 well they said there was a town at the base of the tower
7057878 oh you poor children having to adventure so far away from home for a simple tower come come rest here a while youre the first two teams here so youll both receive your passes when they are processed tomorrow
7057879 ah you must be two of the teams welcome make yourselves at home well worry about the passes tomorrow
7057880 what is wrong with this town somethings going on now tell us what it is
7057881 people always make this town out to be some grand metropolis to help us prepare for the tower but this is just a shanty town its barely liveable as it is
7057882 and you can tell everyones harbouring ill feelings for everyone else why dont they just leave if they all hate each other so much
7057883 and why dont we see any food growing even outside the tower how can you sustain these people
7057884 if you want your tower passes then fine you can have them and good riddance but stop being such childish nuisances beforehand
7057885 get into the bedroom eat whats there and go to sleep if i hear any more protests about this town then good luck getting out
7057886 dont worry about it for now lets just get some sleep
7057887 hey guys its time to wake up were going to the tower
7057888 am i the only one who finds this whole situation strange
7057889 you know we both do after those questions last night but i dont think theres anything we can do apart from go into the tower and start i doubt we could even get supplies here if we wanted to
7057890 i need to see your passes if you want to climb the tower
7057891 two underage groups in one day i dont envy you good luck up there youll need it
7057892 thin waist large breasts blue hair pointed ears oh great ive died and gone to heaven
7057893 its that place in the sky that you go to when you die unless im in the other place i dont think ive heard of blue haired angels youre not by chance a demon are you
7057894 huh no im myllia a leskyl from leskaria and who are you
7057895 leskle leskaria is that in europe you dont look european im rils an american from the united states of america

7057899 hehe youre on the trystheart its nuvrem 12th in the year 2945 your clothes are being washed because there was blood on them
7057900 geez hes a loud one we shouldve just put him out the airlock with the galordian parts
7057901 but he saved you you cant just go throwing him out into space thats all you ever do with new people is throw them out the airlocks how are you ever going to get a boyfriend with that attitude
7057902 im in the future in space on a trystheart with some leskyls how hard did i hit my head
7057903 were not just some leskyls were trysta and myllia famed leskyl sisters for hire
7057904 get dressed im dropping you off at the next stop
7057905 trysta you and me both know that its our fault hes here and if it werent for him youd be dead or wed still be trying to get the other belt
7057906 look its already enough that me and you split the bills and rewards but 3 ways besides hes a human male hes as useful as dirt
7057907 why are we even talking about that the answer is no were not keeping him
7057908 what if he knows how to cook or something could we keep him then
7057909 but what if he he he knows how to fly
7057910 i dont care if he can fly shoot cook or talk to the dead or even leskrya i dont want him on my ship
7057911 on our planet hes the one who gave all leskyls life he brought you here for a reason
7057912 youve got it on backwards the insignia is supposed to cover your heart
7057913 oh thats what i thought but it didnt feel right it felt tight down there
7057914 ill be back in the room then can i have my clothes back
7057915 this one should fit just fine go try it on
7057916 first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean
7057917 no short answers for me today im sort of the joe biden of education
7057918 there is no other way to end this cycle of sectarian violence absent giving the parties breathing room control over the fabric of their daily lives
7057919 sense of the senate amendment to the fiscal 2008 defense authorization bill
7057920 for maliki and the others to say we dont have the right to express our opinion i dont know who the hell they think they are he said
7057921 partial birth abortion he also opposes federal funding for abortions
7057922 hey im rich and could become even more wealthy if i werent in public service so i have no incentive to stay on the bench
7057923 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7057924 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7057925 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7057926 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7057927 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7057928 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7057929 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7057930 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7057931 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7057932 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7057933 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7057934 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
7057935 considering all the preparation involved for this new circuit its very disappointing not to have any of our cars in the final part of qualifying i am sure we had the potential to do so but potential is not an ultimate result however im sure it will be an interesting race tomorrow in the event here several weeks ago we saw that the safety car can play an important role and we will think hard about our strategy to try to make the most of our situation
7057936 when you are not able to afford a particular treatment in a private health care centre you look forward to getting free medication in something like this
7057937 we wanted to know what are the socioeconomic condition of these people are they given consent forms and counselling
7057938 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
7057939 its like putting up a barrier weve all intermingled for years
7057940 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7057941 weve gotten more aircraft more vehicles more boats more atvs pretty much everything weve got more and weve got more people to man them
7057942 a vigorous fun loving bunch when they are not suffering abdominal cramps or brooding miserably about the future
7057943 oh that the mind could open up so many chambers and fill them with self reproach
7057944 few men realize that their life the very essence of their character their capabilities and their audacities are only the expression of their belief in the safety of their surroundings

7057949 records detailing the workings of a 1990s charitable group working to better education in the city of chicago that are housed at the university of illinois at chicago uic are being shielded from the prying eyes of reporters the significance of these records is that the foundation in question was run by none other than barack obama and the foundation was formed by none other than william ayers the radical weather underground terrorist who obama has referred to as just a neighbor stanley kurtz of the national review has tried to access records of the annenberg challenge on excellence in education and met with a stone wall this despite the fact that the records are supposedly open to the public the records would almost certainly make obama out to be a liar about the extent of his personal relationship with this unreconstructed terrorist
7057950 should take into account the long term future of iraq and not just the immediate present
7057951 there is no doubt that the iraqi authorities have national feelings but this agreement is of the utmost importance to iraqis and it its purport should not focus on just one point of view only that would be insufficient
7057952 shackling parliament with an agreement that would make it impossible to solve the problems the country is going through
7057953 the appearance of armed groups in areas that the security forces have insisted are 100 secure is an indication of a serious breach that we cant be silent about

7057993 viejocowarnial why dont you go and kill innocent civilians in iraq since you so much justify this illegal war
7057994 i cannot help but notice and point out that you disappeared on all the topics regarding the disaster that chavez has brought to venezuela
7057995 your swinish behaviour as usual is only matched by your ignorance belial
7057996 reuters the most anti american anti conservative pro socialist of the major news agencies has mccain with a 5 point lead over mr audacity
7057997 we honor the dead and this young man gave his life fighting the cowards
7057998 the soldiers we have these days volunteer to defend freedom not just for the us but for the entire world not like when there was a draft and the cowards and the pacifists ran to canada
7057999 i thought that waterboarding was illegal under the us constitution
7058000 the us constitution is nothing but a goddamn piece of paper
7058001 i thought that waterboarding was illegal under the us constitution
7058002 the us constitution is nothing but a goddamn piece of paper
7058003 citing another obscure larry flynt like lefty socialist political rag belial cuts and pastes his feeble minded philosophy but so far only the feeble minded like chill and risable by into his five and dime manson like commie ideas
7058004 bush didnt invent freedom he is merely trying to defend it and in doing so has opened the eyes of the rest of the free world that terrorism exists
7058005 we are grateful to the washington post the ny times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected the priomises of discretion for almost forty years
7058006 there are two types of honor from self and from others honor is an opinion held by oneself or by others or by both about ones moral worth and the presence or absence of courage is one of a dozen items used to gauge moral worth
7058007 bushs idea of freedom in iraq is killing over 1 000 000 iraqi citizens in five years and installing a us militry dictatorship behind a window dressing regime of us quislings in baghdad
7058008 someone told me the colts have won one preseason game in the last four years the preseason has no direct correlation to this season the goal is to improve as a team
7058009 unless we want to lose the 20 billion economy of the shore and do it for a lot less energy than wed get for pursuing the renewable energy tax credits then i think drilling doesnt make a lot of sense
7058010 if you ask do you support drilling in order to lower gas prices people will say yes of course that implies drilling will lower gas prices which is false we have an education job to do
7058011 when i voted against the iraq war it was unpopular at the time but it was the right thing to do and people came to understand that
7058012 i think theyll understand that looking to renewable energy sources that can give us 6 million barrels of equivalent energy a day versus only 200 000 barrels with drilling without the risk to our shore and our economy will be the right choice
7058013 the day that the disappearance of the indigenous communities in the jungles and mountains was avoided
7058014 this is a new dawn for the people of this country and for all peruvians who wish to develop in freedom not in oppression
7058015 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would some day remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation
7058016 in some spots in the hinterland the fleays are gone already
7058017 the biggest contributor to their decline is the chytrid fungus which has been transported around the world via toads humans use for medical research
7058018 at the moment we cant stop the fungus in the wild but there are treatments for captive frogs
7058019 over time its hoped frogs in captivity may build up a resilience to it and then be released back into the wild
7058020 in the past 20 years australia has had eight frogs become extinct six of those were in queensland
7058021 we would like to play a bridging role between developing countries and developed countries
7058022 we will announce our 2020 target for greenhouse gases next year
7058023 the target will reduce our emissions from business as usual
7058024 whether its an absolute reduction by 2020 or just a decline in the rise is still to be decided
7058025 i am glad to see that someone at last has such an elevated regard for ministers
7058026 great site have a son in the military keep it up
7058027 i started reading your blog with the hopes that id have help in proving that the war in iraq was a mistake
7058028 good title for the blog good stance on the war i agree with you about the wrongness of the war
7058029 the capitalists imperialists and zionists need to be exposed as you have been doing by showing that the iraq war was wrong
7058030 the best i found around blogs that is talking about the wrongness of iraq war

7058032 when i came in today i was sure i would place
7058033 after the qualification everyone was disappointed today i knew i had to remove the shade from my eyes and do something
7058034 we had talks on many issues and also on the land issue the talks were cordial and most probably we will be able to arrive at some decision in one or two days
7058035 we have discussed and exchanged views in a cordial manner and we have decided to meet again
7058036 till now we have made a loss of about 5000 crore rupees today every businessman wants to cut down the losses and would like our brothers in the amarnath shrine board to sit with the government authorities to find a solution to it
7058037 iaf has maintained amazing serviceability rate in a sustained manner during the entire exercise
7058038 intelligence and out of the box thinking of the technicians of the unit has earned us praise from all quarters
7058039 the sdi software has made the su30mki platform more versatile and compatible with other air forces
7058040 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7058041 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7058042 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
7058043 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
7058044 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
7058045 today is the eighth day of indefinite fast for tibet without food and water and the third batch has entered the eighth day four of the hunger strikers health has become very critical the doctors at ram manohar lohia hospital have advised that the hunger strikers need immediate admission otherwise there is a risk to their life so the police have forcibly without our knowledge taken all the hunger strikers except one
7058046 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
7058047 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
7058048 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
7058049 she expressed that she trusted him to take care of her training and diet
7058050 she indicated that they had expressly agreed that she would not take any prohibited substances however her relationship with her husband was currently conflictual
7058051 is getting the girls phone number the same thing as getting a date with her
7058052 im not going to make any excuses but sacks werent our biggest goal
7058053 our biggest goal was bend but dont break this year our goal is attack attack attack and go straight to the quarterback
7058054 hes got really long arms and gives phenomenal effort every play we have three of those guys there at end
7058055 if you can get pressure out of your base defense then youre way down the road ahead of everybody else
7058056 its just that this year were going to get to show it i feel comfortable saying that
7058057 actually im superman because im superhuman and hes batman because hes got all the tools
7058058 i think we need a sack in every 10 pass attempts
7058059 every six attempts we need a hurry or a pressure
7058060 we should have a lot more sacks this year because were going to get them not just on third down but also on first and second
7058061 were going to be going to them not waiting on them
7058062 a lot of times it just came down to aggressiveness
7058063 wed play for a screen where there wasnt a screen sometimes wed drop linemen into coverage and not even rush the passer
7058064 we have asked them tata motors that if you are facing problems over there in singur we are ready to give you red carpet welcome moreover we have right to say this as they are from this place we have told them earlier as well to come here to set up their plant
7058065 we will see if they approach us as you have seen our state government always welcomes industry which will bring revenues to our state and jobs for our young people we always welcome industry and good investment in our state
7058066 was go tell him last year that we were taking him out of the rotation
7058067 i had a feeling about him in spring training he was just throwing the ball great and was really really consistent
7058068 his sense of how to pitch is unbelievable and with his experience he knows how to get hitters out
7058069 he obviously doesnt have the power fastball like he used to anymore but hes still the same guy hes been for the last three years
7058070 he makes a living away he doesnt like pitching in and he makes you get yourself out
7058071 i know he has pitched against us at least twice maybe three times every time its been a little different
7058072 im not there every day to know why but i would have to say hes probably executed his pitches the way he wants to
7058073 ive just been pleased ive been able to go out there every time its my turn and pitch well
7058074 it depends on what his motivation is is it something we want for him more than he wants for himself
7058075 i think he could get it if he decided to and i think the excitement of this year maybe will motivate him to do that i know it would mean a lot to him but hes also understanding of how much this game takes you away from your family
7058076 if the shoe is banned why do so many athletes win big marathons wearing them i hope to do the same in beijing
7058077 i am very excited to be the first marathoner in the olympics to wear the spira shoes to me it is an honor
7058078 on the one hand the rules create a chilling effect on our ability to recruit elite athletes to race in the shoes at big events
7058079 on the other hand the controversy provides a platform to tell our unique story
7058080 the shoes are not banned and never have been banned
7058081 we have said that from the moment spira started claiming there was a ban
7058082 but i thought the alleged banned in boston was a little over the top
7058083 the spring does not return more than 100 percent energy its in the mid 90s
7058084 so wheres the unfair advantage its not producing energy the wavespring technology is no different from scientific advances made in other sports like graphite golf clubs and oversized tennis rackets
7058085 the rule is there and i guess if someone wanted to challenge someones victory in our shoes theyd be right but im hoping what will happen now that were having all this success is that theyll change the rule
7058086 they have simply never been banned by us or the iaaf the entire effect of this campaign falsely claiming that the shoes are banned has been to get the shoe lots of publicity its entirely false and has always been false
7058087 i need you to be at the finish line when i get done i want you to be there so that we can have pictures and so that we can celebrate together
7058088 i think i did very very well im very pleased with my score of course im pleased with the medal im pleased with the title that comes with the medal im just happy everything worked out
7058089 any time one of the guys in the decathlon is injured or doesnt do well or is laid out your heart goes out to them because you know exactly what theyre going through
7058090 those are all the guys that i look up to we still go back into the books and look at all the things that theyve accomplished and the things that theyve done
7058091 its been a little while since weve had the olympic gold medal in the decathlon brought back to the states so im happy to be the person to do it id love to bring the decathlon back to the forefront of track and field
7058092 i started the day pretty tired as everyone does i didnt fall and i had an ok time so ill take it
7058093 it was long its my first olympics and my first international experience really im not used to the all day schedule we were the first ones out here this morning and the last ones to leave
7058094 nous savions depuis les essais que nous avions une bonne voiture en q1 et q2 la voiture tait super je suis rest en pneus tr s tendre pour mes deux runs en q3 mon premier tour na pas t g nial mais jai t plus content de mon second il y a toujours du temps gagner quelque part mais cest une bonne position de d part comme felipe massa la dit le secteur 1 tait d terminant et cest l quil a d truit tout le monde
7058095 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7058096 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7058097 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7058098 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato
7058099 ill bet the russian government will want to keep some troops in those areas we are not in favour of that and i dont know how we can call them peacekeepers
7058100 we are now collecting the corpses lying in the streets
7058101 the town is calm today and were busy burying the victims of the fighting the islamists are at the abandoned sea and air ports and people here are hoping to reopen their businesses
7058102 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps now they are nowhere to be found
7058103 well continue our war against militiamen and all troops until we rule the whole country by islamic law
7058104 god willing we shall establish an administration for kismayu in the coming days
7058105 we dont know what will happen but we are scared

7058119 embarked on a campaign to take advertising revenue away from the times standard by a variety of illegal methods in order to obtain revenue
7058120 we are not in a position to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit which we feel lacks any merit
7058121 lawsuits involving newspapers carry a special risk that extensive pretrial publicity might disqualify local judges or jurors
7058122 that risk increases when a large newspaper chain has sued a much smaller locally owned newspaper because mr singleton may well believe he has a better chance of winning if he can get this case moved outside humboldt county
7058123 unless we want to lose the 20 billion economy of the shore and do it for a lot less energy than wed get for pursuing the renewable energy tax credits then i think drilling doesnt make a lot of sense

7058139 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7058140 there will be no contact between the navy and the boats
7058141 we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board should an emergency develop
7058142 we are currently experiencing rough sea conditions and we call on the greek government and the international community to meet their responsibilities and protect the civilians on board our two ships in international waters
7058143 when they arrive they will send a messsage to israel and to the rest of the world to pay attention to gaza and to lift the siege
7058144 we hope they will be able to arrive we are optimistic
7058145 the boats will never arrive the israelis will capture them before they get anywhere close to gaza
7058146 i want to be on a design team and published

7058149 the woman seems very plausible and it is likely she will keep trying at different locations
7058150 we are carrying out extra patrols in the area and i hope that by releasing these details we can put a stop to this scam and find the person or people responsible and bring them to justice
7058151 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now

7058157 men of israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men 36 for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody a number of men about four hundred joined him he was slain and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing 37 after this man judas of galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away many people after him he also perished and all who obeyed him were dispersed 38 and now i say to you keep away from these men and let them alone for if this plan or this work is of men it will come to nothing 39 but if it is of god you cannot overthrow it lest you even be found to fight against god

7058161 generally a mans arm span equals his height but in his case its 6 7 three inches more than his height naturally his arms work as powerful propulsive paddles giving him a clear edge over others his lower body interestingly is shorter than that of an average man of his height his relatively short legs result in less drag or resistance in short phelps has an upper body of a 6 8 person but his lower body seems to be of someone who is only 5 10 which also make the perfect plane in water
7058162 a community of god on a pilgrimage through life helping each other to continue as christs disciples and encouraging others to join them on the journey to reach heaven
7058163 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as in heaven
7058164 we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
7058165 it is not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord of hosts
7058166 they have lost their first love and have become cynical disconnected and cold in their love for jesus and other christians
7058167 yet i hold this against you you have forsaken your first love remember the height from which you have fallen repent and do the things you did at first if you do not repent i will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place
7058168 calmness graciousness transparency humility joy grace truth being safe people clear expectations having healthy souls openness and kindness amp patience
7058169 the spirit of the lord is on us because he has anointed us to preach good news to the poor

7058205 if you really want a winning ticket this is it
7058206 ive looked at every other possible candidate no one brings to a ticket what hillary brings 18 million people committed to where shes going
7058207 i think she has the qualifications to be president and i think she would be very strong as a campaigner so youre doing the two things that need to be done to be qualified
7058208 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
7058209 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
7058210 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless
7058211 in some spots in the hinterland the fleays are gone already
7058212 the biggest contributor to their decline is the chytrid fungus which has been transported around the world via toads humans use for medical research
7058213 at the moment we cant stop the fungus in the wild but there are treatments for captive frogs
7058214 over time its hoped frogs in captivity may build up a resilience to it and then be released back into the wild
7058215 in the past 20 years australia has had eight frogs become extinct six of those were in queensland
7058216 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie
7058217 a massive building expansion by milwaukee public schools has saddled the district with tens of millions of dollars worth of vacant or severely underused school additions
7058218 when you build a school youre building it for over 100 years if we would have put up shanties and put up temporary buildings that would have been very shortsighted
7058219 im not interested in a power grab im interested in mps performance but confidence is not high right now
7058220 i have decided that in this time of budget deficits for the state i dont think it is right to accept a full time salary for what should be a part time job
7058221 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
7058222 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7058223 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7058224 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7058225 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7058226 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7058227 we will be negotiating with them about the number and location of checkpoints in the future
7058228 we do have suspicion that the rationale for the rejections might be because of the protests and our activities

7058232 if one tries to look at my strips as good drawings
7058233 its sorta like hov jay z pac big blended with bill withers and miles davis lets add al green folks i miscalculated
7058234 there is nothing i can do to make the dive better or worse
7058235 i thought maybe i could have gotten the bronze or silver medal
7058236 its going to take a while to sink in my cheeks hurt from smiling my face hurts from the chlorine my legs are sore from jumping up and down im in pain and im tired but im so happy
7058237 but full credit goes to matt ever since weve been here hes been training so hard and doing everything hes supposed to
7058238 yo akak i forgot to tell you party theme is by consensus
7058239 it is a good feeling very nice to be able to sit here now
7058240 it helps me forget the last race when i thought i had a victory in my pocket with three laps to go
7058241 i am pretty happy to be on the front row and have a chance of winning this race that is fine for me and the team who did a great job again today
7058242 i am feeling good i like the track i like the whole place and we know it is going to be tough because ferrari are very difficult to beat but we are going to give it our best shot
7058243 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
7058244 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
7058245 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
7058246 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
7058247 i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another
7058248 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is illicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit
7058249 you can make philosophical arguments that are difficult to debate but at the same time youre just sort of ignoring the enormity of the problem
7058250 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
7058251 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
7058252 if youre a developer or a publisher that is considering a third party licensing solution and you dont take a very close look at id tech 5 among the choices of what you consider i really think you just dont understand what your job is and you must be in somebodys pocket
7058253 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
7058254 well that is our job we dont technically get money for the hours we put in but it is our job
7058255 whatever all we know is whoever built these amazing and complex structures from stone and brick nearly 1 000 years ago were regardless of their current name were an amazing and complex people

7058260 ach maakt dat nu uit wie er langskomt ik ben toch alleen
7058261 ik wou nog iets zeggen maar je gooide de hoorn er snel op
7058262 thats too much money i cant spend that much money on something like that
7058263 di sepakbola anda mendapat uang dari gelar jika tidak kami tentunya di rumah saja bermain dengan anak anak

7058265 who could obama have picked who would be worse for progressives
7058266 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

7058275 aidan told me before the king george that you have to really go for him and i was probably a little bit easy on him but today he really picked up and when he sensed the other horse coming to him he had plenty left in the tank
7058276 ive said before that he is very durable very consistent and he tries for you
7058277 you can see the size of him and he has a great will to win hes just a great horse
7058278 soft ground fast ground it doesnt matter hes able to take it he eats up every day and he loves racing
7058279 im a lucky jockey its very easy when you are riding horses like this
7058280 all the team have been amazing to keep him on the go and keep him happening
7058281 we were very worried as he flew over on tuesday spent a couple of hours here and then flew back but he is an amazing horse and has a great constitution
7058282 johnny got there earlier than he wanted to and he doesnt do a lot in front the amazing thing today was the pace he showed and the way he travelled through the race all being well if he comes out of this ok we will go to leopardstown for the irish champion stakes
7058283 its four group ones he has nearly won now and the other horse just got the measure of him up the hill
7058284 hes done everything right they are clear of the rest and im sure his day will come
7058285 hes beaten but definitely not battered he ran a good race and is obviously on the way back
7058286 well regroup and im sure youll see a different horse in two weeks time im not using the ground as an excuse
7058287 i was so honoured to be asked and im so excited to be alongside such talente people
7058288 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7058289 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7058290 i was lucky enough to be back in london last week and had a lot of spare time in the hotel so i was watching the olympics all day it was great to see the cycling was so impressive and it was great for chris hoy to have achieved what he did
7058291 its nice to see many people getting so emotional about winning medals and it makes you proud to be british
7058292 when i first heard leonas voice its one of those voices you get goosebumps from its honour for me to actually be up there with them and its going to be spectacular
7058293 when i knew who was going to involved in it i thought why do they want me
7058294 i was just so honoured to be asked im really excited about it
7058295 im from hackney and im so proud its coming to london and how its going to regenerate the area for my area especially its going to mean new jobs new opportunities and i just cant wait
7058296 its so big and amazing here in beijing but londons going to do it differently and uniquely and its going to be amazing its own way
7058297 initially they requested to use whole lotta love then it was you can play guitar on it if you want to then it was said leona was going to sing on it and it just got a momentum of its own its going to be really great
7058298 the olympics is going to bring a whole spirit of optimism to london and its going to be fantastic
7058299 close doesnt count this isnt horseshoes or hand grenades were trying to capture or kill this man we dont even know if hes alive for sure
7058300 ik sloeg een tijdschrift open en toen zag ik een
7058301 when i grow up i want to do what you do
7058302 we really have to understand the heart of the product
7058303 for example if an electronic device has to convey a sense of quickness we will choose all the correct materials and finishes that will convey that thought and be appealing to their demographic our goal is to resonate with the consumer
7058304 we really looked at the bed as a room in and of itself
7058305 were in it for the long haul it must be a marriage of intuition and logic we arent about the collective hunch we do our homework
7058306 i define mine beyond that its about loving it long enough to want to keep it around
7058307 i thought i was going to have an idea factory when i grew up i was going to create ideas
7058308 its become like a neutral youre finding it so much more than you ever found it in china or korea pink is revered pink has become pervasive
7058309 we just worked on launching this whole new brand called coalesse thats trying to span the live work market those two environments are really overlapping its really important to understand what people are surrounding themselves with to create a space that serves both functions

7058312 were seeing so much more purple of course purple comes about from a sense of royalty but its also very spiritual
7058313 we have very two dimension worlds with our computers everything is fast and furious theres very little time to ponder or touch and i think that people still want to engage on that level things with texture are compelling
7058314 its very special its very special to me its not easy to achieve this for me after hard work after so much effort
7058315 its not easy to achieve these good results so im happy
7058316 im feeling good it was a fantastic race it was a fantastic day for me it was very special
7058317 my plan was to pick up the pace very fast it was a very fast race
7058318 it was so long until we got a medal then we won a silver and that really inspired me
7058319 i think i still dont believe it winning gold before coming i wanted to go home with a seasons best or a personal best jumping 2 05m in these conditions is very hard
7058320 i never expected to beat blanka because for almost a year she has been unbeatable but it was nice to be at your best at big championships
7058321 i am always ready to go at big moments i think there is a reason why i have so many gold medals at home
7058322 having been beaten a head in the sussex stakes its nice to come here and win a consolation race
7058323 i was satisfied with his run in the st jamess palace stakes but when i left goodwood after the sussex i was not satisfied and im going to leave it there
7058324 im hoping for good ground at ascot in the qeii and that all three leading three year olds henrythenavigator ravens pass and tamayuz turn up im not afraid to take henry on again but soft ground would mean wed be an unlikely runner

7058332 the fourth set was the key because i managed to win it 11 7 after being behind 3 6
7058333 this is possibly the happiest and most glorious moment of my life
7058334 its not good for our sport when one count is so dominant
7058335 the chinese have said they will open their doors after the olympics
7058336 i was preparing my tactical plan for the fight thinking that there would be four rounds but in the course of the first round i felt that i could box more intensively
7058337 we spent all day yesterday watching videos of boonjumnong because we knew that it has to be an effective strategy to fight against him
7058338 for the past 12 years i have been through many obstacles if i didnt fight through those challenges then id just be a normal boxer
7058339 everyone who puts in effort on the job that they do can become a success like me
7058340 the judges should have taken some points from him and even disqualified him
7058341 he used the same tactics the last time we fought but this time he threw more punches and i couldnt avoid them
7058342 this verdict is unfair i have won the bout i have won it

7058404 a ten per cent increase is possible if the fuel prices do not come down significantly the indian aviation industry has suffered a collective loss of about one billion us dollars last year
7058405 we see things improving but we are not at all out of the woods
7058406 the room to manoeuvre at this moment is limited any marginal changes in the prices will not enable us to make any significant move
7058407 marginal and that reduction is not reflected in the prices charged by our fuel companies you have the currency effect also we will see how oil companies price aviation turbine fuel atf by the end of this month or the first week of next month
7058408 we will keep the options open on slashing fuel surcharge but ask all the airlines to take a decision together all of us have to work together in the upcoming peak season to see if there is scope to do something

7058411 i think you lose your lead for every product that exists on the market theyll soon be a better version
7058412 in consumer electronics youve got to be very fickle and pay close attention to the product lifecycle you have to take a much more holistic approach from linking all of that demand sensing back to supply planning and if this stuff is all coordinated inside nintendo it doesnt appear that way in the u s market

7058415 on the one hand you need to reassure the markets that the fed and u s treasurys resources are deep and wide with the creation of new institutions if necessary to adjust to shifting or unique conditions
7058416 on the other hand you want to convey discipline and perseverance on inflation which is elevated i think bernanke achieved both with his speech
7058417 i think the bias is toward cutting rates at least once perhaps twice i see two quarter point rate cuts in the fall really
7058418 growth conditions are so weak and unemployment claims are arcing to such a degree in the country that the fed will need to cut rates

7058500 agree that deficit reduction did an enormous amount of good
7058501 usher in the 1990s boom and the only period of strong broad based income growth in a generation
7058502 total federal debt grew more rapidly in the 1980s than at any time since world war ii
7058503 democrats blamed president reagans tax cuts and defense build up pointing out that between 1980 and 1986 in terms of percent of gross domestic product income tax revenue fell by almost 20 percent and military outlays grew by 30 percent this led to an increase in the deficit equal to about 3 percent of gdp
7058504 at its core the deficit reflected anemic growth in productivity and income after 1973
7058505 as fast between 1970 and 1990 as between 1950 and 1970 revenue probably would have been sufficient to fund all of washingtons obligations

7058507 will all the electric cars simply be made in china
7058508 as europes regulated economies have struggled and asias move to capitalism has spurred its fabulous boom many liberals have come to appreciate the virtues of markets
7058509 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
7058510 policies often involve setting up a government program to address a market failure but then trying to harness the power of the market within that program
7058511 according to some estimates we cannot track 2 3 trillion in transactions

7058517 what tends to distinguish democratic economists is that they set out to uncover imperfections of the market and then come up with incremental market based solutions to these imperfections

7058526 joey is one of my favorite players of all time
7058527 the energy passion love of the game and leadership he brought to the ballpark day in and day out are seldom seen in todays ballplayer it is no coincidence that our two most successful teams at uno in the past 25 years came with joey in our program he is a winner and makes everyone around him better
7058528 joey has the talent to make it but what sets him apart is his heart joey battles you just dont get a bad day out of him he can go 0 for 4 one game but you would never know it by his attitude hes a subdued guy but once you get inside there is a permanent bond he is just a special person
7058529 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7058530 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7058531 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7058532 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7058533 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7058534 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7058535 it is clear from the poor working class poor communities that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently than those who are poor
7058536 its a massive club and even compared to premiership teams rangers are bigger than a lot of them so it wasnt really a hard choice for me
7058537 when i came here on loan last season i didnt really know a lot about the other clubs
7058538 but having played against them i know there are no easy games in this league that was proved last season with the games that we had
7058539 people looking in from the premiership probably think its a weaker league but its definitely not easy
7058540 coming here you can take it positively or negatively and i chose to take it as a positive
7058541 hopefully it will drive the boys on to go one step better than last year and win the title and get back into europe next season
7058542 thats the ultimate aim this season and we have to be fully focused on that
7058543 the boys have got off to a good start so far we have a couple of tough games coming up but we are looking to continue that run of results
7058544 there is a good squad here possibly stronger than last year and the competition for places can only stand the club in good stead
7058545 there is good competition for places and the manager has signed a number of midfielders now to add to the players who were already here
7058546 no one has the god given right to start every game you have to perform and my aim is to give 100 every time i put on the jersey and hopefully i can stay in the team
7058547 it was a major disappointment to lose there on the final day of the season
7058548 there is a good rivalry between the clubs and its a tough place to go we know that from last year but hopefully we can go there and get a better result than we did at the end of last season
7058549 hindsight is a great thing and i would have done things a lot differently
7058550 i didnt handle the whole contract situation too well and i should have not come to that decision
7058551 it wasnt a mistake but its a decision i might have got wrong and i hope the fans dont hold it against me too much
7058552 i know its going to be difficult i will need to perform well enough to win the majority of them back round
7058553 hopefully i get a good reception but if its mixed hopefully my performances will show that im 100 behind all the other players and 100 happy to be here
7058554 i wouldnt say regret but at the time i probably knew in my heart of hearts it wasnt the right move
7058555 i dont want to disrespect the club i was at but i think they knew in the first few months i really struggled but thankfully i came back
7058556 i know i am going to have a right hard battle trying to get in this team
7058557 the squad is a lot stronger since i left but i am looking forward to it
7058558 i think everyone knows that roy keane would like to sign me permanently
7058559 i had a taste of premier league football with sunderland last season and it made me want more
7058560 i wanted to join sunderland this summer but sir alex ferguson made it clear that he needs me for cover at the back and has said that i will get games
7058561 i think that if it gets to the stage where i am not getting enough games then he would allow me to leave in order for my career to progress
7058562 every player will tell you that there is nothing better than playing week in week out but some times you have to be patient due to the circumstances
7058563 i will continue to work hard at united and who knows what may happen in the future
7058564 turn out to be winners although hes no bargain because he was already considered the best in the world
7058565 chances are good that if hed done only slightly worse they might not really be getting their moneys worth because im sure they were cutting deals based on his potential
7058566 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
7058567 ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful sic to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
7058568 michael embodies the values behind our frosted flakes earn your stripes programme
7058569 as an official sponsor of the 2008 us olympic team and a proud sponsor of phelps it is only fitting that kellogg company feature this world class athlete on its iconic boxes of kelloggs corn flakes and kelloggs frosted flakes cereals
7058570 john mccain now looks like hes had a lot of botox to paralyze his frown and worry lines on his forehead

7058572 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
7058573 your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
7058574 they are choosing individuals who would have evidence for good development which means that maybe their offspring would be more healthy and have good development as well
7058575 its the same way that heterosexual femininity is packaged and sold to female consumers

7058578 volevo essere in pole e ho raggiunto questo risultato sono orgoglioso di essere il primo su questo circuito ammette il ferrarista ho fatto un buon giro nonostante le insidie e penso che per domani la gara p tr essere favorevole alla nostra macchina abbiamo visto che col passare dei giri aumenta sempre il grip e migliora il bilanciamento per cui abbiamo ottenuto un grande risultato abbiamo dimostrato che siamo competitivi e questa la cosa pi importante
7058579 e stata una qualifica piuttosto semplice e la monoposto andava abbastanza bene poi nel primo giro ho fatto un piccolo errore mentre nel secondo le cose sono andate meglio ha spiegato langlocaraibico il team ha fatto un fantastico lavro e sono fiducioso per domani essere secondo e non prima non mi preoccupa
7058580 dopo alcune gare difficili credo che abbiamo ritrovato il nostro assetto migliore e si visto con questo risultato in qualifica domani andr per fare pi punti possibili ben consapevoli che ci saranno molte insidie e molti colpi di scena spero di fari girare le cose a mio favore

7058734 at first you think they must be someone who isnt all there but when the 20th person comes up to you and says it you realise theres a pattern
7058735 they say we have no sense of humour they ask if the show starts on time oh and they say you bombed my chip shop
7058736 i would have a show there where i said in german i would be performing for 45 minutes in english
7058737 that would let the audience see what the british comedy circuit was like then there would be an interval and afterwards we would speak in german about stereotypes
7058738 that certainly is a concept that i think has got lots of legs

7058748 we are very happy with felipes first place and he really drove very well
7058749 it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time for our part we will do our utmost to try and bring home the best possible result in terms of the championship
7058750 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7058751 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7058752 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying
7058753 i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasnt perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however felipe massa was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope wellbe able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and im confident well be strong
7058754 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7058755 today we saw another very good afternoons work from both lewis and heikki characterised by strong lap times that reflect their respective race strategies all in all therefore were well prepared for the first grand prix to be held on this exciting new racetrack all the drivers did an exemplary job today in fact avoiding the walls in the tricky conditions we hope that tomorrows race will be equally incident free and that in time the valencia event will become a regular integral and much admired element of the formula 1 calendar i would like to offer our congratulations to all concerned and to the valencia authorities in particular with appropriate promotion this grand prix promises to become a fabulous adjunct to our sports existing harbourside spectacular namely monaco

7058905 we will allow the two boats to arrive in gaza in order to avoid a well publicised provocation in the middle of the sea
7058906 and because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land

7058909 nach zuletzt ein paar ungl cklichen rennen ist unser auto hier in valencia nicht schlecht
7058910 es war ein sehr gutes qualifying f r unser team und f r mich trotzdem gibt es noch einen kleinen r ckstand zu ferrari und mclaren
7058911 auch auf dieser neuen und anspruchsvollen strecke hat robert erneut ein hervorragendes qualifying absolviert und sich platz drei in der startaufstellung erk mpft
7058912 robert fuhr sehr gut und hat vom dritten startplatz aus eine ausgezeichnete ausgangslage f rs rennen
7058913 ich habe mich kurz extrem ge rgert und dachte es kann nicht sein dass das zwei mal passiert ich musste mich dann schnell beruhigen weil gleich die n chste runde kam
7058914 wenn ich raus fahre bekomme ich vom team gesagt schnelles auto hinter dir 1 15 sekunden oder was auch immer dann kann das nicht passieren
7058915 es ist wichtig f r mich zu sehen dass die pace da ist wenn es einmal halbwegs passt
7058916 die runde war nicht perfekt aber viel weiter nach vor w re es nicht gegangen
7058917 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
7058918 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid
7058919 our free practice pace was genuine and we have definitely made some improvements to the car over the break and here this week today i felt we could have had one car in the top ten rubens has been struggling with the car all day and we never really managed to overcome those problems jenson however had the car working very well as we saw with his first run in qualifying when he was using the prime tyre he then switched to option tyres but they didnt work at all for him and he could not match his early time with the mid pack being so close he was just squeezed out of q2 contention

7058927 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7058928 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7058929 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7058930 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7058931 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different

7058934 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points that is again our target tomorrow its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
7058935 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy

7058937 i dont believe it shows strong backbone to have said no tax increases publicly for years and years and years and then to change your position overnight
7058938 im in the jewish book of famous people but as far as you know on the professional level i think its pretty common knowledge that im half black or whatever i was never really fazed by the sort of the color barrier you know
7058939 one of the funniest experiences i had when i began working in the art world is that people always assumed i worked for thelma golden not that i was thelma golden the kind of dismissal that comes from just peoples sense that they dont imagine you are who you are actually has been one of the most powerful and liberating things for me in my work
7058940 theres always going to kind of be an overreaction one way or the other regarding your presence be it good or bad
7058941 what you tend not to see are films on black people radiating in the pleasure of their success and telling their stories
7058942 you come to the point whenever you see a black person on television its either a comedy or some tragic issue being spoken to you wouldnt think that black people could get through a competently managed day let alone being successful at it
7058943 it cant be all over as long as we have young african american boys and girls who are not able to get the quality education they need
7058944 or are still being held back because people are looking down on them
7058945 almost all of the african american writers that i know were very much uninterested in one area of the world which is white men
7058946 that frees up a lot it frees up the imagination because you dont have that gaze you know and when i say white men i dont mean just the character but i mean the establishment the reviewers the publishers and the people who are in control so once you erase that from your canvas you can really play
7058947 i said once i am the most underestimated eight time grand slam champion ever
7058948 its a lot more than just hitting the ball as hard as you can
7058949 its all about strategy and moving your opponent and just really figuring them out like i never get credit for mental and i just its you know frustrating but at the end of the day i am very happy with me and im very happy with my results
7058950 you dont need anything else but what i have to offer
7058951 ik had me zeer veel voorgesteld van dit toernooi maar dat heeft het niet gebracht dit was dramatisch
7058952 ik heb die wedstrijd tegen pakistan er bewust nog bijgehaald maar nu gebeurt het wederom maar ik denk niet dat dit keer de instelling ontbrak ik vraag me wel af hoe het zat met het bewustzijn of ze wel nadachten op wat voor manier we tegen australi moesten spelen ik heb me op bepaalde momenten behoorlijk ge rgerd

7058961 im looking for task and notes sync with exchange like all mac exchange users its really frustrating to wait for release to find out that its not included in entourage 2008 the macbu has been incredibly vague about exchange support from my viewpoint and as an ex msft employee you guys really missed the mark with this release full exchange support should have been on the top of the list at least help us better understand why we dont have it now and if we can ever expect it
7058962 i agree that these are top demands from customers and we do intend to deliver them to the product as i stated on the forums weve added dozens of new exchange features to entourage in the last few years as regular free updates to the product we had a quality and reliability issue as a result of adding so much to the app for 2008 we stepped back and focused on solidifying the app making things work as youd expect so that in future releases what you get is reliable while we could have checked off more features in a list we want to bring the functionality in a way that truly works
7058963 as a windows windows mobile exchange and mac user i feel that my exchange data tasks 1st notes a distant second is land locked on the windows platform entourage is the only reasonable client for mac exchange integration so how do i get my tasks syncd across all of my devices and pcs i was hoping that youd do it for me you didnt like many users ive been waiting a long time to get this fixed
7058964 the missing info is how much longer do i have to wait to get parity with outlook in terms of sync services read that as tasks 1st notes whenever can you offer any guidance a lot of us want to know

7058974 a massive building expansion by milwaukee public schools has saddled the district with tens of millions of dollars worth of vacant or severely underused school additions
7058975 when you build a school youre building it for over 100 years if we would have put up shanties and put up temporary buildings that would have been very shortsighted
7058976 im not interested in a power grab im interested in mps performance but confidence is not high right now
7058977 i have decided that in this time of budget deficits for the state i dont think it is right to accept a full time salary for what should be a part time job
7058978 if you really want a winning ticket this is it
7058979 ive looked at every other possible candidate no one brings to a ticket what hillary brings 18 million people committed to where shes going
7058980 i think she has the qualifications to be president and i think she would be very strong as a campaigner so youre doing the two things that need to be done to be qualified
7058981 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
7058982 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
7058983 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless

7058986 ik wist dat ze tot grootste dingen in staat was
7058987 het zat goed tussen de oren ik moest alleen aan lopen en springen denken en dat deed ik prima
7058988 ik bekeek het hoogte per hoogte en mijn spirit van de meerkamp zal ook wel een rol gespeeld hebben
7058989 maar ik had niet verwacht dat het zo goed zou lopen 2 05 meter is gewoon super
7058990 ik weet eigenlijk niet wat mijn geheim is maar het gaat in elk geval goed natuurlijk heb ik hard gewerkt maar dat geldt voor iedereen hier

7058995 zoals altijd staat tia er wanneer ze er moet staan
7058996 ik weet nog niet goed welk gevoel ik hier moet opkleven maar ik ben supergelukkig
7058997 tia was al goed tijdens de kwalificaties al waren de omstandigheden toen anders
7058998 maar ik wist dat ze tot grootse dingen in staat was ik zag haar twee weken geleden springen in yantai het zag er toen heel goed uit
7058999 ik heb haar voort vertrouwen geschonken en tussendoor geprobeerd haar wat af te leiden
7059000 ik besef het eigenlijk nog niet dit is mijn eerste olympische kampioene maar het voelt alleszins erg goed aan
7059001 ik heb n fout gemaakt op een cruciaal moment en dat kost me de olympische titel ik wist dat hellebaut goed zou zijn want dat is ze altijd op grote toernooien ik voelde niet echt extra stress toen ik over 2 07 meter moest geloof me die stress was er al van bij het begin
7059002 dit is onbeschrijfelijk ik voel enorm veel blijdschap voor tia en wim
7059003 tia is wereldklasse niet alleen op sportief vlak maar ook als mens
7059004 ik heb het genoegen gehad haar beter te leren kennen en ze is een modelatlete sereen rustig en gefocust

7059017 biden premised his presidential candidacy on the notion that obama was unqualified and not ready from day one you can expect that the mccain campaign or the rnc will run a national television advertisement featuring bidens many and various quotations to this effect that obama apparently picked him demonstrates a recognition that the democratic ticket ought to be more than just about obamas personality or a statement of bipartisan pragmatism its easy to float on gossamers when the world is safe but when its burning down a guy like biden is just the ticket
7059018 i think the nation should offer profound thanks to barack obama for the biden choice because of the real possibility that there will be unexpected moments of comedy between now and election day for the thing is that biden doesnt just have a big mouth he actually has an identifiable problem its called logorrhea when he starts speaking it is nearly impossible for him to figure out how to stop almost every blunder he has made in the past decade is due to the free associating that is the ancillary effect of his prolixity

7059023 planned parenthood is definitely involved in more than abortion its also deeply invested in sexualizing the youngest of our children so that theyll be lifelong dependents on planned parenthoods lucrative contraceptive and sexually transmitted disease services as well
7059024 this is part of an orchestrated effort to get the community to accept an organization that is inherently disgusting and despicable
7059025 planned parenthoods master advertisers can dress it up all they want but the truth will still prevail planned parenthood wants to get your kids hooked on sex and then rake in the abortion and contraceptive profits

7059060 wat ik ongelooflijk vond aan deze wagen was zijn verbruik we hebben flink wat kilometers afgelegd alle soorten wegen en verkeer meegemaakt en de boordcomputer gaf slechts 6 7 l 100 km aan dat is een prestatie een tweede positief aspect was de stille motor gewoonlijk let je onbewust op het geluid van de motor om te schakelen hier hoorde ik niets en vergat ik bijna te schakelen misschien ook wel omdat ik zelf een automaat gewoon ben maar hij schakelde wel vlot en die zesde versnelling is aangenaam op de snelweg
7059061 binnen heb je een zee van ruimte voor en achteraan ook de koffer is immens toppunt was dat we ze maar voor een stuk gebruikt hebben lacht waren we toch wel een deel van onze bagage voor het weekend vergeten zeker veel te happig om te vertrekken vermoed ik t is echt een comfortabele reisauto de kleurkeuze zat ook goed een licht blauwgrijze metaalkleur en zwarte lederen zetels knap hoor
7059062 het is een mooie en stijlvolle auto daar waren we het allemaal over eens maar het is ongelooflijk wennen als je uit een monovolume komt in en uitstappen gaat zoveel vlotter en die hoge zitpositie zou ik eigenlijk ook niet meer willen missen maar dat is persoonlijke voorkeur

7059064 als eerste kennismaking met hyundai was dit een schitterende ervaring de auto zelf beviel me ook oprecht de lijn de motor het sportieve van deze toch wel klassieke auto al ben ik ervan overtuigd dat het met een automaat n g fijner cruisen zou zijn

7059099 hillview crests scores were up in every grade level and every subject
7059100 beth davies in her first year as principal and her entire staff both teachers and classified employees should be commended and its obvious that the students and their parents did a lot of hard work
7059101 i cant remember a year when we had this much improvement in our test scores or when so many schools had such dramatic gains in the same year
7059102 part of it i think comes because we have a strategic plan in place and part of it is just the good old fashion hard work put in by our students and their parents and our teachers and support staff
7059103 id also like to thank our board of education for its support as the district has intensified its focus on teaching and learning
7059104 unfortunately because of the budget cuts that were forced on us by the state this year were having to give back this year some of the gains we made in student to teacher ratios and for now were unable to act on our hopes of reducing class size in grades 4 and 5
7059105 frankly the states making it harder to make the kind of improvement were celebrating today short term for this year we need the legislature to simply do its job and pass a budget long term we need the governor and the legislature to get serious about finding new revenue sources and stabilizing the budget for schools
7059106 mathematically that could have accounted for a few percentage points regardless the improvement across the board is impressive
7059107 our teachers are taking seriously the necessary work of incorporating standards into their daily curriculum
7059108 and were starting to see the benefits that small learning communities offer in terms of collaboration and the chance for teachers to share strategies and problem solve together

7059112 i agree with your comments to the extent that i can while almost totally disagreeing with tom hayden always hard to attribute cause accurately to statistical vicissitude however i feel this loss of luster in the obama campaign presidency isnt due to a movement to the center or his forsaking the farther left far left has now become a very inaccurate and misused label i believe obama was a centrist from the start maybe moreso than bill clinton i believe many on the father left were fooled by their own prejudices an exciting young black democratic candidate many assumed he was a true progressive i believe many misinterpreted his promise for change as being a change in us policy from its current extrapolated line i always interpreted as a change in the timber of the debate away from partisanship and nothing more his moving to the right will occur not because hes become an appeaser but because his policy was always that of appeasing the right to reduce the violence of debate i dont agree with obama or more accurately this depiction of him but i do understand why he might make this the goal of his presidential campaign i post this here rather than directly to tom hayden because a i dont even know who tom hayden is though the name sounds a bit familiar and b i actually thought from some previous posts that bob held at least a suspicion that inherently obamas policies were deliberately targeted to a moving center ill add to this in my own blog when i get a chance this is in the blog queue somewhere
7059113 and to clarify the reason i believe obamas poll numbers are falling is that his followers even some of his most ardent are realizing that he never was what they thought he was a revolutionary mainstream american politician or as much as such a thing can exist
7059114 in celebration of all things that carry flees and slobber uncontrollably at the sight of food and no im not talking about triathletes

7059154 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7059155 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7059156 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7059157 after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7059158 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7059159 a good qualifying session very close and made even more uncertain because of the weather
7059160 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix
7059161 its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive
7059162 the team worked hard to make the most of the data we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking
7059163 now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
7059164 i am still having my problem of not finding grip on the
7059165 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not
7059166 we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
7059167 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not the team did a good job of giving me a car that was one of the best today now it is up to me to get the most out of it in the race its bound to be a tough race but i hope to be in a position to fight for points after making a good start
7059168 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isnt the case in every team i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there generally speaking im a lot happier with my car today on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
7059169 on this new and demanding track robert had a great qualifying again and fought his way through to p3 on the grid nick improved in the second part of qualifying and made it into q3 with the third best time overall his last lap wasnt perfect as he lost some time in the second sector anyway eighth is good what these positions are worth we shall see tomorrow during the first pit stops we had no technical problems during qualifying
7059170 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
7059171 considering all the preparation involved for this new circuit its very disappointing not to have any of our cars in the final part of qualifying i am sure we had the potential to do so but potential is not an ultimate result however im sure it will be an interesting race tomorrow in the event here several weeks ago we saw that the safety car can play an important role and we will think hard about our strategy to try to make the most of our situation
7059172 in a country where unemployment is pervasive and opportunities are limited illegal human traffickers do not have to try too hard to mislead the millions of job seekers
7059173 although human trafficking is a relatively new issue of migration it is becoming more and more a concern for both the government and non government organisations working in the field
7059174 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7059175 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race
7059176 we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7059177 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon
7059178 i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential
7059179 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
7059180 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
7059181 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
7059182 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
7059183 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it
7059184 this year theres an element of the skies falling on
7059185 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
7059186 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7059187 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7059188 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7059189 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7059190 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7059191 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7059192 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7059193 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7059194 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7059195 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7059196 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7059197 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7059198 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7059199 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7059200 were in discussion with a few organizations and affliction is one of them
7059201 they are at the top of our list as far as drew is concerned hes made a great turnaround with his life and training he is ready to move forward
7059202 i knew that was going to happen that the ball would find me and that id have to test my legs
7059203 its a tough decision a very difficult decision ive been wrestling with for days
7059204 its difficult to send out players who have played well
7059205 i knew that was going to happen that the ball would find me and that id have to test my legs

7059208 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
7059209 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
7059210 im not focused on trying to match the soaring rhetoric or levels of excitement that we had four years ago obama said in a 22 minute interview with the chicago tribune aboard his campaign plane
7059211 this is much more a yeoman like task of making the case for my presidency and the need to moe american a fundamentally different direction
7059212 i think the most import thing we can do is to make the choice this november clear to the voters i think we are at a historic crossroads the economy is not working for ordinary americans its not just the steady accumulation of bad news higher unemployment higher inflation i think people recognize partly because of high gas prices that weve got structural problems that have to be attended to peoples incomes and wages are flat and their costs are rising the social compact that delivered health care and pensions through jobs are going away and so people are i think are worried that if we dont deal with these issues now that our standard of living could if not decline at least remain stagnant so what we want to do with this convention is be very clear john mccains policies do not dramatically differ from george bushs and so we should not expect a different outcome if on the other hand were willing to push for real change and the promise of a clean energy economy a health care system that works for all americans college thats more affordable investments in science and technology and infrastructure all those things can lay the groundwork for a more unified and more prosperous and more balanced economy down the road so thats the most important goal we have set now obviously we want to also make sure that the american people have a clear sense of who i am coming out of the convention not because this election is about me but rather because i dont want the republican strategy of attacking my character or misrepresenting my biography to get in the way of peoples ability to make a clear decision about the issues
7059213 rain i cant do much about weve got to trust the meteorologists that say rain is very unlikely in denver that time of year you know in terms of the speech you know in some ways four years ago was special because i didnt know any better i just sat in a hotel room watching a basketball game and wrote it up most of it sort of in one sitting and it went through a bunch of revisions but basically the framework of the structure was there this speech requires more thought more preparation and you know im collaborating with my speechwriters more in making some of the key arguments that i think have to be made
7059214 four years ago was special because it was a surprise to people i was new on the national scene and so i think some of the language that i used then was new people have now heard me speak for the last four years and very intensely for the last two and so you know in some ways theyve seen it and heard it before so im not focused on trying to match the soaring rhetoric or levels of excitement that we had four years ago this is much more a yeoman like task of making the case for my presidency and the need to moe american a fundamentally different direction
7059215 were going to just keep on hammering away at what my plan is and how it contracts with what we have seen over the last eight years and what john mccain proposes but john youve been on the campaign trail with me this week you were at two town hall meetings today i think youd be hard pressed to suggest that
7059216 and so the question you know not to push the point but if the people in my town hall meetings are getting a very clear sense of what i stand for and the folks in the public at large arent and theyre getting most of their information from you guys you know it raises a real question i suspect that this week you know the press has devoted 90 percent of its time to vp speculation despite having no information on it so you know were always wrestling with that challenge and well try to use our tv spots to communicate these issues but we only have 60 seconds i do think that to some degree the debates will be very important on this front because my suspicion is that viewer ship is going to be very high and will give us unmediated ability to talk to the american people about what we plan to do
7059217 im not somebody as you know who spends a lot of time obsessing with polling i mean if i did about this time last year i would have dropped out of the race we always anticipated this race was going to be relatively tight its not as if coming out of the primary season we had some huge lead and we had a bruising primary battle john mccain had three four months where basically his views were unchallenged so i dont think its surprising that the race has tightened i think that although the american people know we need change john mccains been in pubic life for 25 years hes got a compelling biography im relatively new and people are going to take their time and lift the hood and kick the tires before they make their final decision on this race
7059218 leading into the convention it was always our belief that its important to amplify what the differences are between the two campaigns and the two candidates partly because thats one of the ways that we can get the press to write about the issues and let people know you know what i plan to do as president
7059219 well look you know i would suggest that enduring torture is a fairly unique experience that no president or very few presidents have undergone what i would point to is the journey ive traveled throughout my entire life you know its pretty unlikely that i ended up here i wasnt born into prominence was raised by a single mom i had to scratch and claw my way to the point i am now and i think ive done so without cutting corners or compromising my integrity and maybe it looks easier than it is
7059220 well you know i think the choices ive made in my adult life to work as a community organizer instead of taking more lucrative offers to work as a civil rights attorney rather than go to a white shoe law firm all those decisions have been consistent with my belief that a life of service is a way of expressing ones patriotism you know i think military service is one of those paths to service and one that i have the highest regard for
7059221 i feel like we have done a pretty good job this summer if you got the transcripts of all the speeches weve made on everything from afghanistan to energy to fixing the economy thats a pretty substantive body of work we have not devoted a lot of time to silliness i have pointed out policy contrasts with john mccain but i havent spent time attacking his character over the last month weve had to respond to a series of attacks that are fairly typical of what republicans have done during the presidential races over the last 20 years so it is a challenge to make sure that you respond forcefully without getting distracted and part of my goal is to make sure that were not spending time talking about me but that were talking about the american people the fact that theyre losing their homes losing their jobs losing their pensions you know if i can consistently push the argument in that direction then i think we will have done the american people a valuable service
7059222 i think first and foremost the leader of america and promoting americas national interests thats the job description keeping americans safe and secure growing the american economy but i think now more than ever the fate of americas economy our long term security also depends on our ability to forge alliances and partnerships with other countries and certainly the lines between foreign policy and economic policy blurred when trade and technology have shrunk the globe and made goods and services move across boarders with lightening speed issues like terrorism are transnational so my job as president would be to look after the american people and their safety and security but part of that job involves being able to see beyond our own horizon
7059223 i actually think this has been a very humbling experience you know the longer im at this the more i realize how many problems have mounted over the last eight years how many tough decisions were going to have to make to dig ourselves out of the hole that were in you know ive also learned how solid the american people how generous they are and how decent they are you know they really need help right they need leadership right now and so i think its very humbling to be in the position im in knowing that you know im one man and you know will make the occasional mistake what keeps me up at night is not losing the election but its you know making sure that i can deliver on the promises that are being made in the course of this campaign and you know the broader promise of america that people still believe in
7059224 im not sure that gimmicks are whats required i think just hard work were going to hit the ground and campaign a lot of places and talk to people and listen to them and explain to them the choice they face in november and if we do that i think well win
7059225 yes theres no doubt over the course of 19 months youre going to have your good weeks and youre going to have your bad weeks and youre going to have speeches where youre hitting on all cylinders and others that are you know painful to listen to or to deliver but overall i think we get better you know for me the challenge is not so much technical you know how am i delivering a speech or you know is our campaign well run it has much more to do with something in your gut do you feel like you are tapped into the truth of what people are experiencing right now are you communicating a sense of why this election is so important are you able to transmit the struggles that youre hearing from the single mom or a guy whose been laid off are you able to give voice to that in a way that resonates you know youre not always there but i think what you try to do is its like hitting in baseball you know youre never going bat 1 000 but what you want is to have a good swing and make contact and hopefully your batting average improves over time
7059226 we had some wonderful candidates people who are serious and who i respect deeply it has been a difficult decision making process but im confident that from the pool that i had to choose from well have a very strong vice president who can be a good partner for me not only in campaigning but also in governing
7059227 we have plenty of work to do but you know i tend to work pretty well under pressure
7059228 the ole miss wide receivers should be a strength of the team
7059229 is the nobel prize paid in instalments or a lump sum like the lottery
7059230 like a pair of exquisite lucite heels and candy pink lip gloss thats basically all she needs and shell be ready to go
7059231 below ive also posted a picture of joes semi hot son beau biden hes also some politician like person id hit it
7059232 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
7059233 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
7059234 senator obama has not honored the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school
7059235 he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
7059236 we interpreted his words as meaning he would help fund the school either personally or by raising sponsors or both in order to give our school desperately needed modern facilities and a face lift
7059237 allora lho mandato a casa a chiarirsi le idee spiega il tecnico marted vedremo
7059238 cicinho lho mandato a casa a chiarirsi le idee spiega spalletti non era soddisfatto da come si era svolto lallenamento non gli piaciuto come ho distribuito le casacche aveva qualcosa da chiarirsi cos lho mandato a casa a farlo e marted magari se le sar chiarite
7059239 gli abbiamo chiesto se fosse stato disponibile per una situazione come la nostra spiega il tecnico cera ci ha fatto piacere ma le differenze sono incolmabili tenteremo di completare la squadra per gli impegni che saranno a lungo termine comunque noi i calciatori buoni ce li avevamo gi da prima speranze per lucraino ce ne sono solo se ci aiutano
7059240 cerano tutti racconta i miei famigliari e i miei amici i miei paesani e la mia gente erano le mie montagne le mie strade la mia piazza ho corso tante volte qui ma tra stress confusione e agitazione mi sono sempre spento a un chilometro dallarrivo
7059241 limportante era partire secco guadagnare qualcosa per gestire il vantaggio ed entrare primo nelle curve finali perch qui difficile superare e cos stato ho scelto delle traiettorie che lasciassero poche possibilit agli altri
7059242 mille analisi nessuno ha capito qualcosa ma ero sempre il primo a staccarsi mi era quasi venuta la tentazione di mollare tutto finch mia moglie elisabetta mi ha convinto ad andare in altura prima 10 12 giorni poi altre settimane anche su stelvio e pordoi e finalmente mi sono ritrovato
7059243 ho fame di risultati venerd il prologo sabato subito il primo e unico arrivo in salita lo voglio
7059244 ho dovuto chiudere su due scatti cos poi bertagnolli stato pi sveglio e bravo ad anticiparmi mi sono rifatto sotto ai 180 ma ho ormai avevo dato quasi tutto mi secca perch non mai bello sfiorare la vittoria soprattutto quando si sta bene
7059245 la liquigas ha fatto la corsa prima con stangelj wegelius e miholjevic poi con no infine con pellizotti nel finale avevo paura di piantarmi e ho aspettato troppo poi ho rimontato fino al terzo posto comunque gi una grande soddisfazione arrivare dietro a quei due
7059246 on friday morning joe biden gave us an example of a leading national politician exhibiting decency and class later in the day hillary clinton gave us an example of something else
7059247 the idea that they are competent to continue to conduct our foreign policy to make us more secure and make israel secure is preposterous every single thing theyve touched has been a near disaster

7059255 we all have that picture in our in our homes and my brother even has it tattooed on his back its that special
7059256 when we first started the record was much lower about 60 000 photos and we debated over whether wed even beat that
7059257 we had talks on many issues and also on the land issue the talks were cordial and most probably we will be able to arrive at some decision in one or two days
7059258 we have discussed and exchanged views in a cordial manner and we have decided to meet again
7059259 till now we have made a loss of about 5000 crore rupees today every businessman wants to cut down the losses and would like our brothers in the amarnath shrine board to sit with the government authorities to find a solution to it
7059260 over reacted in a totally exaggerated way with its ill advised georgian military operation
7059261 russia violated the territorial integrity and sovereignty of another state with military violence its serious russia has massively undermined its image in the world of a reliable partner for the future
7059262 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region

7059333 art is created and supported by human beings so the systems of their lives their biographies their interrelationships their artistic and personal tendencies are important to art in general i try to support and encourage people as a way of life but also as a way to help create the art i enjoy all of this is important to me art though has to survive on its own it has to exist as an esthetic experience on its own certainly the context of art human and personal history can help make some works of art mean but we must not judge art based on their creators their methods of creation or the complexity of their construction we must judge them on their effects this belief forces me to love the art of people whose personal lives or beliefs i cannot forgive because art matters even if the creation of great art does not all absolve an artist of personal iniquity

7059367 the first two songs set the albums tone the divide between ferocity and reflection soft pyramids is almost tender a sweet singalong that is starkly contrasted with its neighbor the vitriolic so many calls a jittery and sneering attack on our broken healthcare system
7059368 no damage nocturne towards the end of the album is a return to clap happy form but falls more in line with soft pyramids than line in the sand the preponderance of quiet songs on different damage does not foreshadow power in the least and that album shocked as many longtime q and not u fans as it attracted new ones
7059369 in a way im almost glad q and not u broke up after this album their evolution from an arty post hardcore dance punk band to a not so arty not even hardcore dance light on the punk band is disappointing to say the least with power they were able to curry the favor of the prevailing dance craze embodied by bands like bloc party and the rapture but this success came at the expense of their older punk ethic power finds q and not u relying on synthesizers in an unprecedented way whereas klahr and richards took turns playing bass on different damage klahr stuck almost exclusively to his keyboards and synths on this album propelling q and not u out of tiny clubs and into dance halls

7059421 that ticket from saturday was a winner id put a grand down at a hundred to one
7059422 so youre going to become a racecourse owner instead of a punter
7059423 how would you like to be the manager of an animal sanctuary
7059424 and have my car smelling like pig shit i dont think so man youll have to find another mug im staying where i am now that sams left twilight the job got a whole lot easier
7059425 this is the first meeting with the banks small business manager im going to enjoy
7059426 i wish i could remember what made benton change his mind but im glad he did
7059427 you may never know i heard he moved to the east end less competition there
7059428 im really sorry about pennie you know i liked her a lot but she always talked about you
7059429 out of all the women ive known and thats a three figure number she was the only one i thought about when i wasnt with her
7059430 theres no telling how long thisll go on for ill catch you up
7059431 why was i in love with an arrogant dick like that
7059432 youve pined for her for a long time i can see it in your aura
7059433 shes just a friend we go back a ways thats all theres never been anything between us
7059434 ask harold if youre serious he has a room or two free
7059435 its a shame i didnt know you longer than about four days
7059436 you could have had my house its too late now if id known i was about to die id have made a new will in your favour
7059437 it all gets sold and the proceeds go to the sanctuary its a registered charity
7059438 ill see you later harold were going to the funeral
7059439 there was a lot i wanted to do with my life
7059440 it must be odd for you to go to your own funeral
7059441 at least im going to have some mourners if id died a fortnight ago id just have had steve
7059442 still the vicar would have been pleased with a thirty second gap between dearly beloved and amen
7059443 can we get a move on the show starts in half an hour
7059444 it wasnt him remember hes just happy to be part of whatever his friends are doing
7059445 chase said hed be here as soon as he could
7059446 mike brandsford and inspector white they represent the community in cases like this
7059447 its nice of her to come the police must have told her about it
7059448 poor pennie will never be redeemed and is destined to spend eternity wandering the cold earth
7059449 i thought i might haunt the bahamas for a bit
7059450 its probably best thing i dont say that to your mother
7059451 we are gathered here today to pay out last respects to penelope irene lowry
7059452 paid a great deal of money to have a site declared fit for burial just dont dig too deeply else youll disturb the last incumbent
7059453 funny i dont feel nearly as upset as i thought i would
7059454 it was exactly where you said it would be in the toilet cistern
7059455 there are two bags of marbles between three people in this room and ive still got all mine where has he got all these skulls etched thats what i want to know it took me two weeks to etch the thirty one sigils of binding and then he produces another fifteen complete skulls overnight theyre all perfect too how did he do it
7059456 sam hes possessed by an exalted spirit i thought it was a demon but i was wrong it might as well be a demon to judge by the depravity
7059457 how should i know the other demon burned the one in the church perhaps hes become more saintly now that hes out of limbo
7059458 i was promised his soul if i helped him to carve these skulls and obviously thats not going to happen is it
7059459 somethings got to power these homunculi and he seems to favour human spirits you shouldnt worry though because itd have to be a voluntary act
7059460 its not like youre going to offer to obey him voluntarily is it not like the last one he worked for him so he had no choice
7059461 hes all tied up inside that plastic monstrosity probably will be for eternity
7059462 its a product of using the thirty one sigils instead of the standard twenty four
7059463 the spirit will be contained in the skull for as long as the skull is in one piece they have mahalaleel in the british museum you know it really annoys him that hes stuck there talking to deadbeats
7059464 he was the great grandson of adam before the flood
7059465 so that thing will live for as long as the skull is intact
7059466 he hasnt done the head look hes opening the mould so youll be able to see the body
7059467 do you not want to see it through to the end
7059468 of course but i know the way through the tunnels
7059469 i recognise my own body he said the plaster cast was for a sculpture
7059470 i would if i could but i cant get out of this circle not if i want to be in that room at any rate i can get out but as soon as i get anywhere within five hundred yards of this im pulled back in
7059471 i told you you cant a circle has to be collapsed by its maker and he wont do that
7059472 it would be seven of the fifty eight words of power but i dont know which seven let alone what order they were in
7059473 could you show me them and ill write them down
7059474 the first sigil is tchiphameron and it looks likes this
7059475 i never go any further than the security desk though ive never been to the laboratories
7059476 how are we going to get down my sisters down there somewhere
7059477 how come felicias got the i pod doesnt she know we need it
7059478 we need a way of ejecting pelagia from sams body
7059479 you have three minutes before i cant revive him she said
7059480 his heart has stopped will you now condemn a spirit to oblivion
7059481 i really dont think so you cant tell me what to do demon
7059482 there are fourteen skulls here only one of which holds a silent pelagia

7059532 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7059533 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7059534 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7059535 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7059536 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7059537 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7059538 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7059539 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach

7059544 what did they do that god punished them with the tsunami

7059546 for many developing countries avoiding deforestation is pretty much the only way they can engage in the climate change regime and reap some benefits
7059547 we think this is particularly relevant to africa we want this next climate regime to benefit africa
7059548 we shall perhaps see a new dawn for tropical forests
7059549 a levy of that level is about 0 6 percent of an airfare price
7059550 this is about rural communities and indigenous peoples this is about business we have got to bring communities and the private sector together
7059551 on march 31 2007 1 558 sentenced and unsentenced women were in south african prisons for violent and aggressive crimes as opposed to 27 sentenced and unsentenced for sexual crimes and 1 391 female economic offenders
7059552 this shows an increase in the female violent and aggressive population
7059553 one factor that would play a role here is greed people are getting greedier economic issues are driving them
7059554 they are intelligent and think they can get away with it most criminal masterminds are strong women who commit the crime for their own benefit but we cant clump all female criminals together
7059555 the role of a woman has always been associated with love affection protection nurturing and warmth so the idea of women committing crime and more so violent crime used to and still shocks society as females are assumed to be less criminal than men
7059556 they dont seem like they need to struggle to provide for a family there are other egocentric factors that feed into their deeds they feel powerful
7059557 in my experience female criminals are very intelligent they know what they will be doing and they come across as more cold and calculated than men
7059558 the fact is that society still believes in the innocence of females and deny their involvement in serious and aggressive crimes even when the women themselves are sentenced they may feel that they will get off lightly because of their sexuality they think they can get away with it
7059559 if women are not motivated by money or greed they could have personal or emotional issues that influence them there are also issues like drug and alcohol abuse that come into play but this would be linked to emotional personality disorders
7059560 when they are caught they are surprised and are remorseful for being caught not for the impact it has had on others
7059561 females are expected to contribute more and that is a lot of stress that is added not everyone can cope with that and it has a different effect on everybody
7059562 becoming a criminal mastermind is a lengthy process that someone follows
7059563 they dont just sit down they have to work out the details they dont do it just for fun
7059564 not every woman can become a criminal mastermind it is a particular woman with a particular profile you dont get born to do this this is something that someone decides to do
7059565 the anc in the legislature colluded with the da and voted for pietermaitzburg as the sole capital

7059573 wir verteidigen wirklich hart meine spieler haben unser defensivkonzept komplett verinnerlicht

7059582 this is without doubt the greatest mobile experimentation in politics weve ever seen
7059583 texting and cellular phones are still sort of a new frontier in politics even though they are widely used by people
7059584 its our belief that mobile will be as vital in politics in the next few years as tv and internet are today
7059585 im sure they know to the minute how many people are signing up
7059586 this notion that there is sort of a mystery and the mystery is going to be revealed is capturing some of that magic to get people involved in a very personal way
7059587 these are die hard republicans so you can imagine how many independents and fence sitters are now signed up and waiting for barack obama
7059588 his opt in e mail list is 10 million large which is tremendous
7059589 and now hes probably got a million cell phones which is incredible
7059590 people have given him a relatively personal and very direct means of getting in touch with them its not a piece of information that exists in other databases
7059591 you have to keep in mind that the most powerful social network people hold is that 20 or 30 people in our phone we call the most often tapping into that social network would be an incredible accomplishment even if it was just a half a million or a million people
7059592 a million people can then go out and reach another 20 or 30 million people
7059593 when youre in the minority you have to communicate smarter and more effectively i think republicans will indeed catch up
7059594 if you do not do it will you be able to look in the mirror in 10 years and feel good about it

7059608 but he slowed down when he had his first daughter

7059610 i had no idea he was saying he was on the olympic team
7059611 i absolutely understand if he was making claims like that people would be upset he had no choice but to resign or be fired
7059612 by sticking at a job you hate you are by definition causing yourself more stress youre forgetting about the choices you have and putting up with what you know full well you dont want to put up with the impact of the stress is cumulative and continued stress can be incredibly damaging your fuse grows shorter it gets more difficult to think clearly your motivation slips away you dont get quality sleep not even mentioning more serious conditions like depression and physical ailments like high blood pressure

7059821 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
7059822 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
7059823 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
7059824 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
7059825 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
7059826 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
7059827 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
7059828 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
7059829 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
7059830 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
7059831 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems

7059837 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7059838 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7059839 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7059840 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7059841 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7059842 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7059843 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7059844 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7059845 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7059846 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7059847 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7059848 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7059849 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
7059850 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later

7059887 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
7059888 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 legislative documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and for calling us liars
7059889 the fact is that although we have a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
7059890 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
7059891 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
7059892 i have a 25 year pro life record thats my commitment to you
7059893 obama believes that upon being elected president of the united states he could sign an executive order that would overturn the bush position on stem cell research and open up the avenues considerably
7059894 if were successful there will be language in that plank or elsewhere that mccain wants to take a different track in dealing with abortion
7059895 in a close election pro life voters make the difference
7059896 if john mccain is to win in november he must keep faith with the pro life and pro family base of the party
7059897 the targeting of the champions my fathers champions here on earth the hosts of hell have been assigned for the past decades waiting for this hellish moment in the spirit realm listening for the release of my end time move from heaven they have heard the mighty rush of my holy angels and so in turn they have unleashed the most violent satanic assault that earth has yet seen since the days of my birth when satans wrath was unleashed through herod against the babes in arms in a huge murderous onslaught
7059898 the champions of my fathers household think they are prepared
7059899 and that is good and right but they also do not fear the father they rely on their own strength on their own integrity on their own valor
7059900 you cannot yet understand with what tremendous passion and compassion the father holds for his redeemed ones they are his greatest treasures in the universe he delights in his children he longs for their fellowship for their communion with him the father does not base his love for his household on their gifting or talent or on those who in the worlds eyes have so much to offer but he has delighted to choose the foolish things of the earth for in his great and unfathomable wisdom he knew that those who realize that they are the most undeserving will be those who have fully embraced the fact that without his love they are completely unqualified many of those that the father views as his greatest generals and champions have been assailed violently by assignments of the enemy each assignment is an assignment of seduction planned by satan himself the seducing powers and principalities have but one aim to seduce my household away from me and my father i am not talking about the new believers i am not talking about the immature or even the young men i am talking about my leaders my generals my priests those who are well versed in me those who have seen terrible battles those who have fought with me in the dark places of the earth those who have led thousands upon thousands to me across the nations those who have built great churches those who have brought in generational moves i am talking about the apostles the prophets the pastors the teachers the evangelists and i tell you my daughter a great and terrible coldness has been unleashed a coldness of heart that will imbue and infect even some of my champions spirits and so brother shall rise up against brother minister against minister sons against fathers husbands against wives and the great falling away shall begin but it shall begin in my own household
7059901 and it shall start with those who have been closest to us
7059902 i tell you that i have seen my children these my ministers sit in their homes and at their church banquets gossiping about these fallen ones i have seen them expose their sin expose their nakedness and say this is a terrible damage to the gospel as if in shock and as in horror but these have fallen victim to the pride of life and i am grieved with a great grieving for indeed pride says it is by my own hand and by my own sufficiency that i keep the law and self righteousness despises the weaker and encourages itself in its own strength to keep but i tell you that in these coming days all that is not rooted in dependence upon me and my father and upon my grace shall fall and even as satan fell so i grieve for some of my called out ones for they lean on their own understanding they lean on their own integrity they lean on their own morality they lean on their own proficiency and they pride themselves that they are not weak like other men but i tell you that even as satan fell from beholding himself as greater so many of these my elect shall fall from beholding themselves instead of beholding me and so when pride takes root in some of my servants with it shall come a deadly self righteousness and a critical denigrating spirit as they compare themselves to others and they shall see the faults and the failings and the specks in their companions and their colleagues and their leaders eyes and yet they shall completely ignore the beam in their own and the terrible coldness talked about in my word shall grip their hearts and they shall not even realize that they have fallen away for they shall be so sure of themselves and their boasting in me tell my ministers to check their hearts lest satan seduce them away from their childlike trust and dependence on me
7059903 i have loved these men they loved me for many many years with a pure heart but they fell into jezebels snare and were deceived many of my servants today face the same pitfalls many have served us day by day in the hidden places of service unseen by man but known of me many of them have poured out their lives and their substance for the sake of the gospel and for my kingdom but they have seen little fruit some have done mighty exploits some have faithfully served day by day but many so many have become weary and are ready to faint for jezebel has sent her message to them saying i will make your life as one of them slain by the sword tomorrow and so the father of lies has sown seeds of deception in my servants souls questioning their faithfulness questioning my protection that my servants have began to doubt my very hand upon their lives and they have become depressed and dismayed and lost their purpose that once was so clear and like elijah they cry out and i only i am left and the enemy seeks my life to take it away many of these ones in the past years have given themselves to activity rather than to intimate fellowship with me it is essential that in this season that they take time out and draw aside to me in intimacy in my presence so that they can find refreshing this assignment is far more deadly to those who are called to do as martha than those who sit like mary many of these have great administrative gifts they are ably equipped to do they are equipped to run ministries equipped to run churches equipped to run businesses others have become so caught up in the activity of ministering to others that they have been caught up in the activity of serving and have lost intimacy with me and have become depleted the more intensely discouraged that my servants become the more they have leaned on natural carnal methods to change their circumstance and have become spiritually depleted this discouragement in turn has kept them away from my face and my presence where they would find my supernatural encouragement strength fortitude and divine strategy to unlock their circumstances tell them they must draw unto me i am their lifegiver i am their encourager i am their anchor i am their sustenance that i would allure these my children to myself and gently as my angel spoke to elijah say child arise and eat draw aside and replenish yourself guard your minds and hearts from the father of all lies and deceiver of your souls
7059904 those who have been forgiven much love much in this last generation many came to us from the greatest ensnarements and bondages once they saw our great love for them they became our greatest champions and bondservants for their gratitude for receiving such a redemption was unfathomable these are the ones who have become close and tender with me who would follow me unto death
7059905 every fissure each wound each broken place that lies unhealed these satanic powers and principalities and demons shall now target many many of my children did not receive healing of their minds emotions and souls in this last generation and because they have lived in the household of god for years many do not even realize that these scarred places exist these last days assignments have been meticulously strategized and that is the very strength of their evil they have been tailor made to each of my champions they know the urgent driving unmet needs of the soul the generational bondages of each individual called by me to impact this generation the lack of nurturing the deep unhealed rejections and hurts of the emotions the fatherlessness the need for affirmation the desire to belong the deep isolations all of which when not met in me now have laid the perfect snare for the assignments of the enemy some of my champions have experienced a violent satanic assailing against their minds any thought not taken captive shall be a thought that can take violent root in their soul to lead to ensnarement anything from their past that has been dealt with by their own strength and not by my spirit shall become a snare to them and can leave them vulnerable to the enemy of their souls any habit not ruthlessly dealt with and put to the cross when assigned with the searing heat of temptation will breed and rapidly multiply
7059906 in this past age jezebel has translated itself into many different forms but one of her primary rules in this present age is her amalgamation with babylon the spirit of the world and lust lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life jezebel rules electronic media film television advertising she is the epitome of seduction in this last age she was delilah salome herodias she rules pornography adultery lasciviousness homosexuality pride power separation divorce ambition and every perversion and sin of the flesh known to mankind she tantalizes packages sin sells it and then debases and exposes her victims before killing her primary targets in this last church age are my ministers both men and women
7059907 firstly to repent of any and of all lukewarmness and backsliding in your heart and to reignite and maintain zealously your first love for me secondly to keep yourself from all idols and remain fervent in the spirit which is the result of true fellowship in spirit and in truth with myself and the father and of feeding on my word until my words are spirit and life to you
7059908 and finally the cross the deception in every temptation is that which caused adam to lead billions of souls into sin that of selfishness temptation promises that which self desires when my children desire the promises of sin more than they desire me they will fall
7059909 the road from 9 11 through chechnya to bali and now mombasa is a clear one
7059910 small al qaeda groups can infiltrate in and out very quickly weapons are available everywhere it is not complex these are not large groups of people just two or three who plan for a while and then launch several rockets

7059914 even had the chutzpah to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the justice department despite the fact that hamas and the palestine islamic jihad are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law we expect the bank of china to now pay very heavily for its support for terrorism
7059915 any attempt to try and bridge the gap between israel and the palestinians in any way other than a detailed agreement may lead to violent clashes
7059916 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
7059917 syria keeps violating the weapons embargo but is able to win recognition by holding indirect peace talks with israel
7059918 its trying to regain its legitimacy despite its support of terror organizations
7059919 i n principle yes we have not thought of it yet no such proposal has been received in any case all similar projects must be first studied by military experts and when everything is decided we will make an open and public announcement

7059922 following the surprising discoveries of the dangerous role israel played in transferring weapons to georgia and the involvement of israeli mossad in carrying out terror attacks against russian citizens in south ossetia and abkhazia
7059923 halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
7059924 it is a mutual interest of russia of israel and of the pragmatic leaders and states in the region not to send long range missiles to syria

7059936 no existe una normativa que impida que una persona voluntariamente pueda bajarse del avi n
7059937 es el nico que tiene la capacidad de decidir sobre lo que ocurre a bordo del avi n tanto si se puede bajar como si no
7059938 con ello no quiero insinuar que la responsabilidad fue del comandante en alg n aspecto que pudo fallar sino que su facultad es la de evaluar la situaci n en cada vuelo

7059943 plenamente recogido por el fabricante la compa a y los t cnicos de mantenimiento por lo que se certific y se document siguiendo normas reguladas por aviaci n espa ola y ese avi n sali en condiciones de seguridad ptimas
7059944 el comandante tiene la facultad de darle salida a ese vuelo y eso es lo que ocurri lo que pas despu s desafortunadamente no podemos especular ni entrar a hablar de ello porque es una competencia exclusiva de la comisi n de investigaci n

7059984 there is a term in english crazy empire a psychic empire the latest illustration of this madness is what is now happening in pakistan
7059985 pervez musharraf had for nine years been head of pakistan americas strategic ally in the region and the only nuclear power in the islamic world after 11 september musharraf supported the usas fight against and taleban in the neighboring afghanistan despite the prevailing sentiments in the country he harshly suppressed radical islamist rallies in the country he has had to resign as a result of democratization imposed by the united states which has already led to destabilization and a most serious crisis in pakistan
7059986 musharraf was the only leader who could maintain stability in an extremely complex country like pakistan restrain radical islamists and guarantee that the nuclear potential would remain under control the so called oppositions corrupt leaders let out of an american english jar hate each other and are incapable of ensuring either in the view of responsible american analysts the pakistani bomb is much more dangerous than the non existent iranian one who gets it and what happens to this not quite low priority and not the least populated region this is what the united states european partners should be thinking about not about the moaning of a whipped georgian paranoid man
7059987 that sounds like a pretty accurate description of the whole situation
7059988 obviously it sounds like hes an intelligence specialist in that area
7059989 it was obvious in the discussions i had with people that while pakistan was already a mess by this concession of dumping musharraf you actually unleash all the instabilities in the area
7059990 the saudi bandar al yamameh operation is whats key here

7059994 and frankly we are looking at world war iii nuclear world war iii
